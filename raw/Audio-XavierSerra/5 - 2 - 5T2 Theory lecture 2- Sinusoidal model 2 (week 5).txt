Welcome again to the course on audio
signal processing for music applications.
This week
we're talking about the sinusoidal model.
And in the previous theory lecture
we presented the actual model and
a little bit about how these sinusoids can
be, visualized in the spectral domain.
So, let's continue with that.
We'll first overview
a little bit of the model.
Then focus on the idea of detecting
peaks in the spectral domain,
which are going to be our sinusoids.
And also we're going to be talk
about how to track them in time.
So these sinewaves vary in time
in a particular sound.
So how can we track
these time-varying
sinewaves in spectrogram.
The sine model is simple, 
is a sum of time-varying
sinusoids, and in the previous class
we made emphasis on this idea that
we need to detect the sinusoids in the
frequencies domain, therefore we need to
choose a window size that is good enough
to be able to isolate those sinusoids, or
at least be able to visually have 
separate peaks for these sinusoids, okay?
In this particular case,
these two sinusoids 440 and 490,
we need a window size of
5,291 samples in order for
being able to have these two main lobes
separate, but how do we measure the values
of the sinusoids in the spectrum?
Well, if we choose the window
size correctly, as we showed,
we will have a peak for
every sinusoid in the signal.
Then to measure the frequency and
amplitude of each sinusoid
we have to just find the tip
of the peak and it's height.
So we define a peak as the location
in the magnitude spectrum.
So p sub r, the peak, is going to be
the magnitude spectrum at the location
k sub 0, when the previous location,
So the location of the spectrum
when k sub 0 minus 1 is a smaller.
And the next location so the location
at the k sub 0 plus 1 is also smaller.
So that's going to be what
we call a local maximum.
So in this plot we see a local maxima for
the different peaks, okay?
So the crosses,
the blue crosses, are local maxima and
also in the phase spectrum; what
we basically do is just read
the location of these local
maxima in the phase spectrum.
So we have with this procedure
we have the location of the
peak, which is going to be k sub 0.
Then we have the magnitude,
it's going to be mX of k sub 0.
And we have
the phase, which is
going to be pX of k sub 0.
But there's a little problem.
In fact, you can visually
identify this problem.
There is not enough resolution.
So, one solution to this resolution
problem is to do zero-padding.
We use and FFT size
much larger than the window size and
we have been talking about that.
So for example in this particular example,
we have increased the FFT size
of the previous example by 2.
The window size was the same
but we added zeros to the end,
up to the next power of 2.
This result into
a much smoother spectrum.
And now the local maximum,
computed in the same way, so
these blue crosses, are much better.
They're located in,
visually you can see that,
they're located in a better place.
They're
located in a place that looks like
it's more the center of the peak.
And therefore the magnitude and
the phase will be better.
But, if we want a good enough resolution,
we will need to increase the
FFT size a lot.
And that will be quite
computationally expensive.
So is there any other solution?
Well, yes.
We can do a cheaper interpolation
by using, for example,
parabolic interpolation, The parabola is
a function with a shape quite similar
to the tip of lobe of the spectrum of
the analysis window, in the dB scale.
So this is the equation of a parabola.
Where p is the center of the parabola,
a is the concavity measure and
b is the offset.
And this is a sampled version of the
parabola, so we have different values n.
And so, this is very similar to what
we would see as a sampled function.
Okay?
So to perform a parabolic
interpretation on a spectral peak
we can just use the three highest
values of the magnitude of the peak.
For example in this case,
the k minus one, k, and
k plus one locations of
the mX spectrum can be
considered to be the three
highest values of a parabola.
So x minus one, x zero, and x one.
And then we can apply 
the equation of the parabola
in a way to find where would
be the center of this parabola.
And the center of the parabola would be
defined by this equation which k sub p,
which would be frequency, or
the location of the center,
would be equal to this k,
that was the highest point, plus these
values, which is
going to be the previous and
the next values computed 
in this way.
And then it's going to be very easy
to read what would be the amplitude
of this value, so
we can basically plug in the interpolated
k sub p into the parabolic equation and
obtain the amplitude,
the height, of this peak.
Okay, so with this equation,
basically, we can
refine the peak positions, and
we can combine it with the zero padding.
So to get a much better result.
So this example is exactly that.
There is some
parabolic interpretation
together with some zero padding.
and if you would zoom in to this,
you would see that this is
quite a bit better than
the two previous examples,
the one without any zero padding or
the one with just zero padding.
This will give us quite a good
measure of frequency, amplitude and
phase of all the sinusoids
present in a spectrum.
And we will get this,
so we'll get a value of
the frequency location of peak,
k sub p, and it will be computed
with this equation, then we
can convert this k into
hertz, into frequency, by multiplying
by the sampling rate and dividing by N.
Then we can compute the amplitude,
by using this parabolic idea.
And finally the phase will
be very straight forward.
We can just read the phase
of that location, and
this doesn't even have to have
any interpolation, by just reading
the closest that should be enough.
But these are the values
of a single frame,
and the sinusoidal model is
about time varying sounds.
So time varying sinusoids.
So how do we go about that?
So we have to deal with spectrograms,
and find time varying sinusoids, and
we will define a time varying sinusoid as
a stable peak track in the spectrogram.
So this variability will be
constrained, and we will define 
peaks that evolve in time, that sort
of move in time, but not so much.
And this stability
will be measured by the frequency and
amplitude of successive frames.
We could also look at the phase
derivative in time-frequency, for that.
In practice we're going to just focus on
the frequency and amplitude variability.
But the phase is also a very
interesting value to look at.
So, the condition for
a peak of a frame to be part of
a track is defined by this equation.
So a peak, a particular frequency
of a peak f sub p, of a given
frame, l, will
be part of a track if the
distance between that frequency and
the frequency of the previous frame,
so the track is coming from
the previous frame,
if the absolute value of this
difference is smaller than a threshold.
And also if exists a track for
a certain amount of time.
So we will be making a constraint
in terms of the frequency,
in terms if it doesn't change that much.
And at the same time we will
make it a constraint in
terms of how long has this track
been in existence, if it's too short,
it means it's like a short burst, and
that's not really a sinusoid.
So this is an example of tracking
these sinewaves in a sound.
In a Bendir.
Bendir is a drum used in Turkey and
several other places.
So it is a non-harmonic sound so
is a sound that is quite complex but
it has partials.
It has sinusoids and we contract them so
with these algorithm, these
black lines correspond to the tracking.
But let's hear the Bendir first.
[SOUND] Okay, so it's a instrument
that doesn't have a clear pitch and
therefore the tracks are a little 
bit kind of a very
unstable and they keep changing,
appearing and disappearing.
So this is what we will find.
And also we can look at the same
track in the phase spectrum.
So if we take the phase spectrogram,
which is the derivative of the phase and
we plot those black lines,
the frequency tracks on top of that,
we get this result.
And it's quite interesting because
clearly we see that the black tracks
are in the places where
the color is clear.
And these are the locations
where the phases changes less,
where there is more phase continuity.
So these indicate that also
the phase information would be
quite relevant in tracking
these sinusoids because
the phase information allows us to
distinguish this variability
stability aspect of a given partial.
So sorry there are not that many
references on these topics, so
a part from the Wikipedia entry for 
sinusoidal model, or, of course,
Julius Smith discussion on
spectral analysis on his online book.
And that's basically it.
So this is all for this lecture.
We have presented Sinusoidal model,
a sound representation built on top
of the short-time Fourier transform
that reduces the amount of information and
that gets rid of none-relevant
spectral components.
However its use for the analysis of
sound is not as easy as the use the STFT.
We have to understand even
more about spectra and
about windows in order to
make good use of this model.
Hopefully by now you are starting
to get a grasp on that.
Now we have to complete the explanation
of the Sinusoidal model by
describing the synthesis part.
And this is what we will be
doing in the next lecture.
So, I hope to see you then.
Bye, bye.
