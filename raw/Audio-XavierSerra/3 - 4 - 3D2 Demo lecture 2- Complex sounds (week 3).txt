Hello, welcome back to the course on
audio signal processing for music applications.
In the previous demonstration class
we talked about periodic signals.
Those were very simple signals,
generated synthetically,
and using Audacity we tried to
make sense of them by looking at
the time waveform and
by looking at the spectrum.
Now I want to go to complex sounds.
So to sounds that have much
more complexity than those ones and
see what we can do with it.
Okay so we'll start with SonicVisualizer
and we will open up a file.
So let's open a speech file.
Okay so this is sound of a male speech.
Let's hear that.
>> Do you hear me?
They don't lie at all.
>> Okay, now we can of course zoom in
into different parts of the sound and
we will see that there are some
parts that are more periodic,
some parts that are not periodic at all.
So for example this end, this ending.
That we can also select and play.
[SOUND] Okay, it has different
portions that we can analyze.
For example here in the
middle it has the more
voiced portion of “at all”.
So if we zoom in we'll see
that it's quite periodic.
Of course it changes quite a bit but
it has some repeating
patterns that evolve in time.
Instead at the beginning of the
attack of this sound
it has the T sound and
this clearly is non-periodic.
So we see that it's quite noisy.
Is the consonants that
is very much non-periodic.
Okay.
In order to reinforce these ideas we can
of course use the spectral analysis.
In Sonic Visualizer there is the concept
of panes and we have the different
panes that we can display and
there is one that is a spectrum.
Okay so this is the spectrum of this sound
at the particular location at
the cursor that we are in.
And as I said in the previous
class it's better to
visualize the horizontal in linear steps,
and maybe put here in lines and
then kind of maybe have
a better dB range to look at.
And if we are in the kind of the vowel
type of area we kind of see
the peaks that correspond to
the harmonics of this sound.
Instead, if we go to
the beginning, this attack, the T
,sound, clearly this is much noisy and
is more difficult to see.
Maybe if we change the DFT
size by changing it here.
We might be able to see
a little bit better.
So this is a size we'll
take 2048 samples.
And we will see little bit
differently the spectrum,
okay let's look at another
maybe more complex sound.
Then let's look at for
example this cello double.
This is a sound that there is two notes.
Let's hear that.
[MUSIC]
Okay so it's not a monophonic sound,
it's a polyphonic sound.
And these two frequencies, we
can hear them quite well,
one is quite stable and it goes
throughout in the same frequency and
then there is this little
scale going up and down.
Okay, so if we zoom in into here
we will see that
it's very hard to see any periodicity.
Because, of course, we have these two
sounds playing at the same time.
In some areas there might be
kind of the two notes they
might reinforce each other in terms
of frequency and we might see some
periodic oscillation.
But typically that's
going to be quite hard.
So here we might figure some
periodic oscillation for example.
Okay in the spectral domain, so
if we compute the pane and we
show the spectrum, here again we
will do with linear lines here and
then maybe zoom so that we see better.
Okay here,
well we see that things change and
we can identify the harmonics of these
two kind of melodies playing together.
If we would zoom into here and, too bad
that Sonic Visualizer doesn't allow me to
zoom into this for region,
we would see the different
harmonics of the two voices that
are being sounding together.
So clearly in the spectral domain
we can try to identify things that
in the time domain are much harder.
And we can step through the sound and
figure out different aspects.
And then let me finish by presenting an
even more complex sound that I don't think
even with the spectrum analysis we can
make some sense out of that, that's for
example this orchestral sound,
this orchestral sound we can play it
[MUSIC]
Okay it's a full orchestra
with many string instruments.
It's a Chinese orchestra playing.
And there is percussion instruments,
a whole bunch of things.
So if we zoom in very hardly
we will make sense of any of it.
It looks basically like a random noise.
But of course there's a lot
of structure into it.
Hopefully
the spectral analysis should allow us
to make some sense out of all this.
So if we open the spectrum pane and
then again we change it to linear,
we put it smoother.
And we tried to make
very, better visualization
well it's very difficult
but we will learn that there are
some clear pics here that with
them we can make some sense
of some of the prominent
voices that emerge.
So we will try to understand it, but
of course this is very difficult.
In fact it's beyond the kind of spectral
analysis that we will do in this class.
This requires certain techniques that
in fact are still open research problems.
And it's very difficult to analyze
a signal as complex as this one.
But basically that's all I wanted to say.
and
we have used is a SonicVisualizer to
analyze different types of real sounds.
We analyzed speech sound,
we analyzed a cello sound that had two
melodies, two notes playing at the same time.
And then this orchestral sound. All of 
these sounds are in Freesound.
But we have seen that
it's not easy. Of course
Real sounds are very complex,
maybe the speech is the easiest.
We can try to grasp something when there
is several melodies being played at
the same time but of course in a full
orchestra that's really difficult.
But anyway we do not desperate, we will
try to make some sense out of that.
In the next classes we'll
learn about how to handle them.
So that's all for today.
We tried to complement what we mentioned
last time with periodic signals and
trying to analyze complex sounds and
we used Sonic Visualizer which allows
us to visualize some of the spectral
analysis a little bit better than Audacity.
And and that's all for today, so
next class we will introduce our tools,
the ones that we have developed,
the sms-tools to try to
see if with those tools
we can do something else
in terms of analyzing sounds.
So, thank you for your attention,
and I'll see you next time.
