Welcome back to the course on audio
signal processing for music applications.
This week we are talking
about the harmonic model.
And in these demonstration classes,
we are trying to understand this model by
actually using it, by analyzing
some sounds and synthesizing them.
In this lecture I want to go
a little bit beyond what we did and
analyze a fragment of a sound
and see if we can take it to the limit and
see what is its potential and
its limitations.
So in particular, we will be analyzing the
little few notes of a cello that I played.
The cello is of course
a great instrument,
it's a very traditional instrument that
you can do a lot of things with it.
So a good way
to get a grasp of the types of
sounds that the cello does is to look in freesound,
and just search for violoncello,
okay, and
that will give you a few samples of
different types of cello sounds, so
in fact, for example the first one
as a kind of an extended technique.
So let's listen to that.
[SOUND] Okay that's what is called
a seagull effect, and it is kind
of an interesting sound. Of course you can also
get some more tradition notes playing
what is called tenuto
[SOUND]
Or also with the cello you can
play pizzicato notes and this is a pizzicato note.
[SOUND].
But of course you can find many
types of sounds and little fragments.
The sound I will be using is a small,
short cello phrase
from a very traditional catalan song,
the song of the birds.
And in fact it's the one that I used in
the teaser of the course.
In fact let's listen to that one.
[SOUND] Okay so let's
analyze this sound.
And let's open the sms-tools GUI and
we'll first start from
the short-time Fourier transform.
This is a time varying sound so
we need the short time Fourier
transform to get a grasp of it.
Let’s open the sound, 
cello-phrase right here.
Okay and
okay we have to choose the parameters.
Instead of a hamming window
let's choose the blackman
window, the blackman window
the main lobe is wider than the
the hamming, but the side lobes are lower.
And that may be good for this sound.
So let's choose a blackman window.
And then okay, window size, we don't
have much to decide from.
But let's just, for
example, let's use 1001 samples.
Just leave that fft size at 1024.
And the fft size, the hop size has to be
at least one fourth of the window size.
So let's use 250.
Okay, and now we compute that.
This is a longer fragment so
it's going to take a little bit longer.
and, we will be able to, okay,
visualize the magnitude spectrum and
the phase spectrum.
Now what we are interested is in
deciding what parameters are needed
in order to be able to distinguish
the harmonics of these phrases.
So in fact, an important thing is
to identify what is the lowest
fundamental that is being played.
The lowest fundamental will be the one
that will determine the minimum
distance between two harmonics.
So let's zoom into the very
bottom of this spectrogram.
Okay.
Okay, so this is the first and
a little bit of the second harmonic,
so it's a very clear harmonic sound.
And we can see that it starts a little
bit low and it goes up and then it goes down.
So, clearly the lowest frequencies
are going to be the first and the last.
But here we see that the resolution is not
so good, in fact we see these boxes, kind
of this quantization, in the horizontal
axis. In the vertical axis is
pretty good, you have 250 samples,
so there is quite a lot of frames.
But there is not that many in terms of
frequency samples in order
to be able to visualize.
And then further on
analyze the peak of this harmonic.
So let's increase, maybe the window
size can not be increased,
because then you would
lose the time solution.
But let's increase the fft size so
we get a smoother spectral more samples.
For example let's say
4096, so quite a bit more,
of the fft size.
So this will give us quite
a bit of zero padding, and
therefore will give us many more
samples in the frequency range,
even though the actual data
points will be the same.
So well again this takes
a little bit to compute.
Okay so this is the spectrum.
Clearly there is a more fine
resolution than before.
Let let's do the same thing.
Let's zoom into the very
bottom of the spectrum.
Okay and yeah.
Now we definitely have many
more frequency samples.
And though of course it looks similar, but
we now would be able to see
the center of the window much better.
So if we look, like in the last note but
at the center of this, looking at the
y axis, it's around 348 hertz, okay?
So that would be the lowest note.
And the highest note is around 456 hertz,
okay?
So this is good information for
deciding now 
the window size that we should use.
So in fact okay,
let's do the sinusoidal model.
And let's look at this information.
So in order to decide what is the period
length so we have to take 44,100, and
divide it by that frequency which was
around 300, let's say and 40 hertz.
It's okay to make it a little bit lower,
so
this is 129 samples and
then if we use, for example,
the blackman window
well we would need six times that.
So if we take six times this.
Okay.
That would give us 778 samples, okay,
so let's put in the window size,
778 samples.
That should be enough to discriminate the
the harmonics.
And the fft size, I think it was good
to have this big fft size, so
4,096 was a good choice.
And that gave us a good a
resolution, that means a visually.
And now of course in the sinusoidal
model we can choose the thresold,
the minimum duration of the sinusoids, and
how many sinusoids we want to track,
the maximum frequency deviation, here
we should think have it a little bit bigger
because there is
quite a bit of deviation.
Okay.
And now, let's of course,
choose the cello sound,
the cello phrase.
And we will compute it.
Okay, so this is the sinusoidal analysis.
And yeah, we see the harmonics
following kind of the melody.
We also see
short sinusoids, in fact if with zoom in
into one region of that.
For example, let's
show this region here.
Okay, we see, well definitely
the harmonics, but also we some lines
in between them.
Then we see some trajectories
stopping and continuing, anyway,
So this is the sinusoidal model,
if we listen to the result
[SOUND].
Well, it's pretty good.
Maybe, we're losing a little bit of
of the attacks of the notes.
But it's pretty good so let's go
directly now to the harmonic model.
And let’s, okay we use
the same cello phrase and
let's use the blackman window, let's use the same
700 we should have an
odd sized window so
let's use 779, in terms of the fft
size again, I think it was a good
choice 4096, a lot of zero padding.
The magnitude threshold minus 90,
That's okay.
The duration of the tracks,
Okay, so
this will will require to be 0.1 seconds.
I think we can even make it bigger.
So let's say 0.2 seconds.
And the number maximum of harmonics
there is clearly no need for 100.
In fact a way to check how many
harmonics are needed, is
if we divide 44,100 by
the frequency, the lowest
frequency, okay now
we have to divide half of the sampling rate so
22050 divided by the lowest
frequency, so 64, that would be
the maximum number of harmonic that
we would have if we really would have all
the harmonics in the lowest note.
So no need for 100, let's say,
let's put 60 would be plenty.
And here, now is where we have to choose
a range that includes all of this melody.
So we said that
the lowest frequency was around 340.
Let's make it safer, so let's make
300 and the highest was about 450 or
something,
so let's make it quite a bit higher
just in case, let's make it 500, okay?
And this is a an error threshold
that will be quite relevant now, for
identifying the fundamental frequency.
But let's just leave it as it is now.
And see if we'll have to change it later.
Okay so now we'll compute it.
Oh, again this will take a little bit of time.
Okay, so this is
the harmonics that it has obtained.
And that looks pretty good.
It found quite a bit of harmonics.
Of course, in the transitions that where
the problems, or at least the deviations, you
know the deviations occurs if we
just zoom into just one transition.
Let's say, so this is where
the harmonics of course get lost.
And then they are picked up again.
If we listen, well let's plot that again.
That, to the original, and
if we listen to the synthesized
[MUSIC]
Okay, that's pretty good, now in terms
of this error threshold
of the algorithm, if we make it more
restrictive, so that means that
unless it's below a certain error
it will not be accepted,
we might see then that some of these
areas it does not find a fundamental. 
So instead of seven, let's put for example,
two, and let's see what it finds.
Okay, so now we see the result.
And we clearly see that in the transitions
there are gaps, and this is because in
the transitions, the fundamental is not very clear,
we are in kind of an attack,
a noise attack.
So it has lost a little bit of the
transitions, and if you listen to that,
in fact,
we're going to listen to these gaps.
[SOUND] Okay, so
there are gaps in the transitions,
because that's where
the area were we didn’t find the
the fundamental and
therefore it didn't find any harmonics,
and that's basically all I wanted to say.
So let's go back to the slides, and
well we have used the sms
tools GUI in order to analyze
this cello fragment,
then we have used the short time Fourier
transform, the sinusoidal model,
and then the harmonic model,
to see this phrase and
to analyze the harmonics, and we can see
that by tweaking the parameters we can get
quite a bit of difference in the way
that these harmonics are analyzed.
So that's all, and this is all for the
demo classes of this harmonic model week.
So hopefully this has given you
a view of how the harmonic model can
actually be used in practice.
And still it's not ideal and
there is some parts of the sound,
especially like in this sound
that we just heard, in the
attacks, that we lose a little
bit of the sound that is present there.
So the next week we will extend
the idea of this sinusoidal and
harmonic model, to include that aspect,
to include what we will call
the residual or the stochastic component.
Hopefully that will allow us
to generalize our models and
to be able to handle
many more types of sound.
So we'll see you in next class.
Thank you very much.
