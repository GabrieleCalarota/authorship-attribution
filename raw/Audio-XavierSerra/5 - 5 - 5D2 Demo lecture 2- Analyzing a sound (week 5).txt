Welcome to the course on audio signal
processing for music applications.
In the previous demonstration
lecture of this week
we talked about the sinusoidal model,
from a practical perspective.
So we analyzed some sounds,
some simple sounds.
And we tried to figure out what parameters,
from the sinusoidal model,
would give us a good visualization and
re-synthesis of the sound.
So we want to
complicate it a little more, by choosing
a little bit more complex sound.
So, we are going to analyze the Mridangam.
The Mridangam is an instrument,
a percussive instrument.
From the south of India that is played
as part of the Carnatic music tradition.
And in this picture in fact,
we're seeing Ajay on the Mridangam and
he's a T.A. of this course.
And in the voice,
singing, is Vighnesh.
Which is also a collaborator
in our group and we are 
also going to be analyzing
some of his sounds.
So let's go find some Mridangam sounds.
And of course what we would do is
go into freesound.
So if we look for Mridangam in freesound.
Now we're going to see, well,
there are quite a few sounds.
There are 7,000 sounds of the Mridangam,
that's pretty good.
And the first one,
let's maybe just open this first one,
And in fact it's a sound
that was uploaded by Ajay.
And we can listen to it.
[SOUND]
Okay, that's
pretty nice.
The Mridangam is a
very interesting instrument.
It produces quite a few different
qualities of sound, the way
the instrument is hit and
there is different bowls, that are called,
to produce different sound qualities.
And rhythmically is really complex.
I mean, the music of
the Carnatic music tradition.
And the way that the Mridangam is played
it explores very sophisticated and
complex rhythmic structures.
Let's just use one of these sounds.
In fact, as part of the package of sounds
that we are using for this class,
there is a sound by Ajay.
In fact it's this fragment here.
And we can also listen for that one.
'Kay so this is the sound.
And we can play it.
[SOUND] 'Kay so
let's analyze this sound by Ajay.
Let's open the sms-tools GUI.
And let's start by looking at
the short time Fourier transform.
So we'll go and get a mono version
of this sound, Mridangam sound.
Okay, and we have to decide what
parameters to use, so before we can
really make any decision letâ€™s just
takes some default kind of parameters.
For example, let's use Hanning window,
that's kind of a default
window that works quite well.
In terms of the window size okay,
we don't know much, but okay, let's
start with 1,000 samples of the window.
The FFT size,
when we don't know much about it
the bigger the better,
if it does not take too long.
So okay, so
4,096 seems like a good enough number.
And the hop size, well it should be
the smaller possible,
because percussive instrument,
with this sharp attacks,
it's good that we have a lot of frames and
we can have 
like a decent time resolution.
So let's compute this, okay.
So this is
the result, the output should be
the same because we haven't done much
[MUSIC]
Yeah.
it's the same,
we haven't done much to it and
the hop size is in a good 
relation with the window size.
Now what basically would like to is
understand a little bit the sound so
that we can better choose the parameters.
So, let's think about the window
size that best fits this sound.
So for doing that
let's zoom into one of these sounds.
For example, this one looks good
because it has a lot of horizontal lines.
Okay?
So these are the partials of the sound.

It's a membrane that creates 
some vibrations.
They may not be completely harmonic,
but clearly there are
some very stable partials of the sound, of
the resonance of the instrument.
And we would like to see what is the
minimum distance between two partials,
so that we can decide what is
the resolution that we need,
the best resolution that we need.
Okay?
And by looking here
where the cursor is, we can see, for
example, that this first horizontal line
is around 200 hertz, and
the second one is around 400 hertz.
Okay?
So that means that according to this,
at least
the minimum distance between two
consecutive partials is around 200 Hertz,
okay.
So from that we can try to compute
an appropriate window size. 
As we said in theory class, we have to
start with number of bins of a window.
So, let's start with this Hamming Window,
so it's four bins and
let's multiply it by the sampling rate,
44100, and divide it by the frequency
resolution we want to have.
In this case we make a guess of
200 hertz, that we identified as
a distance that was
present in these sounds.
Okay, so this is 882 samples.
Okay, so we would need these 881, or
lets say 83 samples, so that we have
a value
that is an odd size.
Let's still keep the FFT size big.
So, there's no harm on that.
And in terms of the hop size, well it
looks like we can have a smaller one.
So let's see,
220, that would be 1 4th of that.
Okay?
And let's compute it.
That's not that different
from where we started.
So in fact
where we started was pretty good.
Okay.
So this is the kind of analysis that
should be okay according to this measure.
Now, let's analyze the sound
using the Sinusoidal model.
So let's go to the interface,
and let's open the sine model.
So let's go for
the Mridangam sound, okay?
And well, we have to choose 
the parameters for
that, so let's use the same ones,
So, we have this 800,
around 883 samples.
Lets use the same, the hamming window.
The FFT size, lets leave it to this 4096.
Magnitude threshold,
maybe we do not need that much.
Let's say minus 60.
duration, well let's make sure
that we have good enough tracks, so
0.05.
Number of sinusoids, 150,
Yeah, we need quite a bit.
Deviation, doesn't deviate that much
the sinusoids in this type of sounds.
So, this will be okay.
Let's just first try this one.
Let's see what we get.
Well, not that much, okay?
So we have analyzed the sound and
we obtained very few sinusoids,
and if we listen to the result,
[MUSIC]
well, not much there,
it has some sound, but not much.
So, what can we improve from this.
Well, the window size, 
I guess it was all right.
Clearly the magnitude threshold could be lower,
because clearly this sound
was not recorded very loud.
And a lot of these things, especially
within the decay, is quite soft.
And clearly the sinusoidal
tracks could be shorter.
Because the strokes are very short.
And some of these trajectories
are going to be very short.
So let's have it at 0.01.
Let's just have the rest as it is.
Okay, that's better.
That's better.
Of course from this picture we might not
get a good idea because we don't see 
the amplitude of each of these but
it gives you something.
And clearly on the waveform
it's pretty good, much better.
Let's listen to that.
[MUSIC]
Yeah, that's pretty good,
that's pretty good.
Of course, one basic problem is
the frequency resolution and
the time resolution,
this time-frequency compromise.
So let's see if we can get
better frequency resolution.
So these harmonics,
I am sure there are some,
as we can see here,
that are closer together.
These are partials.
They're not harmonic, in fact.
So, some are related harmonically,
because in the resonance of
the instrument emphasizes certain
harmonics, but some are not completely.
So let's try to make it bigger window so
that we can capture partial that
might be closer together.
So for example let's go to 3001 samples.
Quite a bit more.
See what happens.
Okay.
And let's just leave the rest untouch.
And let's compute it.
Okay, interesting.
So we definitely got many more lines.
But looking at the wave form,
it doesn't look too good.
Let's listen to that.
[SOUND] So in fact, if you pay attention,
one of the biggest difference is that
now the attacks are not crisp.
They are kind of a smeared.
We see it also here in the waveform,
that the attacks are not so good.
So okay.
So that was not a good idea.
We might have gained on
frequency resolution.
But we definitely lost in time resolution.
So let's go back to
a number that is, maybe?
let's have 1,000 which
is kind of a compromise.
See what's happening now.
And okay, that's pretty good.
Looking at the waveform
It looks quite decent.
And if we listen to that
[SOUND] Okay it's pretty good.
Even though
if you listen carefully we are still
missing a little bit of the sound.
The sound especially during the attacks.
There is a lot of energy.
There is a lot of noise into 
that maybe with these sinusoids
are not well captured.
But that's one of the things
that we'll talk about and
we'll learn how to handle
in the next few classes.
This is all I wanted to
say in this lecture.
So let's go back to the slides.
So we have done a little bit of more
analysis of a particular sound.
In this case, the Mridangam,
using the sinusoidal model.
And of course, we have used the sms-tools
and sounds from freesound.
Hopefully, this has given you a better
understanding of the sinusoidal model and
at the same time
Maybe you have discovered this
new fascinating instrument,
which is the Mridangam, and which I
encourage you to listen to it and
especially in the context
of Carnatic music.
So this is all and
I will see you next class.
Thank you very much.
