Welcome everyone to this first lecture of
the course on Audio Signal Processing for
music applications.
In this first lecture,
I want to introduce a few practical
things related with the course.
The first one is to introduce ourselves.
Professor Julius Smith, he's a professor
at Stanford University at the Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics, under whom I did
my PhD quite a few years ago.
And from whom I learned most of
the things I know on audio signal processing.
And myself my name is Xavier Serra, and
I teach at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona,
and I lead a research
group in music technology.
And we have two teaching
assistants in the course.
Ajay Srinivasamurthy and Sankalp Gulati.
They are both doing their PhD
under my supervision in Barcelona,
and of course they work on music and
audio technology topics.
Despite these pictures we are definitely
not professional performers, but
we are definitely music lovers.
We love to play and
we love to listen to music.
And the main reason we are in this
topic is because we want, and
we like to develop engineering tools
that can be of relevance to music.
So what is this course about?
Well, it's basically about signal
processing, about audio and music,
about programming techniques that
are relevant to audio and music,
and about understanding and making sounds.
Who is this course for?
Well, it's for anyone interested in
understanding how to analyze and
process musical sounds.
But, you have to be able to
follow mathematical formulations,
use a programming language, and
use sound processing software.
You definitely don't have to
be an engineering student,
but you have to have some
technical background.
The course is ten weeks long, and
every week covers a particular topic,
and every particular topic is presented
through different perspectives.
Through the theory lectures,
we present the more mathematical and
signal processing point of view.
Through the programming lectures,
we present the applied point of view in
which you learn how to implement things.
And finally through the demo
lectures you understand the more
applied point of view, the,
the use of these techniques and
how these techniques can be of
relevance for sound and music.
Then we have some more advanced topics and
references that will allow you to view and
understand other related topics and
every week we'll
have some assignments, specifically some
programming assignments and some quizzes.
In fact the evaluation is done every
week and there is a weekly quiz that
counts five points, and there is a weekly
assignment that counts for 10 points.
And these weekly assignments
are the programming assignments.
And then there's two surveys,
one at the beginning of the course,
one at the end of the course,
that we would like very much you to fill.
So we also give it two points for
filling out the surveys.
One fundamental concept in the course is
that we decided to have everything open.
All the videos, slides, all
the materials that we have created for
the course are available under
creative commons licenses.
Especially the Attribution Noncommercial
share alike license.
All the software,
that we have developed, and
that we use in the course,
is also available freely, under the Affero GPL license.
Most of the references that we use,
if they are not ours, they come from open
repositories, like Wikipedia or
some other related sites.
And we'll be using sounds.
So all the sounds we use come
from freesound.org, which is a,
a website that hosts
creative commons sounds.
In this short lecture we have presented
some practical things related with
the course, there is much more
information in the website.
So please make sure that you understand
the context of the course, and
how the course is run.
Especially before you actually
go deep into the course.
So that's all for today and
I hope to see you in the next lecture.
Thank you.
