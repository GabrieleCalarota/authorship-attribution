Welcome back to the course on Audio Signal
Processing for Music Application.
Last week we introduced
the Discrete Fourier Transform,
but that's not enough, if we really
want to understand it deeper and
if we really want to understand how
it behaves when we deal with sounds.
This is what we'll be doing this week.
In these theory lectures
we'll be introducing the properties
of the Discrete Fourier Transform.
In this first one we will talk about
four properties: linearity, shift,
symmetry and convolution.
So let's start.
Linearity is a very convenient property
of many mathematical operations,
in this case of the DFT.
It basically means that is
a well behaved operation.
If we start with a linear
combination of two signals, x1, x2,
then in the spectral domain, in the
frequency domain, it also corresponds to
the linear combination of the spectrum of
the individual signals that we put in.
And it's very easy to prove.
If we start with the DFT of this sum,
of these two signals, x1, x2.
We can see easily that we can group,
we can separate these
summatory into two sums.
One for a x1, and another for b x2.
So basically we are computing two DFTs,
and
since the scalar values do not depend
on n, we can put them outside the sum
and therefore we will get small
a multiplied by the DFT of X sub 1,
plus b
multiplied by the DFT of X sub 2.
And we can exemplify this
with two real signals.
If we start with a signal x1 that has a
given amplitude and frequency
and another signal x2
which is also sinusoid
with a given amplitude and frequency
we can compute the DFT of
these two signals separate, so
we can see the magnitude spectrum,
the absolute value of signal X1, and
the magnitude spectrum
of the signal X2, and
we can sum the two, so on the left plot
we can see the sum of the
two magnitude spectra.
But if we had to computed the DFT
of the sum of these two sinusoids,
the result would be the same.
So the DFT of
suming the x1 and x2 is the same
than having sum the two DFTs.
And this is basically a result of
the linearity property of the DFT.
Let's go to another property,
the shift one.
Shifting means displacing samples
of a signal,
and in the DFT case,
it means that if we shift the samples in
the time domain signal, we
shift x n by n0 samples,
in the spectral domain it corresponds to
having the spectrum of the signal X
k and
then multiplied by a complex exponential.
And again, it's easy to prove if we start
with the DFT of this shifted signal,
then we can change variables, and
if we change
N minus n sub 0 and
give it the name m,
we can see that then we can
split this complex exponential
into two complex exponentials,
one that is m and
the other which is minus n sub 0,
and therefore then we can see
that we have a DFT of the signal x m, and
it becomes a complete DFT
of just the signal X,
and then we have this complex exponential
that has the n sub 0 value,
that does not depend on m, so it becomes
separate and therefore the result is that
we have this complex exponential
multiplying the spectrum of the signal X.
And we can see an example of that too,
here we see two signals x1, x2,
and one is the shifted
version of the other one, x2
has two samples shifting applied to x1.
By the way this is a sawtooth, one
period of a sawtooth waveform.
And then if we take the DFT of these
two signals
We see that their magnitude spectra,
the absolute value of the
spectra is exactly the same,
there is no difference, and this is
because the complex exponential that
multiplies this spectrum does not
affect the magnitude spectrum.
But the phase spectrum
is definitely different.
We have
two lines that have different slope.
And this is because the multiplication
by the complex exponential in
thE spectrum affects the phase value
But not the magnitude value.
So this is an exemplification of
this shifting property of the DFT.
Now let's talk about symmetry.
And in the DFT we have a whole bunch
of symmetries and that's good,
They're going to be very useful for
many operations that we'll be doing.
So for
example if we start with a real signal,
which is the type of signals
that we'll be dealing with,
then it we take the DFT of
that real signal,
the real part of the complex spectrum
is going to have an even symmetry.
and the imagine part of the spectrum
will have an odd symmetry.
and then if we look at it from
the polar representation of the spectrum,
we will see that the magnitude
spectrum has an even symmetry, and
the phase spectrum has a odd symmetry.
And then we would look at
another type of signal,
a signal that is also real
but at the same time is even,
has even symmetry itself,
the time to make signal,
then if we compute the DFT of that
then we will see that the real part
of the spectrum has an even symmetry
and the imaginary part is all 0s, and
then again if we look at it from
the polar representation, then we see that
the magnitude spectrum has the same even
symmetry on the phase spectrum is all 0s.
And we can see it from this example, in which
we start from a triangle,
a triangle is an even function,
and of course is a real
function in this case.
And we see these symmetries, we see
that the real value of spectrum is even
and the imaginary part is all 0s and
their absolute value is
even and the angle is all 0s.
And we can show these symmetries
also in real signals.
This is the sound of a soprano,
a vocal sound, that we can hear
[MUSIC]
so if we take a fragment of this
voiced sound
we see that the spectrum, in polar coordinates, looking at the magnitude and
and the phase,
can display this symmetry,
the magnitude spectrum
displays this even symmetry,
the right part is exactly the same than the
left partm around 0.
So that's a perfect mirror.
And the phase has this odd symmetry,
which might not be as easy to
visualize, but
clearly we see that the right part
is kind of inverted with respect to the
left part, so this is this odd symmetry.
And to finish I want to talk about
the property that relates with convolution,
so it basically says that if
we convolve two signals in
the time domain, two time domain signals
then in the spectrum domain,
it corresponds to the product of
the two corresponding
spectrum of the two signals.
And again it is quite easy to proof.
It we start from the DFT of this
convolution of these two signals,
and then we put the equation for
the convolution and
we can separate the
variable x sub 1, that just relates with m,
and then x2 which has n and m,
but this second part is basically the
DFT of a shifted signal, of
x2 being shifted.
So as we just explained, the shifted
the operation in the spectral domain
corresponds to the product of
a complex exponential by the spectrum
of the signal.
So here we see X2, the spectrum, and the
complex exponential corresponding to that.
And then, this complex exponential
becomes part of the DFT of this x1,
therefore we have the DFT of x1 and we get
this product of the DFT of the x1 signal
with the DFT of x2 signal.
And, like most properties,
this is a reversible property.
So that means that if we multiply
two signals in the time domain,
it also corresponds to convolving
the two spectrum in the frequency domain.
Let's show these two 
views of this property. For
example if we multiply two signals, and
this is an example of this
multiplication, and the corresponding
convolution in the frequency domain.
So here, we start with two signals, x1, x2.
We have the DFT of these two, only
we're showing the magnitude
spectrum, and we see clearly the magnitude
spectrum of these two signals.
These are even and real functions,
so we see these even
symmetries, and then
this spectrum can be
convolved, so
if we convolve these two spectra,
we see these on the right hand, this is
the convolution of these two spectra
Which results into this shape.
But the same shape can be obtained
by multiplying the two signals.
Multiplying x1 by x2,
and then taking the DFT.
The result is exactly the same.
And we can show another example,
which is very common in filtering.
This an example of filtering
a sound, in this case
a sound of the ocean,
by an impulse response.
But first let's hear the two
signals, [SOUND] okay,
so this is an ocean sound, so
it's a very noisy type of signal.
And then we can hear the impulse [SOUND]
It's a tiny sound, it's an impulse
response of of a space and
we can then convolve the two
to get the filtering operation.
This is the standard thing, but
in the context of the DFT
we can see the DFT of
the ocean sound x1 and
the DFT of the second sound x2 and then
this idea of convolution can be done
by multiplying these two spectra.
So on the right-hand bottom we can see
the product of these two spectra.
And on the left hand, we see the DFT on
the convolution on the two input signals.
Okay, so
basically that means that filtering can be
accomplished both in the time
domain by convolving two signals,
or in the frequency domain by
multiplying the two spectra.
And that's quite a very convenient
property that
we can take advantage of the DFT.
Okay.
So, you can find
quite a bit of information about
these things in Wikipedia, and
especially in Julius website.
There's a very detailed explanation of
all these properties and the proofs.
The sounds
come from Freesound and
of course all this is available
under all these open licenses.
So this is all for the today,
in order to understand the DFT in
more real situations we have gone
through some of its properties,
in the second part of this lecture we
will continue with some more properties.
So I hope to see you then.
Thank you for your attention.
