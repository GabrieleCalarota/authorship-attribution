Hello, welcome back to the course,
Analyzing or
Processing for Music Applications.
This week,
we're talking about sound transformations.
In the theory lectures,
we went over some of the models that
we have been talking about this course.
In the context of how they can
be used to manipulate sounds.
So now, in these, demonstration classes,
I want to use some tools.
Mainly the SMS tools.
To try to understand these transformations
from a practical point of view.
In this class, I want to go over the,
the idea of morphing using
the Short-Time Fourier Transform.
So we'll be morphing two sounds.
We will be morphing the sound of the ocean
sound we've been listening quite a bit.
And the sound of male speech that
we also have been listening to.
And using the STFT to
combine them in some way.
Okay, so lets start first trying
to understand these sounds.
We will use the SMS tool's GUI,
the analysis model one.
And we will start with
the Short-Time Fourier Transform and
we'll first analyze the ocean sound.
Okay?
This is going to be the sound
we're going to be taking as X1,
as sort of the basic sound.
On top of which, we will be
putting kind of the speech sound.
So this is the basic sound.
And it's a sound that mainly we
use all the phase spectrum for.
And we will be combining the magnitude
spectrum together with the speech.
So the detail is not so important.
Here, we are worrying about
the general spectral characteristics.
So the window does not
have to be that big.
So for example, 512, it's okay.
There is no need to really zero padding,
and there is no need for
zero face windowing, so
odd-sized window is no problem.
On the hamming window it's, it's good.
Hamming window will be able
to overlap nicely to 50% or
it's nice, it's a simple window.
And the hop size, this is important
to be quite small hop size, so
that we preserve the time
information of this ocean sound.
So let's use maybe 128, okay?
So now we will compute.
well, we're not going to see much because
basically we're just going to see the,
the spectrum of this very
noisy type of signal.
But clearly,
we see this wave type of shape.
And of course,
these random type phases and of course,
the record searching will be the same.
Anyway, so let's, well just start
with this type of parameters.
And now,
we will also analyze this speech sound.
So, we'll take the speech and male sound.
And we're going to we don't have
to use the same parameters.
The hop size will be the same because we
will have to be morphing frame by frame.
The window size can be larger.
But again, since we're only going to take
the overall shape there's no need for
frequency resolution to define the,
the harmonics of the sound or
have the detail of frequency resolution.
That we would need if we wanted
to detect the harmonics.
So maybe let's just use these.
Okay, so clearly this in the,
the magnitude spectrogram,
we see very nicely the time information.
We see very nicely the shape
of the spectrum, you know?
So here basically is the,
the foreman of the sound.
And different vowels that, we, hear.
So they're,
we see this kind of red shapes.
And of course,
we don't see the individual harmonics.
But it's, it's not a problem.
We don't want to detect them for
this particular type of transformation.
Okay.
Okay, so
let's start with these twp sounds and
these parameters.
And now, we will go to
the the transformation's interface.
So we go to the SMS tools software
transformation interface directory.
And in here is where all the code for for
the transformation is and
the, the control code.
And there is a main file that is
an interface which is
called Transformations GUI.
So we can execute that.
And that will open the interface for
the transformations we have implemented so
far.
Okay, so here we have these
different transformations.
And we'll focus on this STFT morphing.
And by default in fact we have the, the
sounds that we were talking about, okay,
the ocean sound, and
the speech male sound.
So let's set the parameters as we
talked in the previous analysis.
So let's use the hamming window,
let's use 512 as the window size,
let's use the same FFT size.
And let's use the half size of 128.
And now for the speech, again,
let's use hamming window.
And let's use the same parameters.
Okay.
Now, we'll have to choose the parameters
for the actual morphing.
And there is basically two parameters.
One is the Smooth factor
of the second sound.
Okay?
So we're going to be applying the speech
sound on top of the ocean sound.
But before applying it,
we're going to smooth it,
so that it just captures
the general characteristics.
These values go from zero to one, so
where zero has to be bigger than zero.
And one is always moving, so that means
that we just capture the 512 sample.
Well, half of that because
we're only going to do,
do the positive spectrum, so 256.
But you can review that, so
by default here it says 0.5.
So lets leave it with 0.5.
And then we have a Balance factor,
which is a factor which will say how much
of each spectrum we're going to take.
If we take zero it means it's
going to be close to the ocean sound.
In fact, if we zero it,
it's just the ocean sound.
And if it's one, it's going to be
basically the full magnitude spectrum,
the smooth magnitude
spectrum of the speech.
So let's just take quite
a bit of the speech.
Let's put for example,
0.8, Let's apply it.
Okay, so here is the result.
We see the input sound x, the ocean sound.
Then the magnitude spectrum
of the ocean sound.
And this is the morph spectrum.
So this is already the, the combination
of the magnitude spectrum of
the ocean with the smooth
spectrum of the speech.
Clearly, we see quite
a bit of the speech shape.
But we also see the granularity
of some of the ocean sounds.
And, this is the synthesized.
Let's hear the synthesized sound.
>> Do you hear me?
They don't lie at all.
>> So we definitely understand and
hear very clearly the speech sound.
We will hear the pitch of it because the
pitch we don't, we have not tracked it.
And the phase, in fact,
where a lot of the pitch information is in
the phase spectrum is
the one of the ocean sound.
So we hear like a whispering type of sound
and a kind of a little bit of the ocean.
In order to hear more of the ocean,
we can just reduce the balance.
So for example lets put 0.2.
These will take lets say 20% of the speech
sound, and 80% of the ocean sound.
Definitely now from the spectrogram,
we can see that it's much
closer to the ocean sound.
In fact,
it's very close to the ocean sound.
But, if we listen to it.
[SOUND] Interestingly enough,
since we already have
heard the speech sound,
hearing these sound, we,
we hear the, the and, and
understand the speech sound.
Even though we if I bet that if we would
have heard these for the first time,
we would not have understood the,
this speech utterance at all.
Anyway, so feel free to play around with
these things and with the parameters.
And I think quite a lot of
different nuances can be obtained.
Of course, we could extend these
application to have more sophisticated
controls of where this kind of
interpolation or morphing parameters.
But anyway, with this I believe
it's a good interface to get
an understanding of the potential of
this type of of tools and of techniques.
Okay, so that's all I wanted to say.
So basically we have used the SMS tools.
first, the analysis to understand the,
the spectrum of these two
signals that we wanted to morph.
And then we introduced the,
the Transformations interface that
have we have in the SMS tools.
And we have used the SMS more STFT
morph interface to morph this two
sounds that I've for sound this ocean
sound and and the speech sound.
So that's all.
That was the first demonstration class.
We have seen the,
the potential of the STFT for morphing.
Now in the next classes, we will go
to the, the Sinusoidal model and
to the Harmonic, Non-Sinusoidal, and
Stochastic to experiment with
other types of transformations.
So I hope to see you next class.
Bye-bye
