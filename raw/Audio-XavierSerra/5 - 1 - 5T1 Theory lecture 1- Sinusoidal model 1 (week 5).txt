Welcome again to the course on Audio
Signal Processing for Music Applications.
Last week we talked about
the Short-Time Fourier Transfer.
That offered a sound
representation from which we
can synthesize sounds without
losing any information.
And at the same time it's a good tool for
understanding, describing and
transforming sound.
This week, we go a step further in
the direction of obtaining a higher level
representation, that in exchange
of losing a bit in terms of
the identity properties of the STFT,
we gain quite a lot of flexibility, and
level of abstraction in the representation.
This is what we call the Sinusoidal model.
And we'll cover this topic
in three theory lectures.
So this is the first one.
You will first present
the model, the Sinusoidal model.
And then talk about how these sinusoids
can be expressed in the spectrum and
how can they be identified in
what we call spectral peaks.
So the model is quite simple; it's
just a sum of time varying sinusoids.
So this equation, we have seen it before.
But here we are emphasizing two aspects.
One is the idea of summing
a finite of number of sinusoids,
capital R, so we have capital R sinusoids.
And each of these
sinusoids is time varying.
It has an instantaneous and
a frequency value that changes in time.
So it changes as a function
of the time index N.
But, we're interested in modeling
the sinusoids in the frequency domain,
in the spectrum.
So let's see how that looks like.
Again, we have seen
these equations before.
So if we start from signal x,
that is a real sine wave, and
then we take the DFT of the windowed
version of this sinewave.
We see that, of course, the sinewave
can be expressed as the sum of two
complex sinewaves, that are then
multiplied by the window we use.
And, being the sum of
two exponential sinewaves,
we can split that into two sumatories,
separate DFTs.
So we'll have a DFT of
the negative frequency and
a DFT of the positive frequency.
Each one, again
multiplyed by a window and
these complex exponentials
can be grouped together and
basically this is the DFT of a shifted
version of the transform of the window.
Okay so
basically, at the end we see that the first
summatory is the DFT of the function W,
it's a big W, and the frequency
index is shifted.
So we have shifted 
the window, and is scaled by
the amplitude of the cosine, by half
of the amplitude of the cosine.
And the other element is the
the same window but
shifted by the positive frequency and
also scaled by the same amplitude.
So if we start from a sinewave, and
we want to show it, the plot
of one single spectrum of this windowed
sinusoid, we can see it like this.
So this is the positive spectrum, so
we don't see the two windows,
we only see the positive one.
So we're seeing the positive
frequencies and so
the contribution
of the positive exponential.
And we see the shape of the window that
we used but
of course centered at
the frequency of the sinusoid,
which is 440 hertz which of course
we can listen to the sine wave.
[SOUND] And this is its spectrum,
so a peak centered at 440 hertz and
the phase, that during
the main-lobe is flat,
that corresponds to the phase of
that sinewave at location zero.
Let's make it a little bit more difficult.
What happens when our sound
is made up of two sinewaves.
So these are two sinewaves,
one at 440 hertz,
the other at 490 hertz, together, and
we can also listen to that [SOUND].
Okay so,
clearly it sounds like a modulated signal.
And in the time domain
we can see these modulations.
We see the low frequency, which is like
the modulation, and the high frequency.
And if we compute the spectrum of that,
the positive part of that,
we are seeing the two contributions
of the two sinusoids, so
see the two peaks of the two sinusoids.
And in the phase we see the phases
of these two sinusoids.
And now let's show an example
of a real sound, a sound that
includes many sinewaves,
like the sound of an oboe.
Let's listen to the oboe first.
[SOUND] Okay, so this is an oboe playing,
the A4 note so
which is around,
fundamental around 440 hertz,
and in the spectrum we
clearly see all these
sinusoids which
are the harmonics of the sound.
Here we are only plotting
the first 4,000 hertz.
So, we're only seeing
the first few harmonics,
this sound has many more harmonics.
But this a good way to zoom into 
these shapes of the windows and
also we see the phase spectrum of that.
But, how do we detect the frequency,
amplitude and
phase of each of the sinewaves?
A simple way to identify
a sinusoid in the spectrum is by
just focusing on the spectral magnitude,
on its location and on its height.
So the location is the frequency and the
height is the amplitude of the sinusoid.
So, therefore, we consider a sinusoid
as a peak in the magnitude spectrum.
And, of course, the issue is that 
the resolution of a magnitude spectrum is
is discrete, is finite, and the maximum
resolution we'll be able to get
is half of the distance between two
frequency samples, between two bins.
So, that's the maximum frequency
resolution that we'll get in
measuring a sinusoid.
But we can do better than that.
And, a way to do better than that, and
related to things that we have already
mentioned, is the idea of zero-padding and
of spectral interpolation.
So we'll be able to do zero-padding to get
a bigger FFT, so that we get more samples.
And we can also do interpolation
directly on the resulting samples to
even refine the value of the frequency and
amplitude values.
To detect the spectral peaks we have
to understand the effect of the window and
the most important factor
is the window size.
So, if we have a particular window, and
one important concept is the bandwidth
of the main-lobe in the spectral domain.
So the bandwidth of
the main-lobe is B sub f, expressed 
Hertz, so that would be the main-lobe
bandwidth of a window in Hertz.
And that's defined as
the product of B sub s, so
the main-lobe width of
the window expressed in samples,
multiplied by the sampling-rate and
divided by the window size.
So that would be the width of
the main-lobe, and then if we consider
a particular delta, of the distance between
two frequencies that we want to resolve,
so we have two frequencies
f sub k plus 1 and f sub k.
So the absolute value of the difference
is the delta frequency
that we want to resolve.
So what would be the window size,
capital M, so
that two main-lobes of
the window are disjoint; so
that we can see these two frequencies
as separate peaks in the spectrum.
So this equation here
shows what has to happen.
So M has to be bigger or
equal than B sub s, so the number
of samples of the window, 
in the main-lobe, multiplied by the
sampling rate and divided by this delta.
Or, we can also
change this delta as the absolute value of
the difference of these two frequencies.
But, in many cases this difference
between the two frequencies corresponds
to the fundamental frequency, because if
it's a harmonic sound the distance between
two consecutive harmonics is equal
to the fundamental frequency.
So if we consider the fundamental
frequency this delta that we want to be
able to discriminate, then
the bandwidth in hertz of the main-lobe
of the window has to be smaller or
equal than this fundamental frequency.
So, we see these lobes separate.
And therefore, capital M, the window size,
will have to be bigger or
equal than B sub s multiplied
by f sub s divided by f sub 0.
Or if we express the period instead of
the fundamental frequency,
we express the
the cycle length as the period in samples,
then this M has to be big or equal than
B sub s, multiplied by the period.
And the period of the harmonic sound
expressed in samples;
which is this capital P.
So let's show an example,
let's start from a given window, like
the Hamming window,
that B sub s is equal to 4.
So the main-lobe width is equal to 4 and
we have a given sampling rate,
And we have two particular frequencies
that we want to distinguish, the ones we
showed before, 440 hertz and
490 hertz, so the difference is 50 hertz so
we can calculate capital M that allows
us to distinguish these two frequencies.
So capital M will have to be bigger or
equal than B sub s,
4, multiplied by sampling rate, 44,100, and
divided
by this difference, the absolute value of
this difference, which is going to be this
50 hertz, and
that M will be 3,528 samples.
So if we take 3,528 samples of this signal and
we compute the DFT of,
with some zero padding so
that we see a smooth spectrum,
we see this magnitude spectrum.
Clearly, we see two
clearly distinct peaks.
each one corresponding to
the transform of a Hamming window, and
of course in the phase spectrum we
also see the corresponding phases.
And let's see what happens
with different sounds.
So, for example, if we have
the sound of an oboe, that has
a particular frequency, which is
440 hertz, 
what should be the M, so
if we take an M of 401 samples,
these 401 samples basically correspond to
four periods of this oboe sound, okay?
And then, so, if we compute
the DFT of this signal,
multiplied by a Hamming window, and
again with zero-padding to get N
equal to 1024, we see these
harmonics quite clearly separated,
so each harmonic corresponds to
one main-lobe of this Hamming window and
they're quite clearly one after the other.
But now, let's see if we increase this
window size, instead
of having this 401 sample,
we have twice as many,
so we have 801 samples, and
then we do the same thing,
we apply the Hamming window and
then we take the FFT which is larger,
we see this spectrum.
And so here
because we took more samples, the
the distance that now we
can discriminate is larger.
So in fact, we see that the main-lobes
are narrower than what we even need,
that is, we even see the side-lobes
in between the two main-lobes,
because we took a bigger window size and
therefore we are able to discriminate
even more than the fundamental frequency.
On the topics covered until now there
are quite bit of references but
starting from this lecture on
the techniques are more specific
to music applications and
quite a bit less has been published.
This is good for me, for
the course, you have to pay more attention
to what I'm going to be talking about.
Anyway, so,
apart from the standard references
in Wikipedia, you can find,
a little bit about it.
And of course, again, on Julius
references you can find,
quite a bit more, a more in depth
discussion about these things.
And that's all for this lecture.
We have presented the Sinusoidal Model; a
sound representation that can be built on
top of the Short-Time Fourier Transform.
And that can reduce the amount of
the spectral information to be considered.
However to use it we have to understand
a bit about spectra and about windows.
Hopefully, you understood
some of that in this lecture.
Now we have to complete the explanation
of how to identify the spectral peaks and
how to synthesize them, so this will be
covered in the next two theory lectures.
So, thanks for your attention.
