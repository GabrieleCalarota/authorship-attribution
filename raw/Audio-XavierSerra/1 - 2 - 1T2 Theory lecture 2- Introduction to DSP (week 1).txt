Welcome everyone, to the course on audio
signal processing for music applications.
This is an introductory class
to audio signal processing.
In this lecture, we will introduce
the concept of audio signal processing and
then go over some common music
applications of signal processing.
In particular, we will mention storage,
data compression, effects and
transformations, synthesis,
and description.
This should give you a flavor
of the potential of the field.
We first have to define the terms.
So, how do we define
audio signal processing?
And we could say in in simple terms,
that it's an engineering field,
that focuses on the computational methods
for intentionally, altering a sound.
In this block diagram we see a waveform,
a sound.
Going through an audio
signal processing system.
That is control with some device,
or with, by a person.
And then it generates another signal,
a modified version of the original signal
That can be a waveform or
it can be, any other type of signal.
Since audio signals, sounds,
maybe be electronically represented
either in digital or analogue formats.
Signal processing may
occur in either the main.
Analogue processors operate
directly on the electrical signal.
While digital processors
operate mathematically on
the binary representation of that signal.
An analogue sound, is usually electrical.
A voltage level representing
air pressure of the wave form.
It's a continuous function,
like the one shown on the top plot.
On the other hand,
a digital representation, expresses
the pressure wave form as binary numbers.
Thus, as a discrete function,
like the one shown, in this bottom plot.
The digital representation permits
the use of microprocessors and computer.
And although the conversion from analogue
to digital can be prone to loss,
most modern audio systems,
use this approach.
Because the techniques of digital signal
processing, are much more powerful and
efficient that the ones
based on analog techniques.
Now let's start going through
some common applications,
of the audio signal processing techniques.
One such application,
is the storage of sound.
And as the recording and reproduction.
The digital representation of sound waves,
such as spoken voice, environmental sounds
or music, can be recorded as electrical or
mechanical inscriptions in the media and
can then be recreated
from these inscriptions.
So the well-known CD shown
in this picture is a media,
that stores digital
representation of of sound,
as a mechanical inscription on the media.
And therefore from it, we can reproduce
the, the sound that was recorded.
Another signal processing
application is data compression.
Or also called, audio coding.
The goal here is to reduce the bandwidth
requirements of the digital audio stream,
and the storage size of audio files.
There are two types of
compression techniques.
The ones called lossless, with which
you do not lose any information, and
the ones that we call lossy.
Some information is lost, but
hopefully, the information lost
is not perceptually relevant.
So, in this in this diagram,
we see a digital representation of a,
of a sound which is a WAV
file format that then
can be coded, using for
example a perceptual coder.
And convert it into a much smaller,
more compact representation like
the mp3 files which are using this
lossy representation, this lossy,
coding that we just mentioned.
A number of the basic
techniques that we will cover,
are very much behind audio
compression systems.
A large group of applications relate
to performing sound transformations.
These type of applications
are used in post production and
in musically created usages.
For example in these two plots,
what we are seeing,
is two typical transformations.
They come for a software audacity
that we'll be using in class.
The one, the,
the first one is a compressor.
So what it does it that it
reduces the range, the dynamic
range by compressing some some frequencies
or some components of the signal.
And that's very much used to optimize the,
dynamic range of the digital domain.
And the other is reverberation.
Which is very common to effect
that is applied to sounds that
might be recorded in a studio or
in a dry environment, and then,
we want to recreate the big space, or
a space in which the sound was produced.
But there are many, other type of
transformations that we could talk about.
For example, we can talk about echo,
equalizer, flanger, phaser, chorus pitch
shift, time stretching, voice effects,
3D audio effects, morphing, and many more.
And again, we will be doing
some of this in this course.
And we will explain some
specific techniques.
One of the traditional uses of signal
processing, is related to sound synthesis.
That's with the aim to generate sounds.
Either, by imitating existing sounds or
for creating new timbers.
So here we show three block diagrams of
three commonly used synthesis approaches.
One is subtractive synthesis, in which we
start from a rich complex sound, and using
filters we extract or take out components
to obtain some interesting sound.
Another type of algorithm,
is the FM synthesis which is based on,
modulating one oscillator by another.
And finally we have the diagram
of additive synthesis,
which is a technique
that is based on adding,
basic oscillators, basic signals,
typically sine waves.
And therefore, we could using or
recreating, a complex sound
from basic components.
And there are many others common
other common techniques could be
granular synthesis,
physical modeling, wave shaping.
Sampling, spectral synthesis, these are,
techniques that are used either
commercially or in in academic
experimental situations quite a bit.
We will develop and use some of
these techniques, in our course.
Especially additive and
subtractive synthesis.
The last group of applications,
that I want to mention,
are related to sound description.
Techniques for analyzing audio signals,
with the goal to describe and
model meaningful
characteristics of the sound.
This is a topic, that has expanded
enormously in the last few years.
And it is very relevant in
the field of information retrieval.
Here we see a block diagram, of an
algorithm that is able to extract the key,
what we also call like
the chords of a musical signal,
from an audio signal,
going through different steps.
We are able to identify if it's
a C-major fragment, or A-minor,
or some other key that
the piece of music might have.
And these type of descriptions
can be grouped into,
different levels, of abstraction.
So we can talk about the low
level type of descriptors,
that relate very much to the signal and
we can mention loudness, timber, or pitch.
Or you can talk about more musical
level type of descriptions and
talk about the rhythm, the harmony, or
the melody of a given audio fragment.
And finally, we can talk about
high level type of descriptions.
And and refer to like the genre
of a piece of music, or
the emotion that a piece
of music might carry.
Or the idea of how similar a piece
of music is to another one.
The automatic description of sounds,
will be an important application of
the topics covered in this course.
We'll not be able to go over
the extraction of mid and
high level features of a signal.
But the discussions that we will have
on the analysis of low level features,
at the, are at the basis of the general
topic of sound and music description.
And this is all for, applications.
So a good overview for
what I just mention,
is the Wikipedia entry on,
audio signal processing.
All the software that'll we be
use in class is open source.
Like the program audacity,
that I refer to.
And that I have the link here.
And all the slides and code that I am
going to be using are released and
their CC Attribution
Noncommercial-Share Alike.
So it's open license type type model.
And the code that I will be
using is also released under GPL,
the Affero GPL license.
You can get all the slides and all the
codes we'll be using from this website.
And these are for the lecture.
I tried to give you a brief overview
of what audio signal processing is.
Giving examples of some application areas.
Hopefully, this has motivated you
to continue in the course and
that is worth the effort that
you will have to dedicate to it.
So, I'll see you next class.
Thank you.
