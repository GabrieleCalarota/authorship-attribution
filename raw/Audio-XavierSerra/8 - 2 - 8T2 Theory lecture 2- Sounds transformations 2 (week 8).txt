Welcome back to the course on audio signal
processing for music application.
In the previous theory lecture we started
talking about sound transformations,
in particular about how to use
the short time Fourier transform and
the sinusoidal model
to manipulate sounds.
In this second theory lecture
I want to continue that and talk about
the harmonic plus residual model and
how it can be used for transforming
the frequencies of the harmonics, and
then the harmonic plus stochastic model,
and how it can be used for
time stretching and morphing operations.
This morphing, by the way, is
quite different from the one
that was possible with
the short time Fourier transform.
And of course these are just some example
operations, example transformations, but
the number of possible usages
of these models is much larger.
Let's start with the harmonic
plus residual model.
This is the block diagram that
we have seen before,
in which, from the input sound
we analyze the spectrum, find the peaks,
and then find the fundamental frequency,
find the harmonics,
and we subtract
those harmonics from the original signal.
We need to compute
the spectrum of the original signal
again in order to develop a spectrum from
which we can subtract these harmonics and
subtract these harmonics in a proper way.
Okay, and then where we do the
transformation is in the frequencies and
amplitudes of the harmonics, we don't
apply any transformations to the residual.
In order 
to apply transformation to the residual
it makes sense to have a model for it.
And that's what we're going
to be introducing in the next
model; the harmonic plus stochastic model.
And here the transformations
on the harmonics, again like in
the sinusoidal model, it's applied
only on the frequencies and amplitudes.
The phases are forgotten, we don't use them,
we will be resynthesizing them
again after transformation.
And the main issue of that is
because the phases are very
sensitive to transformations.
And it's very difficult to handle them,
so it's better to just regenerate them,
after transformation and
it doesn't sound that bad.
Anyway, so
after the transformations we can
sum these new harmonics
to the residual signal.
And this residual signal, since it
does not include any deterministic,
any harmonic information,
it will merge quite nicely.
And then it will create a sound
that has the same residual
than the original
And the harmonics will be modified.
In terms of types of transformations
that can be done to these harmonics,
the frequency of these harmonics,
there are many.
And here I explain three common ones.
The most traditional one is to just
transpose all the frequencies by
a given factor.
So, we multiply all the harmonics
by a scaling frequency factor, so
that would correspond to a transposition,
so if we've multiplied by two
it would correspond to converting
the sound to an octave higher.
If we multiplied by 0.5,
it would be an octave lower.
Okay, then we can, instead of multiplying,
we can just shift all the frequencies.
For example, we can sum a factor
to all the frequencies.
So, we'll be shifting all the harmonics
by an additive component.
And finally,
the last one I want to mention is what is
called frequency stretching.
In which we are applaying frequency change
that is dependent on the harmonic.
So, here what we are doing is basically
dividing every harmonic by it's
harmonic number.
So we basically get a frequency
around the fundamental, and
then we multiple by the harmonic number
to the power of a scaling factor.
Therefore,
the higher harmonics will be modified very
differently from the lower harmonics.
It's very much harmonic dependent
and that can create some nice
effects that we will see.
So this is
a plot of these three transformations that
exemplify these operations quite nicely.
So on the top left we have
the original harmonics, all located at
at the harmony number location,
one, two, three, four, and five.
Then if we transpose by two, on the right,
it just simply multiply every one by two so
harmonic one will be in position two,
harmonic two in position four, etcetera.
We are maintaining a harmonic spectrum.
We are just transposing by a factor of two.
If we shift instead by an even value,
in this case since we are 
having the frequencies
normalized to integer values,
gere by 0.5 will be basically shifting by
half of the frequency of the first
fundamental, of the first harmonic.
And in here we see that we're shifting
everything by a constant value.
So, from now, after this transformation,
we do not have any more a harmonic series.
Because the first harmonic is not just
the fundamental frequency anymore.
Okay?
So we have now a series of values
that are equally spaced but
they are multiples of another frequency,
so
the sound may be quite a bit different,
and quite interesting in some cases.
And finally,
the frequency stretching operation.
It's a quite different operation.
Now, it changes
the distance between the harmonics and
it's like an accordion.
You know?
So, if it's here 1.3 it
means that well the first value,
the fundamental, will not be touched.
The first one will be stretched
by a factor of 1.3 and
these are going to be powers of this.
So as we go higher up,
it's going to go sort, the distance
will increase kind of exponentially.
And this creates again quite
very interesting effects.
So let's listen to a sound in which
we have applied some stretch and
transpose kind of transformation.
So let's listen.
it's a flute sound that we can listen to.
[SOUND] Okay.
It's an A4 and below that we
see the harmonics that I have
identified on top of the residual
spectrum of the original signal.
And then what we are doing
is leaving the residual as it is,
the background spectrogram is
exactly the same than the top one.
And we're just modifying the harmonics.
So, if you look here the harmonics
have been heavily modified and
if you see there have been a stretched and
at the same time transposed a little bit.
So let's listen to
that modified sound.
[SOUND] Okay,
of course, quite different.
And if you pay attention, the residual is
there and since the residual is basically
this breath noise, it merges also quite
well with these transposed harmonics.
Okay, let's go to the other model,
the harmonic plus stochastic model.
It's very similar to the previous one.
And now the transformation is applied both
in the modeling of the residual signal,
and of course in the harmonic components.
So we have an stochastic approximation,
and therefore we
can transform that quite easily,
because it's a model that has simplified
the residual quite a bit and it's
quite flexible in terms of manipulations.
And then of course after transformation
we obtain the stochastic component and
we obtain the frequency,
amplitudes, and phases of the
harmonics sinusoids and we can synthesize
the two, and summing together.
So in terms of what is actually done is
very similar to what we presented for
the sinusoidal model.
Now what we're introducing
is the transformation on
the stochastic component in a similar way.
So the frequencies of the harmonics
can be scaled by a factor.
And the time of the reading
of this frequency values
can also be changed in order to
obtain this time scaling operation.
So we have this scaling function.
The amplitudes is the same way and
the stochastic component
is handled in the same way.
Okay, and
of course the phases are generated.
And they are generated by starting from
an initial phase and then adding 
the frequency of every harmonic that
we want to generate to that phase,
So we can generate instantaneous
phase that way.
Okay, let's show an example of that.
This is the sax phrase that 
we have heard before, let's
listen to that again.
[SOUND] Okay, and then we have the analysis of it,
where we have analyze the harmonics and
the stochastic component,
and then we can change that.
In this particular case we have done time
scaling, so we have changed the timing and
now with the residual
approximated with stochastic
it's very easy to do time
scaling of the stochastic and
the harmonics, and and that's it.
We have just focused on the time scaling
transformation in this particular example.
Let's listen to that very
simple time scaling operation.
[MUSIC]
So basically the only thing we have done is we
have compressed the first part
of the signal by quite a bit.
And in fact it's like
half of the duration, and
the second half has been
extended by twice as much.
So in fact the overall
duration of the sound
remains the same.
Of course, as you can imagine,
this is very flexible and
we can do a lot of kind of envelopes
that we can play around with.
Okay, now, let's talk about the morphing
using this harmonic plus stochastic model.
Okay here we have simplified
the block diagram.
We have two sounds x1 and x2.
Now they are basically at the same level,
and
basically what we're going to do is
interpolate the two representations.
So from x1 we obtain the frequencies and
amplitudes of
the harmonics and the stochastic
approximation of the residual.
On of sound 2 we do the same thing.
And then what we're doing is
interpolating these 2 sets of functions.
We're interpolating the frequencies,
the magnitudes, of the harmonics.
And we're interpolating the stochastic
envelopes of the residual.
And then of course we can synthesize
back the output sound
by generating the stochastic component and
the sinusoidal component.
Let's look at a particular
frame of a sound in
which we have applied
like a 50% interpolation.
So on top left is x1,
one particular frame, the
harmonics visualized as
the location in the frequency and
height is the amplitude, okay?
And then the blue one is sound 1.
x2 the red one is a sound too.
Okay and then we can interpolate this too,
basically harmonic by
harmonic we can interpolate.
And as you see the x2
it's a different frequency,
it's a sound that has a higher pitch.
So the interpolated result has a pitch,
which is in between the two and has a shape,
again, that is in between the two, okay?
So, it's basically a 50% interpolation
between the two sets of values, and
the stochastic component below is,
that's the same idea,
So, on x1, this shape is
the approximation of the residual,
is very clear that the crosses is
actually where we have values,
as an envelope, and
x2 is another envelope for x2.
And the output is
the interpolated envelope.
So, it's a shape that's in
between these two shapes.
Okay, let's use that in a particular
example in which we start from a violin
sound and we're going to interpolate it
progressively towards a soprano sound.
So here we see, on the top, the violin
sound and you can listen to.
[SOUND] Okay, and it's analyzed, so we see the
harmonics, well we see, I think here, is
the first forty harmonics, and
then the stochastic component of that.
And then we see below the analysis of
the soprano sound, listen to this.
[SOUND] Okay where we see again
the harmonics, it's a higher pitch.
And the stochastic component
in the background.
And now we can choose
the interpolation values to
go from one set of values to the other.
So it will progressively go
from one sound to the other.
Let's listen to the result.
[SOUND] Of course, since one,
the soprano sound, is higher than
the violin, we hear this glissandi.
But at the same time,
we hear the evolution of the timbre.
And every single parameter is slowly
changing from one to another.
Again, the possible type of functions
to control these interpolations is
enormous so we can play around
quite a bit with these ideas.
And that's all, so again in wikipedia
there is not much and there's not much
that we can refer to in terms of
trying to understand some of
these transformation aspects.
And in fact a lot of these
things is just by trying.
So I would encourage you
to try these things and
develop your own intuition of what
it works and what it doesn't.
And that's all.
So this has been the second theory
lecture on sound transformations.
Of course in this week, what is
important is the programming and
the demonstration classes even
more than the theory lectures.
Because after all it's a very applied
topic, and it has to be grasped
from a application and from
an an intuition and musical prospective.
So thank you very much for your attention.
I'll see you in the next lecture.
Buh bye.
