Hello.
Welcome to the fourth week
of the course on audio signal processing for music applications.
And in this demonstration class I want to
continue what we started in the last one,
which was to analyze a sound,
in that case, a sound of a soprano,
using the Short Time Fourier Transform,
the topic of this week.
So in this lecture
I want to analyze another sound.
A sound that can give us another view
of the Short-Time Fourier Transform.
So let's open the SonicVisualizer and
this is the sound we are
going to analyze today.
And this is the sound of a piano.
And so let's let's listen that.
[MUSIC]
Okay, so this is a very simple piano
phrase, quite clear, five notes.
So let's go directly to the sms-tools and
let's go to
the Short Time Fourier Transform model.
So let's go to the piano sound.
is here, piano.wav.
Okay.
And now let's decide about the parameters.
Okay, in the last class we mentioned that
the Blackman was quite a good choice for
what we were doing, so let's keep it.
The window size, okay,
this is not as high pitch as the
as the voice so
we would need quite a bigger window size.
So, I don't know, let's start with for
example, let's say 1501.
This is an odd size window and
this is something that we will,
whenever possible, we will do.
If we take windows with an odd
size that means that they can be
centered around zero and especially for
the phase analysis,
that's going to be very convenient.
So let's now use that and
let's take that as a habit of
using always odd sized windows.
The FFT has to bigger than that.
And of course, normally now we will
be always be using power of two, so
that is efficient and
you can use the FFT algorithm.
So the power of two
bigger than 1500 is 2048.
Okay?
That's a good size.
On the hope-size has to be,
for the Blackman window,
has to be hop so
the windows overlap correctly.
So let's say, they have to be,
at least, one fourth of 1,500,
so that would be around, let's say 325.
okay.
That would be around one fourth.
And let's compute.
Okay.
This was the input sound,
the magnitude and
phase spectrogram and
the output reconstructed.
So let's first just listen
to the reconstruction.
[MUSIC]
Okay, that's pretty good.
So, I guess we haven't lost any
information from the analysis so
that means that the hop size and
the window size were chosen correctly, so
that they overlap correctly.
And well, in the phase spectrum we
see it looks like very minimalist,
but it's quite interesting.
We see this very clear vertical lines.
And this corresponds to the attacks,
basically,
this means that during these attacks,
the phase is quite disrupted.
It's quite changed.
There is a quite big transition there.
That's something that we see
very clearly in the phase information.
And in the more steady, during the notes,
we see more of these horizontal structure.
That means that the harmonics maintain
a kind of a phase continuity,
that can be identified in
the phase spectrogram.
In the magnitude spectrogram, we see well,
we see very clearly the harmonics.
These red lines and we see that, as
the sound evolves, piano being
a percussive instrument, in the attack
there is more energy, and so
there is more harmonics, and
as the time evolves,
the harmonics are decaying and
especially they decay, the high harmonics,
and the low harmonics, are staying more.
We also see quite clearly,
the attacks of the sounds and what
is going on during the attacks, so
that's that's quite interesting.
Okay, now let's, zoom in and
let's go into some detail of that.
So let's use the option of this figure
of doing zooming into rectangle.
And let's just take this middle note,
the fourth note,
from a little bit before the attack
to around when the note ends, okay.
And that's that's what we're getting.
And what we're seeing in fact is
the discretization of the analysis.
We have zoomed enough, so
that we can see this vertical kind of
quantization, these vertical bars.
This corresponds to every frame,
every spectrum, computed.
So, at every bar correspond to
the number of samples of the hop size.
So this was these 325 samples, that we
are hopping from one frame to the next.
And vertically, we also see this kind of
discretization, these horizontal lines.
That are are more narrower,
because we have taken quite
a bit of samples in the FFT.
We have taken 2048 samples.
So that's, we have a pretty
good frequency resolution.
Let's compute with a different
set of parameters.
For example,
let's use a window size which is smaller.
For example, let's use 201 samples.
And let's use an FFT size
correspondingly smaller.
It does not have to be that big,
so let's say 256.
And of course
the hop size has to be accordingly to
the window size, at least one 4th.
So let's use 50.
And now, lets compute it.
Okay, it takes a little bit because
its of course, being the hop size smaller,
it has to compute more FFT's.
And this is the what we get.
Basically we, we're visualizing
a similar thing, the analysis and
then the synthesis, and
the synthesis is going to be pretty good.
Let's listen to that.
[MUSIC]
Since we have maintained the same
relationship between the hop size and
the window size,.
The identity is preserved.
So, the output sound is
identical to the original.
But now let's zoom in to the same
region that we zoomed before,
to try to understand the differences.
Let's get a little bit before the attack,
and
let's get a little bit
of the steady state.
Okay.
And let's compare it
with the previous one.
Okay, this was the previous and
this is this one.
Well, quite different.
If we mention what we were talking about
before, the concept of the vertical and
horizontal lines, in terms of
the vertical lines we see them narrower.
There are more frames per second here.
So, the resolution,
the time resolution, is bigger.
Okay?
So we see more things, in terms of what
how things evolve in time.
In exchange, at the vertical axis,
the frequency resolution,
is worse,
because the FFT-size was much smaller.
Therefore, these boxes are kind of
larger in the vertical axis.
So, we see less information 
in the frequency resolution domain.
And this is at the core of one of
the things that are fundamental for
the Short-Time Fourier Transform, is what
we call the Time Frequency compromise.
In the first case,
we had a good frequency resolution and
a not so good, time resolution.
In exchange, in this second example,
we have a pretty good time resolution,
but not so good frequency resolution.
And that's a quite important
consideration to take into account
when we analyze the sound, and to decide,
what is the best set of parameters for
a particular sound.
Okay.
Now, let's go into one
aspect, to the attack, and
try to understand some aspect
of this sound by looking at
this find spectrum analyses
that we have started to do.
So let's, for that, let's do the DFT.
Okay we will just compute
the DFT of one location at the attack.
Okay?
The attack, more of less it was around,
let's see, it was 1.54.
That's kind of where the attack is.
And let's keep this same
resolution that we have.
So let's keep the 1501 and
let's have the FFT size 2048.
And let's use the piano sound.
Okay, now, we will compute it.
Okay.
This is the beginning and
we see here is
the attack of the piano.
So we see quite a bit of
things going on here.
The phase and the reconstruction.
Let's zoom into the beginning.
So, let's just get magnitude
spectrogram up to,
let's say,
well let's get up to 10,000 Hertz.
Okay.
So we see quite a bit of things.
Let's now recompute 
with the same parameters, but
a little bit beyond the attack.
So when more is a steady state.
So let's say
100 milliseconds after,
so 1 second and
64, with the same parameters.
Okay.
And this is another analysis.
And let's again zoom into the same region.
Let's just zoom into the region that goes
until 10,000 hertz.
And that we get all the information.
Okay.
And let's compare it, and
let's see if we can understand what is
is going on,
what is going on at the sound level.
All right.
This was, the top is the attack,
the bottom is the more steady state.
In the time domain clearly,
we see the difference.
In the frequency domain I believe we
can see also significantly difference.
For example in the attack,
the harmonics are not so well defined.
Because it's the beginning of the sound
the harmonics have not
been started completely.
Instead, in the steady state, these peaks
are much more clear, much more resolved.
Okay?
Then another thing,
is that, in the attack,
kind of the noise floor, basically the
energy or the high frequencies, is higher.
So the high frequencies are much louder,
than or at least substantially louder than
during the stead state, in which, are the
lower harmonics are clearly louder.
Okay, so this is a good way to try
to understand a particular sound,
a particular fragment of a sound 
and do some analysis using
the Short Time Fourier Transform that
gives us some insight into the sound.
Okay.
So that's basically all I wanted to say.
So we have been looking at the
at a sound,
in this case the piano sound,
using the sms-tools, and of course,
this sound is available on the freesound.
And hopefully this has given
you another insight into the
the tool we are building.
In this case,
the Short Time Fourier Transform.
But at the same time has given you
some insight into the piano sounds.
And I believe itâ€™s a quite
interesting instrument and sound.
And using these tools
we can appreciate quite a bit of it.
So anyway, so that's it for 
the demonstrations of this week.
So, I hope to see you next class.
Thank you.
