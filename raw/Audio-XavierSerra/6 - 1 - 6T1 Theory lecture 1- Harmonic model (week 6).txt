If you're watching this, it hopefully
means that you have followed the course on
audio signal
processing for music applications until here.
You've just reached the half point,
so congratulations.
And no need now to give up,
very interesting topics are still coming.
Last week we talked about
the sinusoidal model.
And now, following in the path
towards a more flexible and
higher level representation of sounds,
we present the Harmonic Model.
We will first introduce the actual model,
then talk about the difference between
sinusoids, partials, and harmonics.
Then discuss the difference between
polyphonic and monophonic signals.
Then present the idea of how to detect these
harmonics from sound, given that we
know from the fundamental frequency, which is
going to be a topic of the next lecture.
And then, we'll put it together
into an analysis synthesis system,
the harmonic model system.
So the equation of the harmonic
model is very close to the one of
the sinusoidal model,
that we already explained, there is
a single but very significant difference.
The frequencies of the sinusoids are all
multiples of a fundamental frequency.
Thus, it's only valid for single
source sounds produced by periodic or
pseudo-periodic oscillations like the sound
produced by many musical instruments.
So if we look at the equation,
well the output signal yh,
where we emphasize the idea that
is a harmonic signal, with the h,
that is of course the index n,
is a sum of
our cosine functions, time varying,
with a time varying amplitude and time
varying frequency, but here the frequency
is not f sub r, where would allow
any frequency for any sinusoid.
but is r f sub zero.
So that means that they are all
multiples of f sub zero.
Small r is an integer value.
So it means that all the sinusoids
are either, for different values of r,
either the fundamental frequency or
any of its multiples.
We can also express the model
in the frequency domain,
the time varying spectrum
of a harmonic sound
is the sum of all the time-varying
spectra of the harmonics.
So in this case
we are expressing the idea of a sinusoid
being the transform of the window.
that we use in analysis.
So the spectrum,
the overall harmonic spectrum, is the sum
of all these windows which are a scaling
factor of an amplitude A and
a shifting factor of minus rf, in which
we are placing these windows at
the appropriate location of the sinusoid.
Okay, this is basically what we
talked about in the sinusoidal model.
But now again here,
restricting the frequencies to be
multiples of the fundamental frequency.
Here we show spectrograms
of the sinusoidal
tracks of two sounds that have
different characteristics.
The top sound is an inharmonic
sound, a note of a vibraphone, and
the bottom plot, is a harmonic sound,
a voice singing mainly a vowel.
Let's listen to top one,
which is this vibraphone sound.
[SOUND].
Okay, this is a very simple sound but
it has lines that are non-harmonic.
So, that means they're 
not multiples of a fundamental frequency.
Some are related, in fact we listen
a pitch in this note, but there
is some of the sinusoids that are clearly
not perfect multiples of this fundamental.
Instead, the second sound,
which is a voice sound, which varies, so
it's a bit more complex.
[MUSIC]

Okay, so this is the sound of Vignesh singing,
and here we see that
the lines, the sinusoidal lines, are very
much multiples of the fundamental.
They're multiples, in fact,
of the first line.
And this is the typical
structure of a harmonic sound.
In order to better understand
the concept of harmonics,
is important to understand the difference
between sinusoids, partials and harmonics.
Many people get confused with that.
Sinusoids is a mathematical function.
It is a function that we
compute from an equation.
And that is it has
an analytical representation,
and therefore comes from
a mathematical point of view.
So, the top plot is clearly
the spectrum of two of such
mathematical functions, sinusoids that we
have computed with the sine function.
A partial instead, is a component
of a signal that is periodic and
stable and that can be modeled,
as a slowly time varying sinusoid.
Okay?
So here we
introduce the concept of a real sound.
A partial is a concept that comes
from analyzing a real signal.
That has a certain behavior,
that can be approached, can be
modeled, with these mathematical
concepts that is the sinusoidal function.
Okay?
So this,
second plot is a one spectrum
of the vibraphone, in which
we see that there are several of
these components in the spectrum,
that can be approached, or can be
modeled, with the idea of a sinusoid.
Others not.
So, in here, clearly there is some
very clear sinusoidal components and
some other aspect of the spectrum,
which might be, is not so
easily model with the idea of sinusoids.
And finally, a harmonic
is a partial of a sound.
There is a multiple of
a fundamental of frequency.
So it can also be modeled as a 
slowly time during sinusoid.
But it has this added restriction, that
has to be a multiple of a given frequency.
So in this last plot,
that is the oboe sound,
We see this very, the peaks,
the top peaks, these crosses, these
are clearly the multiples of the first
peak, which is the fundamental frequency.
But there are other crosses,
which are not harmonic.
They're not multiples of
this fundamental frequency.
These are, maybe, artifacts.
Or maybe part of some
signal that is underneath.
Or maybe, some side lobe.
And looking at the phase
spectra of the same signals,
it also helps to understand
that some of these concepts.
So the top 1 is the phase
of these two sinusoids.
We see this very flat area in
the main lobes of the two sine waves.
In the second plot,
with vibraphone sound,
with clearly some areas that
are quite flat, where the cross is.
And that, so hopefully means that
they are kind of sinusodal,
And some other crosses
are not in a stable region, a
phase region,
So that means that maybe they are not sinusoids.
And finally, on the oboe
sound, we see the same thing.
Some of the crosses
are clearly in the flat region.
And this clearly means that
it is a stable component.
So it's a flat phase stable component, and
some of the crosses,
are not in such areas.
So that might give some indication that
they are not sinusoidal, or
that they cannot be modeled
easily as sinusoidal components.
In order to use the harmonic model,
we need to identify the sound
sources that are harmonic.
In the case of a polyphonic signal
there are several sound sources.
For example, there might be several
instruments playing at the same time, and
some might be harmonic, some maybe not.
So for example, this top plot is
the fragment of carnatic music concert,
in which we hear a voice and
some accompanying instrument.
Let's listen to that.
[MUSIC]
So, the goal would be to identify
the harmonics of the voice sound, and
looking at these sinusoidal tracks.
Well, it maybe not that easy but
still, it can be done.
We can try to track the harmonics
off this voice sound, or
other harmonic components
that might be present.
A monophonic signal,
includes just one single source.
Source like the one of below which is just
a single voice that we already heard.
So, it's Vignesh
[MUSIC]
So, so he is in fact the same singer
than the voice above, but
clearly here,
we can see the time varying harmonics
much easier, and these
the sinosoidal tracks that we
have identified can show very clearly
the harmonics of the voice.
So the question is, how do I identify
the harmonics of a sound source, being
in a monophonic signal, or
in a polyphonic signal?
We are just focusing on harmonic sounds.
So, we would like to find the harmonics
in a monophonic signal, or
in one of the sound sources
of a polyphonic signal.
The major problem is the
identification of the fundamental
frequency of a sound source, and
this will be covered in the next lecture.
So, here, we will just assume that we know
the fundamental frequency of the sound.
So we'll focus on the concept
of a harmonic and
we will define that as
being a spectral peak,
whose frequency is close to a multiple
of the fundamental frequency.
And we can formulate this idea with
this equation in which we define f p a peak,
The concept of it being a harmonic,
will be when the absolute
value of the difference between f sub p and
a multiple of f sub 0 for
a given frame l, is smaller than
a threshold that we give.
And at the same time we define this
idea of being stable as having been
lived for some time,
as having been in existence for some time.
So, we also make the restriction
that this f sub h has
has had some existence for some number
of frames before the current frame.
So we could define a capital L, as the
number of frames, the minimum number of
frames, that we need to have in order for
a harmonic to be defined as a harmonic.
The implementation of the harmonic model,
is a modification of the sinusoidal
model that we saw last week.
Here we introduce two modules, one is
the F0 detection algorithm, that again
requires to be treated separately,
and we will discuss in the next lecture.
And the idea of the harmonic detection,
which was what we talked about,
the idea that we select the peaks that
are harmonic of the fundamental frequency.
And the rest is exactly the same
than the sinusodal model.
So letâ€™s, this is an example of an analysis
synthesis of the sinusodal model,
And that was the Vignesh sound.
The harmonics of that, of course,
that always might have
some problems in the areas in which
we don't have a clear harmonic,
like in the transitions,
in this case even in the
consonants, or silences
we might have some problems.
But in general it works, so from
this sound that we already heard
[MUSIC]
This is the synthesized sound,
which is quite close to the original one.
So, for this sound,
the harmonic model works quite well.
The concept of harmonic oscillations, in
the study of many natural phenomenon are,
is quite present 
in many books and references.
And you will be able to find them, in
Wikipedia you can find many of that.
Of course that is not much when we deal
with specific music signals and sounds,
and the harmonicity of sounds.
But still, you will find some
things on Wikipedia 
and on some books, and
again the sounds you have heard,
that I played come from freesound.
And you can find all these, the code for
these plots, that I showed
in the in the GitHub repository.
So we have covered the harmonic model.
So you can use it to analyze and
synthesize signals.
The application possibilities we
will see that are much larger than
with the sinusoidal model.
And we'll show some examples of that.
The difficult step is the detection
of the fundamental frequency and
that's what we will cover
in the next lecture.
So see you in the next class.
