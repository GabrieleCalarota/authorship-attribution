Hello.
Welcome to the course on Audio Signal
Processing For Music Applications.
This week we're talking about quite
a few spectral modelling approaches.
We are combining the sinusoidal and
harmonic analysis that we
talked in the last few weeks
with the idea of residual and stochastic
approximation of this residual.
So in this demonstration class I want
to talk about one particular model,
the harmonic plus residual model.
So the idea of analyzing
the harmonics of a sound,
subtracting them from the original
signal and obtaining the residual.
Which then can be combined of course with
the harmonics that we have identified.
So let's use the sms-tools that
we have been talking about
and developing in the course.
So let's start with the DFT and
let's start with a sound,
with this organ sound that we
have in the sms-tools directory.
Let's listen to that and
we'll listen with headphones so
that we can listen more carefully.
[SOUND] Okay, this is a quite
very stable tone and
it's a very traditional,
a standard sound of an organ.
so in order to analyze
we want to be able to
distinguish the harmonics of this sound.
So, this is a C3,
which is around 264 hertz.
So in order to find what
is a good window size.
Well let's use the Blackman Window,
this is a very stable note so
we can take advantage
of a longer window and
really try to isolate
the harmonics as much as possible.
So that's six bins for 
the Blackman Window and
then samplig rate 44,100.
And then we divide by
the frequency of this note,
264.
So that gives me 1002 samples
that makes sense to analyse.
Okay, so let's put 1003 to make it an odd window.
And okay.
Let's use 2048 FFT size.
So with quite a bit of
zero padding, that's good.
And so let's compute it.
Okay.
So
this is the samples that
we are analyzing.
We are analyzing six periods of the sound.
It clearly looks very sinusoidal and
from the magnitude spectrum
we see that there's not
that many clear harmonics.
Even thought there is quite a bit of
energy in the high frequency range.
but it doesn't have all
these clear sinusoids.
So this is an indication that it's
a sound that has quite a bit of
kind of noise like or a kind of
a stochastic component into that.
Well the phase looks as expected and of
course the reconstruction is quite good.
Okay, so
this looks like a decent approach.
Of course we could maybe,
given that it is stable,
we could take a bigger window size,
so let's try that.
Let's try like twice as much.
Let's try 2,006
samples and then let's even
do a bigger FFT, let's use it 4096.
Okay, so we're doing
quite a bit of 0 padding.
And well here
the time was in 2 second; so
which is good the,
the delay sound is quite long.
So we're kind of in the middle.
So let's do that.
Okay, this looks like
twice as many samples,
like we are analysing like 12 periods.
And yes now we are seeing a little
bit more things in the spectrum,
if we compare
the previous one to the current one,
we are seeing the harmonics maybe more
defined, and we're seeing quite
a bit of background things, so
maybe now we have seen a little bit higher
harmonics than we were seeing before.
Because with the higher window,
we kind of reduce this background,
because it's not a very
coherent type of signal.
So, it emphasizes the coherent part,
the harmonics, and reduces
this kind of stochastic component.
Okay.
So this seems to be a good choice.
So let's go to the STFT and
apply the same parameters.
So let's apply the Blackman, but let's
first open the sound, the organ sound.
Let's use this 2006 samples.
That we took.
Okay.
And let's use the 4096 FFT size.
here, now we have to choose a hop size.
well, here I don't think
it matters that much.
But let's just use maybe 500, so
one fourth
to be able to overlap the window Blackman.
In fact it should be even more,
but for efficiency purposes
let's just leave it like that.
Okay, let's compute this.
These will take a little bit longer
because it's a longer sound and
it is quite big.
Okay, so this is what we're getting.
Of course, the resynthesized,
we do not need to listen to it because
it's going to be quite identical.
And now well we see
the horizontal line, 
maybe let's zoom into the lower areas.
Okay and so that we can see
a little bit better the harmonics.
The harmonics look clearly
very well defined.
But there is quite a few
things in between.
Okay, that seems to be a good choice.
Now let's do the harmonic analysis.
Again, using the same parameters.
So it will go to the organ,
let's see, the Blackman,
Let's use the 2006, and
let's use 4096 as the FFT site.
And now we have to choose a parameter to
identify the peaks and the harmonics.
The magnitude threshold, okay minus 90,
that looks like a reasonable one.
The duration of the harmonics
here, since we're in a long stable note,
We can even afford to put longer
type of tracks, these let's say
that they have to last for
0.2 seconds, so it could be even more,
the number of harmonics, the truth is not
that many, because they kind of disappear.
So I would say that with 30 or
40 harmonics should be plenty.
And we know the fundamental
frequency, 264,
the range has to be for that.
So, 130 and 300, 264 is within that.
So, maybe we can even make this higher so
that it makes sure that it fits correctly.
Okay, that sounds good.
And this is the error
for the frequency detection.
It should be a very clear fundamental.
There should not be a problem with that.
And this deviation.
This is how we will allow the harmonics
to deviate from perfect harmonicity.
So, let's leave it like this and
see what happens.
Okay.
Let's compute it.
Again this will take a little bit longer.
OK, so we found quite a few harmonics.
And, of course in the attack
and decay is very unstable so
maybe we should have rejected those.
But what is interesting
is that some harmonics
are quite stable, but
some are very unstable.
Let's listen to the re-synthesized sound.
[SOUND]
Okay.
It sounds good.
Let's compare with the original.
[SOUND]
Well if you pay attention,
clearly the original has this more
air in the background that is not in
the synthesized, because it's
mainly the harmonics.
But the truth is that, also some of these
higher harmonics are very unstable.
So, may it's not right to consider
them as harmonics because they
are basically maybe
tracking some noise part.
So one way to get rid of that is to reduce
this deviation and restrict it even more.
For example, let's put 0.001.
And then let's see what happens.
Okay.
Now, it got rid of some of these partials.
But maybe an even better way to do that is
to make sure that they are long enough.
So, instead of having 0.2,
let's make sure that, okay,
that the harmonics should be at
least 1 second to be considered.
Okay. Now we got
rid of quite a lot of this higher,
unstable either harmonics or components.
Let's listen to this synthesized sound.
[SOUND] Yeah, that sounds quite clean and
definitely, of course,
not as rich as the original sound.
[SOUND] Okay, now we can go with these
same parameters to the harmonic plus residual
so to subtract these harmonics
from the original signal.
So let's use the same sound.
Let's use the, 2006 window size, 4096.
This threshold was minus 90.
The minimum duration of track.
I think we put .4,
we put, I know, we put 1 second.
So okay, so 1 second, number of
harmonics, now definitely we can put less,
We can even put just 30.
And here we have to make sure it was
within that, so let's say 130 to 350,
so that is within that for sure,
we'll find it, no problem.
And the error, I don't think this
matters to much, but here we put 00,
I think that's two zeros, okay.
We'll leave it like that.
Okay, let's now compute this.
Okay, this is what we got, and let's see.
So here we see the harmonics it found,
the black lines, and the background
spectrogram is the residual.
And we can listen to
the different components.
So we can listen, well,
just the sinsusoids, the harmonics.
We already heard that.
Let's listen to the residual.
[SOUND] Yeah, that's a very
clear and nice sound.
That is what was missing
from this harmonic sound.
[SOUND] So
clearly if we put these two sounds
together they will sound
like the original.
[SOUND] Compared with
the original.
[SOUND] Yeah
that's an identity, basically.
So this was a good sound
to explore the potential of
the harmonic plus residual.
Of course if we take time varying
sounds that may be a little bit more
tricky and we will have to tune
the parameters a little bit more, but
with that, I think you get an idea of
what the harmonic plus residual model and
the tool within the sms-tools
that implements this model, what it can do.
So I encourage you to play around,
of course,
choose other sounds maybe more complex,
sounds that change in time.
So we have talked about
the Harmonic plus residual model,
and this is one instance
of the models that
we are talking about this week. On
the next demonstration lecture.
I want to talk about the harmonic plus
a stochastic model so that we can model
the residual that we just heard as an
stochastic signal and see what it can do.
So, I will see you next lecture.
Thank you.
