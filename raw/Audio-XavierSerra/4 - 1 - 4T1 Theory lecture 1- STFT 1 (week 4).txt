Welcome back to the course on Audio 
Signal Processing for Music Applications.
Until now we have seen how to compute
the spectrum of a signal, its DTF.
But real sounds can not be
represented by a single spectrum.
Sounds change in time, and
we need to capture this time variation.
The short-time Fourier
transform is our solution.
Again, this lecture is
divided into two parts.
So this is the first one.
We'll first present and explain
the short-time Fourier transform equation.
And then discuss,
what we call the analysis window.
The is the short-time
Fourier transform equation.
Basically, a modified version of the DFT.
With few but important differences.
So for example, the input to the equation,
the input signal
is not just x of n, but
is the multiplication of
w, which is our analysis window, by
a fragment of x of n.
So here, x is has an argument, that has n,
our time in that.
But also has a frame number and
a hop size.
So, l is the frame number and
this is our time in that.
So we will be
iterating over l, so
we will be skipping over time this way.
And capital H is our hop size,
how much we're going to hop from
one time instance to the next.
So basically,
x is going to be changing in time
according to l and H and
then at every time instance, at every l,
it's going to be multiplied by
this analysis window w of n.
The rest is the DFT.
So the only thing that changes is that
the input signal
changes.
And therefore, the output also
is not a single spectrum, but
a sequence of spectra.
There is the, X sub l, so the
the variable l is the frame number.
So that means that the output of
the short-time Fourier transform is
going to be a sequence of spectra.
Each one of the same size and
having magnitude and phase.
But, each one different because the input
will be a different fragment of the sound.
Stepping through the sound
in a progressive manner.
So, to emphasize the idea of zero phase
windowing, that we already have talked about,
from now on we generally
specify the time index to go
from minus N over 2 to N over 2 minus 1.
Okay, so it's always centered around 0.
We don't have any phase changes,
we don't have any
kind of shifting in the time and
therefore in the spectrum.
The windowing is a way to step through
the sound, as I mentioned.
So, here we can see 
a depiction of that.
And if we use the analogy of image and
video, we coud relate a spectrum
with a photograph, a static image,
and then the short-time Fourier transform
with video, a time varying image.
So, here we see in this picture,
the whole time for
for a sound at the bottom and
how we are basically
stepping through the sound by windowing
the sound with this analysis window.
And therefore being able to get all the
sound as a sum of sound fragments.
Okay, to better understand the effect
of windowing a sound let's put an example
of what happens when we window a real
sinusoid and then compute its spectrum.
So we start from a real sinusoid,
sinusoid we already have seen that.
So it's a cosine with 
a frequency index k sub 0,
and an amplitude, a sub 0, which can be
expressed as the sum of two complex
sinusoids, one with a positive frequency
and another with a negative frequency.
Then if we substitute
into the short time Fourier
transform equation this signal and
we window it, we can step through
these different steps in which
we first put x of n in the
equation.
Then we are substituting the sum
of these two complex exponentials.
Therefore, because of the linearity of
the DFT, we can split these into two
equal equations
in which in each one we have
a complex exponential as the input signal,
and the amplitudes
can be moved outside and
basically what we get back to.
Is the sum of two DFTs of the window and
with frequency shifting operation.
So basically and the end here we see that
the result is the spectrum of the window,
of course, frequency shifted by
the frequency of the input signal,
and multiplied by the amplitude, by half
of the amplitude, of the input signal.
Plus, of course, the other window at
the other complex exponential frequency.
One is the minus frequency and
the other is the plus frequency.
So this will be the result
of this cosine so
which is basically the transform
of the window shifted to the frequency
of the input signal and multiplied by 
the amplitude of the input signal.
Well with this plot we can understand
this windowing process a little better.
So on the top we have the window,
and underneath is the windowed
sinusoid that we have
as our input signal,
and then the transform of
the window can be shown on the top,
in which the transform of this window,
which, in this case is a hanning window,
is the magnetic spectrum
centered around zero,
and with the symmetry and
with the even phase.
And now if we take the DFT
of the windowed sinusoid well,
what we are saying is basically
the same shape than the window,
but at the frequency of the sinusoid,
the two frequencies of the sinusoid,
the positive and
the negative frequencies.
And at the phase of the sinusoid too.
So we have the two values for
the two phases with these
anti-symmetry that is analysis results into.
So for this discussion we can
realize the importance of the analysis
window in the spectrum of a sinusoid and
thus of any sound.
It's clear that we have to spend
some time explaining the windows.
So an analysis window
is generally a real function
and is symmetric around the origin,
and this is the simplest window,
the rectangular window.
It's time domain is
nothing too particular, but
it's magnitude spectrum
is much more interesting.
So time domain it has value of
one for the duration of the window,
in this case 64, and
the spectrum, the magnitude spectrum,
has a shape which we call it
is a sinc shape, because the
the transform is a sinc function.
And it basically could be described
in many different ways but
we focus on two main aspects.
On what we call, the main lobe,
the peak at the center,
and we'll be talking about
the width of the main-lobe mainly.
And then, we talk about the
side-lobes, which are these
small lobes next to it.
And we basically focus on the level
of the highest of these side-lobes.
So we will be talking about
the highest side-lobe level.
And okay, so there are many
windows used in audio signal processing and
this is the list of windows available
in the SciPy module of Python.
So we can go through them and
we can see quite are a variety of windows.
Some of them we're not
going to pay much attention to but
for example we will be talking
about the Blackman window,
we will be talking about the Hamming
window, the Hanning window.
We will be talking about
the Triangular window etc.
Some others are not so much used in audio.
Each window can be distinguished from
the others by measuring the main lobe
width and the side lobe level
and each window offers a different
compromise with respect to these
two values.
So, let's show some of them.
So
the first one is the rectangular window.
And the equation shows
how it's computed.
And the spectrum is what
we call a sinc function.
Is the sine pi k, where k is
the the frequency index divided by
another sine function.
So if you look in the plots
the spectrum could be thought,
well is the magnitude spectrum,
so is the absolute value of this W k.
So basically, is a sine
function with kind of attenuated
function applied to them,
at the boundaries.
So it results into
this shape, very characteristic shape,
that's going to
called sinc, function.
And talking about how to describe
it we mentioned about the
width of the main lobe and
this has two bins, and
two bins means two samples, and
this we have to be careful because this
is measured when the DFT is
the same size than the window.
So if we take a window size of
the same size of the window,
lets say ten samples,
then its going to be two bins.
But generally since we do zero padding,
then the number of bins is higher.
But this is because of the zero padding.
And we normally do it
in order to better visualize the shape.
So in fact this shape, has been
generated by a lot of zero padding.
So that we can
have this smooth visualization.
But strictly speaking, the number of
bins that we refer to is two.
And the side lobe level, the higher
side-lobe level, is minus 13.3 dB.
So the distance between the center
peak and the first side-lobe level.
Maybe, the most popular
window is the Hanning window,
which is a raised cosine.
So the equation is .5
plus .5 of the cosine,
this raises the cosine, so
it's just one cycle of a cosine.
And if we compute the spectrum
it also can be expressed as
sums of the sync functions.
In fact all the windows can be expressed,
in the time domain by sums of cosines and
in the frequency domain by
sums of this sinc function.
So in this case is the sum, in the
frequency domain of three sinc functions.
And, again the two values that
characterize this shape, this frequency
domain's shape, is the width of
the main-lobe, which is four bins.
So, twice as much as
a rectangular function.
And, the side-lobe level is
minus 31.5 decibels, so which is lower.
Okay.
Now the main lobe is wider and
the side lobe level is is lower.
The Hamming window is very similar
to the Hanning but with a small and
significant difference.
It's a raised cosine with a step 
at the side.
By having these small steps
into the sides we get
a magnitude spectrum that maintains
the same main-lobe width, so
that's good, it doesn't
get wider.
But, in exchange, we get
much lower side-lobe level.
Minus 42.7 decibels.
And this is,
as we going to see, an important thing.
The ideal is to have
the lowest side-lobe level
and the narrowest possible main-lobe.
So, this is a good window.
Of course, nothing comes for free,
so the side-lobe level
do not decrease so abruptly, as they go
away from the main lobe.
The Blackman window is the sum of
two sinusoids, and with that
we accomplish a significant improvement
in terms of the side lobe level measure.
Okay, so we see the magnitude spectrum,
which the main lobe
is wider, is 6 bins,
but the side-lobe level is lower,
is -58 dB.
And that's good because
that's starting to be
quite useful value at the side-lobe
level for many audio applications.
we will come back to that.
And then finally
the window I want to end talking
about is the Blackman-Harris window
which is a very special one,
because we can basically say
that it has no side lobes.
So, it's a sum of several cosines,
in this case is four cosines.
with different coefficients
in the summing.
And then in the frequency domain,
the magnitude spectrum,
the main lobe, again, gets wider.
In this case, it's eight bins.
But, the side-lobe level is minus 92 dB.
And if we think about it in
terms of signal to noise ratio,
which is a very important factor in
digital, signals, 92 decibels is basically
below the noise floor of 16 bits, of
the kind of signals that we deal with.
So basically that means that these
side-lobes, and if we consider them as
artifacts or as noise,
they are not heard.
In other windows we could say that
these side lobes are artifacts that
can't be heard and
again we will come back to that.
And now to finish let me just
compare some of these windows
being applied to the same sound.
So we start with a fragment of a sound,
of a certain length,
and we are applying
three different windows.
The first one is rectangular,
the next one hamming,
and the finally the Blackman.
Clearly, very distinct spectra.
And by looking at these we can see

that maybe the best for
this particular analysis is the Blackman.
We see a smoother spectrum.
We see these peaks are
much more clearly distinct.
And in fact these peaks correspond
to the harmonics of the sound.
Okay, so this is all and there are a lot
of references for the topics I covered.
Especially about Windows.
In Wikipedia you can find quite a bit
of information about the short time Fourier
transform, about Windows.
Julius, in his website and in his online
books discusses this quite a bit, so
that's a very good reference.
And the rest are the standard
credits and references.
So this is all for
the first part of the lecture
on the short-time Fourier transform.
We have explained the basic equation
of the short-time Fourier transform and
we have focused on the analysis window.
In the second part
we will continue with this topic.
I will see you in next class.
