Welcome back to the course on audio
signal processing for music applications.
We are in the second
week of the course and
this is the second part of the lecture
on the Discrete Fourier Transform.
In the first part,
we focus on the basic equation of the DFT.
So now let's continue.
We will briefly review the DFT equation,
and then we will talk about how the DFT
works when our input signal is a complex
sinusoid, or when it's a real sinusoid.
And then we will talk
about the inverse DFT.
So the DFT can be understood
as the projection of
a signal into a finite set
of complex sine waves.
Thus, it is able to identify how much of
each of these sinusoids is present in
the signal.
So from the equation, the concept of
the inner project expresses this idea.
That, the signal x of n when we
project it on the complex sinusoids
e to the minus j 2 pi kn over capital N.
We are basically measuring
the amount of the sinusoidal signal.
If we show an example this,
this violin sound so
we are taking a fragment of this sound.
[SOUND] Okay, so we are taking capital
N samples of this violin sound and
we're projecting it.
Into these complex sinusoids
that we are generating and
the result is this spectrum
expressed in polar coordinates, so
we see the magnitude and
the phase spectrum.
In the magnitude we see the amount
of each of the sinusoids present.
In the, the signal, and
in the phase we are identifying
the location of these sinusoids
with respect to time 0.
So if we plan how to compute the DFT
of one single complex sinusoid,
we'll understand this
concept a little bit better.
So, let's start from a,
an input signal, x sub 1,
as which is defined as a complex sinusoid.
Of length capital N.
And has a given frequency
expressed by this index, K sub 0.
And what we going to do is,
we going to substitute our input signal x,
in our DFT equation.
By this complex sinusioid.
So therefore we have a product
of two complex sinusoids.
We can sum the exponents and
we obtain a single complex sinusoid.
With a more complex exponent.
And this in fact is the sum
of a geometric series, and
therefore it has a closed form that
can be expressed by this equation.
And by basically inspecting
this equation we can see that
when K is not equal to K sub 0.
That the denominator is not 0.
And that the numerator is 0.
Therefore all the,
the output signal, X of K.
Is equal to capital N when
k is equal to k sub zero.
And is equal to 0 for the rest.
So what we're saying is that it has
a single value at k equal k sub zero and
this value is N.
So let's see the plot of this operation.
So this is the DFT of a complex sinusoid.
So on top we see this complex sinusoid,
that k is equal to 7.
So basically means that it has seven
periods in the length of captical N in this case
We have defined capital N as 64.
So there's seven periods
in the 64 samples.
And of course we see the cosine and
the sine.
And when we compute the DFT,
again we see the magnitude and the phase.
The phase are messy so
let's not talk about that right now,
let's just focus on the magnitude.
And here we see clearly.
The value of 64 at one location,
which is at location k equals 7.
The rest of the values are 0.
However, this is a very
special case in which
the complex sinusoid is one of
the basis functions of the DFT.
This never happens when
dealing with real signals.
Let's see a more realistic example.
The DFT of a complex
sinusoid of any frequency.
Let's start with a signal x of 2.
In which is a complex exponential but,
the frequency is not,
one of the frequencies
of the DFT sinusoid, so
the frequency is expressed by f sub
zero and it has an initial phase.
And it has the same duration,
say it has the duration of capital N, but
it doesn't have let's say, a fixed
number of periods in that duration.
So anyway, so let's put these
sinusoid into the DFT equation, and
we again get the product of two complex
exponentials, we can sum the exponents
except that the phase term
of the sinusoid can be.
Pull outside,
because it does not depend on N.
And also being a geometric series,
we can have a closed form.
But it's not so easy.
It's not as nice as the previous one.
It doesn't have fixed values
that are clearly identified.
So let's see a plot of this operation and
how this function looks like.
This shows the display of what is
the DFT of a complex sinusoid that
doesn't have a discrete frequency.
It's not as nice as the previous case.
So in here we have taken k equals 7.5.
So a frequency that is
not an integer value.
And, capital N is 64.
So here means that we do
not have an integer number of
periods within the 64 samples.
In fact we have 7.5 periods.
And when we compute the DFT,
the first thing that we notice is that
the magnitude spectrum has
positive values for all k.
Of course, there is one area that has, a
prominence, and it's the area around 7.5.
In fact, for k equals 7 and
k equals 8 has the same value.
And for the rest of K,
has a much smaller value.
The phase,
let's not talk much about it here.
It's not that relevant for
this, this situation.
Okay but even this is not that real.
We do not encounter complex sinusoids
like these in our physical life.
So let's go a step further and compute the
DFT of a real sinusoid, not a complex one.
That's something that is closer
to the reality of sound.
But it's a bit more messy.
So let's take a signal
that is a real sinusoid
with a frequency that is
an integer value frequency.
So by using the Euler's
identity that we talked about.
We can express this cosine as
the sum of two complex sinusoids.
And if we plug this
real sinusoid in the DFT.
And then we express it as the sum
as the two complex sinusoids,
we basically can do the same operation
that we did in the previous case,
being the DFT a linear function and
we will talk about that,
we basically can express the DFT of
this sum of two complex sinusoids.
Ask the sum of two DFTs of
each sinusoids separately.
Therefore, the result is
basically two DFTs that would
basically have seen one is of
a frequency of negative frequency.
And the other is the DFT of
a frequency of positive frequency.
And with a given amplitude, each one.
So what the result basically we go through
the logic that we did before is that
it's going to have an amplitude A sub zero
over two for two frequency locations.
For the frequency location of k sub 0.
And for a frequency location
of minus k sub 0, and
it will have 0 for the rest of k,
and let's see plot for it.
Okay.
So, this shows the output of calculating
the DFT of a real sinusoid, but.
We have complicated it a little bit more,
and
we have not expressed it for
k equal to an integer value but
again, for a k being a floating
point value, in this case 7.5.
So it would take the real signal, and
take the DFT of that,
we will see that it has two bounds.
One around minus 7.5 and
the other around 7.5.
And again it has possible values for
all k.
Okay however still we do not find
sinusoids like these in our daily life.
But we're getting quite close.
Some sounds are not that different
from real sinusoid like this one.
So, one of the great properties of
the DFT is that it is invertible.
Which means that we can get back
the original signal from its, spectrum.
So this is the equation
of the inverse DFT,
in which our input signal now is
a spectrum, is capital X of k.
And then,
we do a similar operation like the DFT.
We multiply by complex exponentials,
but in this case.
Is not a, a negative, exponential,
is a positive exponential.
Because we're not taking the conjugate, so
we're basically multiplying this
spectrum by a complex exponential and
then we're summing over, all these
results of, over all capital N examples.
And then there is a normalization factor
that we include, which is 1 over N.
So the main differences with the DFT
is that the complex
exponential are not conjugated.
So we have a positive exponent and
there is this normalization factor.
Apart from that is basically the same.
But conceptual is very different.
Basically what we're doing
here it's kind of a synthesis.
We are regenerating the sinusoids.
We are recomputing the sinusoids
that we identified.
So let's put an example.
If we start from spectrum,
like one we saw before in which
there was one positive
value at k equals 1.
So we started from
a sequence of four samples.
And we obtained a positive
value at k equal 1.
Okay, so this is a spectrum of a sequence.
And now if we apply this
Inverse DFT function,
therefore we multiply each
of these spectral samples.
By the samples of four sinusoids,
four complex sinusoids of
different frequencies,
we will see that the result is
basically the signal we started with.
So this is a complex signal.
The result that has 4,
4j, minus 4 and minus 4j.
So, this is the Inverse Fourier Transform of this spectrum.
And let's show an example.
So, for real signals,
we do not need the complete spectrum.
In order to recover the original signal.
We saw that it was symmetric so
it's enough to have half of the spectrum.
And typically,
we use the positive side of the spectrum.
So, if we have, for example, in this
figure we have a given magnitude spectrum.
And, of course we have a phase spectrum.
Then we can do the inverse of that, and
we can compute it using these equations.
So we first have to generate
the negative part of the spectrum, so
the positive part will be the magnitude.
Multiply by the complex exponential to,
the phase.
And the negative part is
going to be the magnitude at
the end multiplied by
the negative part of the phase.
Okay, and then if we do the, inverse DFT,
we apply that equation into this
whole sequence, this whole spectrum,
X of k, we will get back a real sinusoid.
Okay, so this is, a sinusoid.
That has the length of
the spectrum we started from.
In this case it's 64 samples,
the spectrum had 32 positive samples and
32 negative samples, and
the Inverse Fourier Transform has
these 64 samples of a real sinusoid.
Okay.
So we'll come back to these
concepts in the next lecture, so,
do not worry if you still are not
understanding completely this concept.
So again you find a lot of
information about the Discrete
Fourier Transform in Wikipedia.
And of course on the website of,
Julius, and
here you have all the standard,
credits that we have in every class.
In the first part of this lecture,
we introduce the DFT equation, and
in the second part, we have seen how the
DFT works when the input is a sinusoid.
We'll have also explained the inverse DFT.
If you have been able to understand this,
you're doing very good.
You should have not problem with the rest.
So see you next lesson, thank you.
