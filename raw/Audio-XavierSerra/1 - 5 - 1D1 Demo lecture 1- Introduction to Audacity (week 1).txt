Welcome to the course.
On Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications.
In this demonstration class,
the first class of demonstrations,
we will introduce Audacity.
Which is an audio software, that is
available under all the common platforms.
It's free.
It's available under an open license,
a GNU open license.
And it had been maintained and
is supported by a group of volunteers
that are doing a great job.
So, it's a great tool,
that we will use in class and and
I recommend you to get a grasp of it.
It it's used for quite a few
things related to audio editing.
We will focus on on the few of
the things that that we need,
very simple visualization and editings.
Let's first go to browser and
find it.
Okay if you type audacity in google,
the first link will be this sourceforge page in
which you can get quite a bit
of information about it.
documentation, how to get involved,
and the download page.
You can go directly to download it,
the last version of Audacity for
different platforms.
In this course we are using Ubuntu so
I recommend you to, to install it for
that platform, so
it's a distribution of of Linux.
I already did that.
There is good information in this
website on how to download it and
how to install it.
So, let's go directly to the,
the audacity program.
This is the, main interface of audacity.
That has the common
menus of sound editors.
Typically what we want to
do is open a sound file.
So we'll go to File, Open and
this is the directory where I
keep the sounds that we'll be
using in the in the the course.
So, let's open this piano dot wave file.
It asks me if I want to make a copy or
use directly the the disk file.
I think it's good to, make a copy.
Okay, and this is the, the visualization
of the content of the file, the waveform.
This file has particular formatting.
And here we have the information
about that formatting.
It's a mono file, one channel.
The sampling rate is 44,100 and
the bit depth is 32-bit float.
Which is the format that Audacity uses,
internally.
So, even if the original file was,
16 bits, which is, the case for
this sound, it converted to,
32 bit flow to make the operations easier.
Okay.
So, we can,
navigate a little bit through this file,
and that it has a common, Sort of zooming
features and moving around of the sound,
so you can select a portion
of these sound and
you can play this fragment, okay.
We can also, of course, say if we
don't have anything selected, and,
we go back to the, beginning,
it will play the whole sound file.
[MUSIC]
Okay, and one important aspect of
visualization is the time.
We will be, selecting, choosing,
time, so, it's important to,
get a very accurate reading of time, here
we have the horizontal axis in seconds,
and when we select a region, it we,
we see clearly what time we are selecting,
but from below here.
We see a more accurate
reading of the timing.
We have several options
of how we display time.
I recommend to use this milliseconds,
display.
So from here now we can see that,
the origin of this section
is 402 milliseconds.
And, the duration of this section,
because I specify here to visualize
the length, is 220 milliseconds.
Okay, that's going to be quite useful.
[SOUND] Then another useful visualization
is what we call the spectrogram.
Okay so, in, in here we can,
click the spectrogram.
And we can make it a little bigger.
And, this is the spectrogram
of the piano sound.
That has been computed, from the sound.
And now we can see the same
the whole piano sound.
And again we can do selection, playing.
[SOUND] Because this is just
a visualization of the sound.
[SOUND] And we can see the harmonics and
where the beginning of the notes are,
so it's a quite a,
I believe, much easier way to
visualize some aspects of the sound.
There is some, parameters that can be,
Chosen to to control the,
these analyses and visualization, so
if we go to Edit Preferences, and
we go to the Spectrogram section.
We have, different parameters that we
will talk about in class how to use, and
how to understand.
So for example, the window size, let's
just, for example, just change it now.
And I just changed the maximum frequency
to visualize so for example 1500.
[SOUND] And now we see another
visualization of the spectrogram,
having a change of parameters, okay.
So let's go back to the,
standard waveform.
And then let's also talk about what
transformations this software can do.
So under effects there is a whole
bunch of transformations that we can
apply and we can include many more because
this supports an open plugin platform.
That other developers,
have been developing, for
and therefore, on the website, you can,
you can use other other plugins,
to extend to this collection of effects.
For example, just use, a simple
transformation, the equalization which is
a common transformation that might be of
use to the kinds of things we'll be doing.
So for example, if we apply this
has different curves which refer to
different ways to equalize the sound.
[SOUND] For example, let's use,
like, telephone, which basically
means that it filters the sound as it was
going through a telephone, so it will
attenuate the low frequencies and
the high frequencies, frequencies that
do not go through telephone lines.
Okay, so when we apply that, then,
the sound is modified in the time
domain we don't see much, but if we go to
the frequency domain to the spectrogram.
We see that the high frequencies
have been clearly attenuated.
For the low frequencies, we don't see
because there is not enough room,
but if we had chosen in
the preferences to visualize
instead of the first 15,000 hertz, let's
say, to visualize the first 3,000 hertz.
Then, we will see that in
the lower frequencies also the,
the frequencies have been attenuated,.
Okay and that's basically what I wanted
to mention of course you can save
the sound files, you can cut and paste and
do quite a lot of things that I believe.
It's quite easy to to do and
from the documentation it's quite easy
to understand how to really take
advantage of all these functionalities.
Okay then let's go back to the slides and
[SOUND] what We talked about
today was Audacity, and
you can go to their website and
and have all that information from
there there is a lot of very
interesting documentation for it.
And for the piano sound,
use You can get it from free sound and
together with all these other sounds
that you will be using in class.
So that was helpful today, we introduced
Audacity, a sound editor that is quite
easy to use,
quite practical and it's open.
So I recommend very much that
you download it, use it and, and
try to do simple editings that will
be useful for later on in the course.
So, thank you very much.
