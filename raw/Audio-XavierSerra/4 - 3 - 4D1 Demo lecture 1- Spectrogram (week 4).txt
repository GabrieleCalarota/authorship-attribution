Welcome back, to the course on audio
signal processing for music applications.
This week we are talking about
the short-time Fourier transform and
the Spectrogram is basically
the output of the STFT,
is the visualization of the time
varying spectra that we compute.
So, in this demonstration class
I want to use the Spectrogram,
the Short Time Fourier Transform,
to analyze a voice sound, so
that we can understand better the STFT and
at the same time understand
better a given sound.
So we'll start with the SonicVisualizer.
And this is the sound I
want to analyze.
It's a note of a soprano singing,
let's hear that.
[MUSIC]
Okay, that's a quite high pitch sound.
And it has quite a bit of vibrato,
this frequency oscillation that is
characteristic of operatic singing.
And to understand a little better
the sound let's open the spectogram, so
let's open the pane on the spectogram.
So here it is.
we see now clearly some
information of this voice sound.
And we see these horizontal lines
that correspond to the harmonics and
we see this oscillation, which is
basically this vibrato that is present.
To go a little deeper,
let's open another pane,
with a single spectrum of this
time varying spectrogram.
So let's first show 
in a linear scale in
the horizontal axis.
Let's have lines as interpolation and
the window,
let's use the same window then for
the STFT so we'll use 1,024.
Okay, and this is it.
Let's maybe make it, zoom in and stretch so
that we see same things that we
would see in the spectrogram, okay?
So this is one slice of the spectrogram,
all these horizontal lines correspond
to these peaks that we see here.
Okay.
And now maybe let's change things.
Let's change for example
the window size.
If we change to 256 both analysis.
Okay, now what we're seeing
is a much smoother shape.
We're not seeing the individual harmonics.
We're just seeing an overall shape
which basically corresponds to
what we call the formants,
the resonances of the vocal tract,
which is what makes us be able to
distinguish between vowels, for example.
So each vowel has a characteristic
formant structure.
Of course if we move things
will change a little bit but
of course the vowel will remain the same
so it will not change that much.
If we go back to the analysis size
hat allows us to visualize the harmonics,
and when we move, well we see
few more changes because the harmonics
are changing more than just the formants.
Okay, so now if we want to change
the type of window, we can go to the
Preferences, and in the Analysis tab.
Let's put this away from this,
here in the last option we
see the window,
the Analysis window to be used, okay.
Currently is the Blackman window,
let's change for
example to Rectangular window.
Which is the the square that will
cut the signal, very abruptly.
Let's apply that.
Okay, so clearly, it doesn't look so nice.
A single spectrum looks with quite a lot kind of
noise, the noise floor is very high.
So, we see very few of the harmonics.
And in the spectrogram we see these
vertical lines, which is a kind of
a distortion of it.
so that's clearly not that good so
we definitely would prefer for
this sound the Blackman window.
Okay, now let's do the same kind
of analysis, using the sms-tools.
with the sms-tools we have 
the single spectrum
using the DFT option, or the time varying
spectrogram using the STFT option.
So let's first start
with a single spectrum.
Let's go to the soprano sound.
So soprano-E4.
Okay.
Then let's analyze the middle
of the sound, like 0.5, and
let's use the same values
that we used before.
1,024 for both FFT-size and
window-size with the Blackman window.
And we can compute.
Okay, and
this is basically what we saw before.
This is the 1,024 samples
we have started with.
This is the magnitude and phase spectrum.
And we see clearly the peaks
corresponding to the harmonics.
And in here we see the phase spectrum
which we didn't see before and
also we see the inverse of this.
So, this is the windowed signal
that we generate back by
taking the inverse FFT of this spectrum.
And of course we can do the same thing.
We can change windows, for example
if we change the window size to 256.
And also the FFT size, 256, and
the same location we
compute, we see much less samples.
The spectra are much smoother,
less information there.
One advantage of course,
that this interface will have
is that we can independently control
the window size from the FFT size.
So, we can put the FFT size 1,024 and
maybe a window size not that large,
maybe 801.
And we will Compute, okay.
We are taking less samples than before,
but still the frequency resolution
is quite good,
it's quite smooth because we have been
doing zero padding and so
the shape of the spectrum is quite nice.
Let's look at all this from the
short-time Fourier transform perspective,
from the spectrogram.
So we will get the same sound.
Okay and again let's put 1,024, 1,024, 
and the Hop size,
has to be at least much smaller
than the window size, in a way that
the overlap add factor, adds correctly.
So for 1,024, in the Blackman window,
at least we need one-fourth.
So let's put 256.
And we Compute.
Okay?
And this is the result.
So we have the input signal,
the magnitude spectrogram, the phases,
the time varying phases and
the output sound. And the output sound
[SOUND] is very much the same
than the original, because we have done
a good reconstruction with a good overlap.
However, if this overlap
is not correctly set, for
example let's put the same
than the window size, for example,
1,024, and let's Compute it.
Well, clearly now
there is something wrong in the output signal,
and if we listen to it [SOUND] okay?
Of course, we see this modulation,
that is at the frame rate.
Because we are not overlapping correctly,
so at every frame we see a burst of sound.
And they don't balance out
by the overlap factor.
So, we definitely need to
have a much smaller hop size.
And anyway, that's all I wanted to say.
Basically, I encourage you to play
around with these parameters.
You can change the window size.
You can change the FFT size, the Hop size,
the type of window, and in between
the DFT and the STFT, I believe you can
get a good grasp of all these different
parameters and the effect they have in
the visualization of the spectrogram.
And also in the reconstruction
of the signal.
So let's just finish and okay.
Today basically,
we have used SonicVisualiser to analyze a
voice sound and to visualize the
spectrogram and the individual spectrum.
We'll have also done the same thing
with the interface of the sms-tools and
of course we have used this sound, a
soprano sound from freesound.
So this hopefully has given you a more
practical view on the STFT.
And has allowed you to
understand how useful might be
to use this type of techniques
to visualize a particular sound.
In this case a soprano sound.
Of course this is just the
the beginning of this more analysis,
this more complex analysis.
So in next,
in next demonstration class, we're
going to analyze a more complex sound.
And we will see how we can analyze 
time-varying sounds that have much more
structure and how to use these spectrogram
analysis to get some insights on that.
So thank you very much for your attention
and I hope to see you next class.
