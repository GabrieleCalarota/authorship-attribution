Welcome to the course on
audio signal processing for
music applications and
to this first programming class.
In this lecture we introduce Python,
which is a high level programming language
that we'll use throughout the course very
much, in a lot of the things we will be
programming with and all the assignments
but this is not a programming course.
We will be just doing simple programs and
there's no need to have an extensive
background in programming but
please try to make sure that you have
some proficiency in Python and on
Ubuntu so that you can do the assignments
and understand what we will be doing.
First let's go to Python page,
this python.org.
This is the main page for Python in which
you will find a lot of tutorials and
information about it.
In the case of Ubuntu,
Python comes installed with it.
So if you open a terminal and type python,
you will see that it shows the version
of python that is installed,
in this particular case 2.7.6 so
this is good.
And in fact you can already start typing
and interacting with Python here.
There are many different
versions of Python,
especially there is a newer
version 3 point something.
And in our particular case,
we would like to use 2.7.
A lot of the packages we need to use
are only available under 2.7, so
please make sure that you have
version 2.7 point, something installed
on your Ubuntu and that you're able
to execute it from the terminal.
Okay now, apart from the basic
installation of Python,
we need to use several packages,
several collections
of functions that are going to
be important for our course.
In particular, in order to install them
we need to use the standard installation
application that Ubuntu has,
which is called apt-get.
But in order to install we need
to have super user permission.
So we'll do sudo apt-get and then.
We need to install
a whole bunch of packages.
In particular, we need to install
the basic development tools
then we will need to install a ipython
then we need to install matploblib,
we will need also to install numpy, scipy,
and pygame and finally cython.
Okay since we are in super user
we need to give the password.
Okay and in my particular case I have
already installed all these packages so
it doesn't need to install anything else.
Okay, all these packages
are quite well known packages and
you can find quite a bit
of information about them.
So for example iPython, which is
a interactive shell that we'll be using or
NumPy, which is the package for
doing array processing.
All our sounds are going to be arrays, so
we will be using NumPy to process
these arrays often numbers.
We will be plotting a lot of things so
matplotlib is going to be our package for
plotting sounds and all these
analysis that we will be generating.
SciPy is the package for
signal processing and
a lot of the functions we will
be using come from this package.
And then Cython is a package for
being able to interface with C
code there will be a number of
functions in our code
that is written in C.
In order compile it,
we will need to use Cython.
And finally we will be having some
interfaces in the programs and
we will be using pygame which
is a package for developing
games that we will be using the interface
facilities for that for us.
So anyway so all of these are extensions
of Python that will be necessary to have.
For our course, so
please make sure that you install them and
in the class we will talk
about them a little bit.
Okay, so let's start.
So in order to start we
will just use iPython, okay.
So we type iPython and
it already tells me the version
of Python again,
that iPython uses which is the same one.
The system install which is 2.7.6,
that's good.
And in here it gives me some shell,
interactive shell that I can
start typing commands and
I'll do operations, so for example we
can do standard arithmetic operations.
We can just declare variables and operate
with them and in order to deal with sounds
as I said, we need to deal with arrays.
In order to do that,
we need to import the package for
our array operation, which was numpy.
So we do import numpy and we
normally will give it a name to refer to
it, so we don't have to type everything.
So we just, for example,
import Numpy as np and
now we have all the functions
of Numpy in there.
So we can now declare a variable a,
that is going to be an array.
So we can call the function
of NP call array.
And we just can create
an array of different numbers.
For example like this, okay.
And this is the array a.
And if we type a, it displays this array.
We can access elements of this array.
For example the third element or
we can access all the element from
the location one to the third.
Which is going to be the first and
the one and two elements.
And if we want to plot this array,
we need the matplotlib.
So we need to import,
matplotlib but in particular we
need to import the module that does two
dimensional plotting which is pyplot.
Okay.
And again we will use a name, a short
name to refer to this, for example plt.
Okay and now we can plot,
use the function plot of pyplot
to display the array a, this
generates a display object.
And in order to show it we will
need to type the show command.
Okay and this is the figure with
the array values that we had.
Okay now let's continue
on issues of programming,
if we want to write some
more sophisticated programs,
what we will be doing
is using a text editor.
This is the gedit text editor,
which is the default editor of Ubuntu.
And now in here we can type
the commands that Python calls that
we need in the interactive shell.
So for example we can start by
importing the numpy and calling it np.
Then we can have a variable
A that will an array of numpy
array of let's say, zero,
one, two, three, four, five.
Okay.
And now let's do some
operation to these array.
For example let's have a new array,
which will be the reverse version of A.
And how will we do that?
Well, we have access to all
the indexes of the array but
we use the increment of minus one.
In this way,
we will go reading backwards of array.
And then we can just
print this variable b.
And now we can save it
in our home directory.
Let's call reverse dot py and
that will be file,
a python script that we have saved.
So now we are here in the iPython.
We are in the directory,
the home directory and
in this home directory we see
the file that we saved reverse.py and
we can execute this file, we do it
by typing run and type in reverse.
Okay and it returns the print command.
So it returns the array A but reversed.
So it returns b,
which is the reverse version.
Okay so we can-
this way we can develop some
more sophisticated programs.
And we can execute them interactively from
iPython and we can go back and forth,
that's going to be a very powerful way to
develop interactively, develop things.
And that's all I wanted to say so
basically we have talked about Python and
I refer to the Python.org website for
more information about that,
we have used iPython as our interactive
shell in which we can program and
execute files from and
finally we had been using and
talking about some packages that extend
the potential of the basic Python.
Particularly the numpy for
processing array.
Scipy, which will be a package very much
used for signal processing operations,
for tools, matplotlib which is used for
plotting things and
finally another important one
is pygame that will be used for
our interaction, our interfaces and it has
a lot of potential for sound processing.
And that's all for today, we have seen
a very basic introduction to Python.
Sorry.
So I hope that you have time by yourself
to go more into these and look at some
tutorials and some further information.
And that's all next class we will
extend this presentation and
we'll start talking about
specifically how to deal with sounds.
So, thank you very much for
your attention.
