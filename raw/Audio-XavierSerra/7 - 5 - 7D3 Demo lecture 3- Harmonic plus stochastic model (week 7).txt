Welcome back to the course on Audio Signal
Processing from music applications.
In the previous demonstration class
we talked about the harmonic
plus residual model.
We actually analyzed
the sound with the model,
with the sms-tools, and we were able to
identify the harmonics, subtract them
from the original sound and
obtain a residual,
which then we combined with the harmonics
to obtain the original signal.
In this demonstration class we want to go
a little bit beyond that by approximating
the residual with the stochastic model.
And in the case that the residual is
close to an stochastic signal,
then this will be a good representation,
the harmonic plus
the stochastic component, to
represent a sound.
So, let's start and let's open the,
the GUI of sms-tools.
And we will start with
the sound of the flute sound.
Okay, so let's listen to this flute sound.
[SOUND] Okay, so 
it's a very stable note,  quite
clearly defined,in
fact is an A4 and it clearly has some
breathing quality that will be relevant
for this idea of the stochastic component.
In order to decide what window
size, well again let's 
use the Blackman window, since it's stable
sound Blackman will be a good choice
for being able to get low
the side lobes and
getting a good kind of signal to noise
ratio in terms of the window.
So in order to compute what
is the best window size, so
we'll have to just do 6, which is the
number of bins of the Blackman window,
times the sampling rate, 44,100,
divide by the fundamental
frequency of this sound, and
this is A4, so this is 440 Hertz.
Okay?
So 601 would be a good window to use.
Even that we really want to get a good
resolution of the harmonics and
try to minimize the rest of
the components, and it's quite stable,
we can afford to take a longer window,
maybe, so let's take 801 samples.
The FFT size, again, let's,
we can take a bigger FFT, so
that we get a smoother spectrum.
So, 2,048.
Okay and well lets analyze
just in the middle of the sound.
This is quite a long sound, so letâ€™s do it like that.
So, this is the samples
of the input signal.
In the spectrum we see quite well
the low frequency harmonics.
And similar to the organ that we analyzed
before,
at the high frequencies areas,
there is quite a bit of kind of
unstable or
kind of very stochastic type of
components that are not so
clearly defined as partials.
So they may be there might
be some harmonics or
partials, but they're kind of a mask, and
are difficult to identify here.
Anyway, so okay, so now let's just
go directly to the harmonic model.
And let's apply the same parameters.
For example 801.
2,048.
Now we have to choose the parameters for
the peak detection and harmonic detection.
I don't think we need to go very
much down in the spectrum for
the harmonics,
because, as we saw, there are not that many.
In terms of the duration of the harmonics,
I think it's good to make sure that
they're long, it is a stable note,
So you might want to put like
.2 in terms of the minimum duration,
in terms of number of harmonics, there
are clearly not that many so, I'm sure
with forty should be plenty.
And, we have to set the minimum and
maximum fundamental, so
that 440 fits here, so
I'm sure if we put 300 and 500
should be plenty.
And the error for the peak detection,
well let's take the default 7.
And the deviation, let's start
with this value, see what happens.
Oh, and
of course we need to get flute sound.
Okay, now we can compute it.
Okay, so
clearly we got quite a few harmonics,
and some here that appear and disappear.
Of course, we have to realize that here
we're just plotting the first 5,000 hertz.
If you want to see more and
what's going on in
the higher frequencies we should
display it a little bit differently.
Okay so let's just listen to the result.
[SOUND]
Okay.
that's pretty good.
That's a quite accurate rendition of that.
Of course 
it's different from the original sound. In fact,
if we hear back the original,
[SOUND] The original has more brighter
type of of quality and this is because
it has all these other components.
Of course, we can play around
with these parameters, for
example, to allow for
more harmonics to appear.
So, for example, if we allow let's
say, put .1 here and we compute it again.
Yeah, now, we are allowing these high
harmonics which are very unstable to
appear sort of more, but
of course all these jumps
are not really that good so
that means that these harmonics
are not really stable so
they are really buried into
the, kind of that noise or
the the breath that we also hear.
Okay.
Now we can go ahead and
use the harmonic plus residual model,
so that we can listen to the residual.
And let's again use the same parameters,
the flute sound, let's put 800.
Let's put 2048, and so
the threshold minus 80.
The minimum duration, let's just put 0.2.
Number of harmonics, yeah,
we don't need that many and well
these will be okay at 350 and
700, and this
I think 7 was all right
and yeah, let's make it 
not as open in terms of
the deviation as before,
let's just put maybe 0.02,
see what happens.
Okay, so here we see the original and
the harmonics and
maybe we see a few more than before.
And synthesize.
So let's listen to the residual.
[SOUBD] Okay, that's a pretty
nice residual, very [SOUND].
We hear the attack, and
the attack, in fact, there is this
red in here, during the attack
iss clear louder this breath and
then it's just sort of gets attenuated and
we hear a very clear
breath noise throughout.
Okay.
So
now so this is very much an
stochastic signal.
It's, it's very noisy so
that means that we can apply
the stochastic analysis to that.
So, now let's use the harmonic
plus the stochastic model and
let's get the same type of parameters.
Of course, we can play around these
parameters to get better values.
But the ones we chose they look okay so
let's, then let's put 0.2 here,
let's get the number of harmonics.
Yeah, I think 40 harmonics and
these was all right,
this was 7 and this was 0.02.
Okay, now we,
the parameter that is specific of
stochastic analysis is
the stochastic approximation factor.
And here, by default is .1.
So it means that it reduces
the whole spectrum by 90% so
it only, it will quantitize
kind of the resolution.
To one tenth of what it originally was.
So, let's just try this.
Okay.
So, clearly, now,
we see, Well, we see differently.
Because, in this one we are showing
the range from zero to 14,000 hertz.
So, in fact, we're seeing
quite a bit more.
So we see more of
the stochastic component.
but, As we see, the harmonics
are very much on the lower side.
Above 5,000 hertz
There isn't that much.
There is some of this.
But maybe.
These, even these lines should not be
considered harmonics and maybe 
they should be discarded.
But let's listen to the,
the stochastic component.
[SOUND] Okay.
Of course we have lost
like a little bit
of the details that the residual had.
But it definitely keeps
these breathy noise.
Of course, it's not that loud.
So when we put it together with
the original signal, with the harmonics,
[SOUND] Okay, so it sounds good.
But clearly
the harmonics are taking over and
they are kind of masking quite
a bit this stochastical point.
We have to listen to it quite
carefully if we want to be able to
distinguish the stochastical
component of this type of sound.
And that's basically all I wanted to say.
Let's, go back.
So we have talked about harmonic plus
stochastic model.
And and we have used the sms-tools,
the interface, that has allowed us
to play around with this model.
And of course, the sound, this flute sound,
Is in freesound.
So hopefully
that has given you a view of the potential
of the harmonic plus stochastic model.
It's a little bit different from
the harmonic plus residual,
but the main difference is
that now with the stochastic,
representation of the residual we will
be able to do quite a bit of things.
Next week in fact we're going to 
be doing transformations to these sounds.
And, the stochastic representation will
allow us to do that, weather in the
residual would not be able
to give us that flexibility.
So anyway, so that's all for
this demonstration class and
I hope to see you next lecture.
Thank you very much.
