Welcome again to the course on a audio signal
processing for music applications.
In the last lecture, we talked about
stochastic signals and how to model them.
With that
we can now extend the sinusoidal and
harmonic models that we talked about
before into the concept of sinusoidal or
harmonic plus residual or
stochastic modelling.
We will decompose sounds
into these two parts,
the sinusoidal or harmonic one,
and the residual or
ideally a stochastical one, if this
residual is the stochastic signal.
So in this lecture we will
combining all the models we
have been talking about until now.
We'll put together the sinusoidal or
harmonic modelling with
the idea of residual component.
For that, we'll need to talk
about the subtraction of the
the sinusoids or the harmonics
in order to obtain the residual.
And we will talk about a system
that puts these together into
the harmonic plus residual system.
Then we will introduce the stochastic
model and we'll put together
the sinusoidal and, or harmonic models,
with the stochastic ones for the residual.
So in order to do that
we will need to talk about how to model
the residual as an stochastic component.
And finally we will make an example
of this system that combines
the harmonic plus the stochastic analysis
into an analysis synthesis system.
The sinusoidal plus residual model is
an extension of the sinusoidal model.
We assume that a sinusoidal model is
not able to represent the whole sound.
And that there is a residual component
that is perceptually relevant.
So it's a sound that needs to be kept.
So in here we see in this equation that
y, the signal,
is modeled with this sum of sinusoids,
time varying sinusoids with amplitude and
frequency.
And we have xr which is our residual.
So the whole sound is ys, our sinusoidal
component, and xr our residual signal.
And xr, is simply computed by subtracting
the sinusoids from the original signal.
And this is what we will be
talking about in this lecture.
Okay but it's much better, at
least from our point of view,
to show this model from
the spectral point of view.
Because that's where we're going to
be developing all these models from.
Okay?
So here we see the sum of the sinusoid as
the sum of the transform the windows
shifted to a frequency and scaled to the
Amplitudes of these sinusoids, plus
the spectrum of this residual component.
And the spectrum of this
residual component,
now this is how we going to do it,
is obtained by subtracting the spectrum
of the sinusoids from the spectrum
of the original signal.
Okay.
So, let's show an example
exactly how this will work.
This is one frame of a sound and
here we can show the different
steps involved in this harmonic
plus residual analysis.
On the left top we see our frame,
windowed frame of a flute sound.
Okay, so
it's just a few periods of a flute sound.
And then below that we see the harmonic
analysis that we do from the spectrum.
So we do 
the spectral analysis, the peaks, and
we select the peaks with these
blue crosses that are really
the harmonics of that particular sound.
And below it we see the actual phase
of the spectrum with the crosses and
the phase of these harmonics.
Okay.
Then what we do is we have to
synthesize these harmonics, and
this is what we see on the right side
with the light red and light cyan color.
So, the light red is the synthesized
harmonics of the sound,
of that particular frame.
Of course this is a different
FFT size, the shapes 
of these lobes is different
because the window is different.
It's a black window using the synthesis.
So, this is the synthesize spectrum and
then we have to subtract this
spectrum from the original spectrum.
Strictly speaking, we don't subtract
it from the spectrum on the left.
We subtract this from another generated
spectrum that has the same parameters.
So that we can subtract the two of 
the same size and of the same window size.
And then it we subtract this
synthesized sinusoid, or the harmonics,
from the original one,
we get this dark red and dark cyan color.
Okay, and this is the residual spectrum,
in magnitude and phase representation.
And if we take the inverse
of that we see
the residual signal in the time domain and
that's what we see on the top right plot.
In with we see the original flute
sound, of course with the right
windowing and the right size
that we have in the synthesis.
And we see the residual signal,
this dark blue one.
And again,
this is not just an error signal.
This is a, in fact, this is a relevant
component, is a relevant part of
the sound that we want to recover.
So the whole system, if we put together all
these analyses in a frame by frame type
of thing and put it together
into a whole analysis synthesis system,
we get this block diagram in which
we start from the signal, x of n,
then we window it, we compute the FFT,
obtaining the magnitude and phase spectrum,
we detect the peaks.
Out of those peaks we find
the fundamental frequency.
And once we have this
fundamental frequency,
we can identify the harmonics
of that sound and
we can synthesize those harmonics
with the Blackman-Harris window.
Okay?
So, we have another spectrum, yh.
That can be subtracted from the original
signal, but in order to do that we need to
recompute another spectrum of
the original signal with a window and
a size that is comparable with
the size that we used in the synthesis.
So, we will choose a window size
that normally will be 512 samples.
We'll use a Blackman-Harris window, so
that the shape of this X
of k that we now compute
can be easily subtracted
from Yh, so
it’s just a complex subtraction and
we get x capital X of r which
is our residual spectrum.
Okay, and this residual spectrum can
be added to the harmonic spectrum.
Then we can compute the inverse fft and
then do the overlap
iterating over the whole sound.
We can see here an example of the analysis
of a particular sound using the harmonic
plus residual model.
So here, we took the flute
sound that we heard before.
And so on top we see the spectrogram
of this flute sound and
superposed we see the harmonics
that have been obtained.
So let's listen to this
harmonic synthesis.
[NOISE] Okay, and
these harmonics are subtracted from this
background spectrogram, and
we obtained these lower
plotd, which are the spectrogram
of the residual component.
So let's just now listen to this
residual that has been obtained.
[NOISE] Okay, it's soft.
That is clearly very relevant.
It's basically the breath
noise of the instrument,
which is an important part of
the characteristics of this sound.
But this residual component 
is a complete sound.
Therefore is difficult to process.
We need to model it,
we need to be able to approximate it
with a particular modeling approach.
And, and of course, we need 
to model it with the stochastic model.
So let's introduce the stochastic
approximation of this residual component,
and let’s present this idea of
the sinusoidal plus stochastic model.
So very similar to what we saw before.
So we have the signal to
be the sum of sinusoids
plus the stochastic signal.
Now this is stochastic signal,
or stochastic component.
It's not just the subtraction of
the sinusoids minus the original signal.
But is actually the result
of a modeling approach.
So, below here we see the equation of
The modeling of these
stochastic component.
The stochastic component is a result
of filtering white noise with
the impulse response of the approximation
of this residual signal.
So we have the impulse
response of every frame
of this residual signal and
we obtain this impulse response
that approximate the spectral shape of that.
So in fact, is much better to visualize
this model in the frequency domain.
So here, we see on the top the equation of
the sum of the sinusoids, the sum of 
of the analysis windows, plus
the spectrum of the stochastic component.
And now the stochastic component is
this idea of a filtered white noise,
but in the frequency of the main
is the product of
the approximation of the absolute
value of the residual signal
multiplied by e to the j and
the phase of the random the white
noise, I said the random numbers.
Okay so, the magnitude spectrum is
the approximation of the residual and
the phase spectrum is
the white noise basically,
the phase spectrum of the white noise.
This is the concept of the stochastic
approximation that we saw in
the previous lecture.
Okay, so with this we can actually
see how in a single spectrum,
we actually perform this stochastic
approximation of the residual.
So we start from on the top, with magnitude
the spectrum of a signal, the harmonics.
And then below, the light red,
is the synthesize spectrum, the mYh.
And then this is subtracted
from the original spectrum.
Again it's a spectrum that
will have to be recomputed.
And then we obtained the,
the next curve, which is the mxr,
which is the residual spectrum, okay?
And this residual spectrum can
be approximated with a smooth,
a smooth curve,
which is this mYst, which is
this sort of a line
approximation of this residual.
And this is going to be
our stochastic model.
So we can put it together
into an analysis synthesis system and
its very similar to what we saw before.
So we start from the signal, we compute
fft we find the peaks, we find harmonics.
We synthesize them in the frequency domain
and we subtract them from another spectrum
of the original signal, we computed it to
be able to subtract it, and then what is
new in this model is the
stochastic approximation of the residual.
So we take this residual spectrum.
We run it through the stochastic
approximation module.
And then we can synthesize.
And we can synthesize the stochastic
component by basically,
the idea is filtering white noise, but,
in the implementation is basically
taking the phases of random numbers,
and applying the stochastic
approximation magnitude spectrum.
And this results into a spectrum
that then can be sum
to the spectrum of the harmonics, and
perform exactly the same thing
that we have done before.
So, performed FFT and the overlap-add.
So let's now see an example of a complete
analysis synthesis of a particular sound.
So we are taking this saxophone sound.
Let's listen to that.
[MUSIC]
Okay, and then, below it we have the two
representations that we have obtained.
The harmonics, and
the stochastic component.
The spectrogram of
the stochastic component.
Let's listen to the harmonics.
[MUSIC]
Now we may not appreciate
what it's missing, but
when we listen to the stochastic
approximation [SOUND] we have to make it
a little bit louder in order
to actually listen what is going on.
Well with these two
components we basically have
analyzed and
model the original signal.
And we can put them together and
generate the synthesized sound.
[SOUND] That captures most of what is
perceptually relevant in this sound.
So for these topics that I discussed
in this lecture there's not that
many references, in terms of tutorials or
sort of more introductory material.
But there is quite a bit of articles that
have been proposing different strategies
to analyze sinusoids, obtain residuals,
approximating the residuals et cetera.
So in this link that I put here,
on this the website of the MTG,
I have kept some articles.
Well, quite a bit of articles
that have been published related to
these issues so feel free to go there and
you can, you can sort of
find those articles, and
that's all basically in this lecture.
We have covered the most advanced models
that we'll be presenting in this course.
We basically combined all the previous
models developing a variety of
analyses and
synthesis techniques that can be applied
to many sounds, and for many applications.
In the next lecture we will
focus on how these models can be
used to transform sounds.
So I think,
we're going to start having fun and
doing some interesting new sounds.
So I hope to see you then.
Bye-bye.
