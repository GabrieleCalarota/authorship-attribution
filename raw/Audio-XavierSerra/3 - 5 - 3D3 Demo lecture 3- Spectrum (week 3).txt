Hello, welcome back to the course on audio
signal processing for music applications.
In the previous demo classes of this week,
we have analyzed some sounds,
we analyzed some electronic periodic
signals, and we analyzed some real sounds.
And we used audacity and SonicVisualizer,
specially to look at
the spectrum of these sounds.
And now in this lecture I want
to continue that and try to use
the tools that we have developed for
this particular class, so the sms-tools and
do the DFT analysis to see if
we can understand some sound.
So let's first open with
Audacity a file, so
we can see the overall view of the sound.
Okay, so let's take the violin sound.
So this is a note of a violin,
it's quite stable, so we can see
that it's a length of two seconds.
But
instead of using Audacity let's analyze
it with with the interface of sms-tools.
So let's go to the models_interface
directory and just type python and
the models_GUI and
this will open up the interface.
Okay, this is the interface
of of the sms-tools,
where it has all the different models
that we are going to be talking about.
And now let's go to open
up the violin sound.
And using the DFT module,
so we can hear the violin.
[SOUND] Okay, so we hear
this note of the violin.
And in the parameters, well let's choose
a size, a portion of a sound to analyze.
And for example letâ€™s use 512.
We have to use a power of two for
the FFT size,
because the FFT algorithm requires that
and we don't have to use the window
size of the same length but
for now let's do that.
And now we have to choose where
we take these 512 samples.
Let's say we choose the middle of
the sound, so let's take in second 1,
and we compute it.
Okay, so this is the analysis results.
So, these are the 512 samples,
starting at second 1.
And then we have computed the DFT
of that using the FFT algorithm.
And we are displaying
half of the spectrum.
We are displaying the positive
side, because its symmetric.
So therefore, the negative side
is not required because it
has the same information, so
we're just plotting the positive side.
Both for the magnitude and
the phase spectrum.
In the x-axis we are plotting
frequency in hertz, and
so we are plotting from zero
to half the sampling rate.
Okay so the sampling rate was 44,100.
so here we're applying up to 22,050.
Okay and the amplitude in
the magnitude spectrum is in decibels,
as we explained, so
we are showing it in dB
and the maximum amplitude is minus 20.
So here we don't have a complete,
the signal only reach .4,
so that corresponds to minus 20 decibels.
And it goes down to minus 120.
And the phase, we are plotting it
using the unwrapping function.
So instead of limiting the phase
from 0 to 2 pi,
we are leting it unwrap so
that we see a much smoother shape.
And that's going to be quite good.
Quite useful.
And then finally, out of this
we compute the inverse
and we compute another time domain signal.
It's not the same as
the input signal because we
have applied a window in the input signal
and this is what we are seeing here.
This is the windowed version
that is the one that is
basically captured in the spectrum.
Okay, now let's try to see if we can
understand something on the sound.
And typically the magnitude
spectrum is the most useful one.
Here, well we see things, but maybe we
don't see what we would like to see.
Which is to visualize
the harmonics of that.
So this might be because
these are not enough samples.
We do not have enough
information to visualize and
separate all these frequencies.
We need a bigger frequency analysis.
So instead of having 512
let's take the next power of two,
so the next FFT size 1,024.
Okay and
now it's a little bit better, okay?
So we can see, compared
with the previous one,
that, of course we have
taken more samples, and
the magnitude spectrum gives
us some more information.
For example here,
we see clearly these peaks and
this corresponds to
the harmonics of the sound.
So, that's a quite useful
information.
Okay, now maybe in order to see
what can we understand about the sound,
let's look at another
portion of the sound.
Of course, as we saw,
the sound is quite stable.
But if we go into the beginning,
if we zoom into the very beginning of
the sound, there is a region of the attack
that's a little bit different, so
let's see if we can
capture that difference.
So let's go back to our interface,
and let's do the same analysis,
but instead of doing the analysis at
time one, let's do it at time zero.
So we compute from time zero.
And now
well we see clearly that the sound is
maybe not as smooth we had it
during the middle of the sound.
And what we also see is that
the spectrum is a little bit different.
Okay, we see during the attack that
maybe the harmonics are not so
clear, because at the beginning of
the sound there is more the attack of
the bow, of the noise, so
the harmonic are not so well identified
Whether in the middle of the sound,
clearly the harmonic got stronger.
Instead, at the beginning
there is more noise.
So these irregularities that we
see in the time domain waveform
are captured in the spectrum by seeing
all these more, kind of random, and
sort of irregular shapes
that we see in the spectrum.
Okay, so this is the kind of things
that the spectrum analysis allows us to
visualize and therefore to understand.
Now let's go back to the
the window of the control parameters.
Let's go back to the middle of the sound.
And let's talk about the difference
between how many samples we take and the
FTT size we compute.
We do not have to take the same
number of samples of the FFT.
For example, we can take 801 samples and
then zero-pad to the FTT size and
compute the result.
So if we do that, okay.
This is similar to
the previous analysis we did
before in which
we took more samples,
we took 1024, so
this now there is less samples.
And the spectrum well,
they look okay both.
Of course in the one that we took
more samples of the input signal,
we see the harmonics a little bit better,
than the one that we have
computed now with 800 samples.
But, it's as smooth as the previous
one, so both are equally smooth.
This is because the FFT size,
in both cases is 1,024.
Okay, now let's maybe get rid
of the one we just computed
and let's compute again the 1,024
samples, which may be the
the most useful one.
And, now let's try to understand
a little bit more about the sound.
By zooming into the beginning
where it seems that
most activity and
the most interesting information is.
So with this figure interface of
Python we can choose a rectangle,
so for example, in the magnitude spectrum
we can just choose the first 5,000 hertz.
Okay.
and we can see these harmonics, 
the peaks of the first 5,000
hertz quite more clearly.
And we can do the same thing
with the phase spectrum.
Okay, so
we'll take the first 5,000 hertz and this
is the phase of what correspond to
these frequencies, the same frequencies.
Okay, now we can start seeing other
things of the sound, for example
we can see that these peaks
are equally spaced and
we can look at the frequency of them,
here in the lower right corner
it tells us where, what is the location
of the x, of the cursor, of the x axis.
And we see that this
is around 240 hertz.
Okay?
Because
the dimension is in hertz.
And if we look at the next one,
it's around 480 hertz.
So in fact,
these are the harmonics of the sound.
The first is the fundamental.
So the fundamental is around 240 hertz.
And this twice the fundamental, and
this will be all the multiples,
the harmonic multiples of the fundamental.
Okay so that's good, so
that's a way to identify
the fundamental frequency of the sound.
And in the phase spectrum
it's pretty nice.
Basically what we are seeing,
in the corresponding frequency of
the harmonics, we are seeing the phase of
these harmonics, the phase at time zero,
where we have centered the analysis.
So if we look here, for
example, the corresponding
location of the first harmonic
it says that is around minus 2.8 radians,
because the vertical axis is in radians.
And this is in fact the phase at time
zero of this particular harmonic.
And we can go to the next harmonic and
measure the phase, or to the next harmonic.
So visually we can
identify the magnitude and
phase of the components of this sound.
So that's going to be
very important and very useful.
And clearly with this interface, with
the sms-tools, we can zoom into the sound
in ways that the SonicVisualizer or
Audacity was not so easy to do.
So anyway, so that's all I wanted to say.
So basically we have gone through
the sms-tools,
this interface of the DFT in particular.
And we have analyzed a violin sound
which is available in freesound.
And we have played around a little bit
with the different parameters of the DFT.
Okay, and that's all for
today, with these three
demonstration classes we have tried to
see the different tools that we can use.
For analyzing the sound, visualizing
the time domain, visualizing the spectrum.
But of course there is much more to do.
So next week we will continue,
and we will go into a little
bit more complicated things.
So I hope to see you then.
Bye-bye.
