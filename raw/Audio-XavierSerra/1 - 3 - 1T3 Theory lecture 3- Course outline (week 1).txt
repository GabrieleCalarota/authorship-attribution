Welcome again to the course in audio
signal processing for music applications.
In the previous theory lecture I
gave an overview of the feel of
audio signal processing as an introduction
and motivation to the course.
Now I want to outline the specific topics
that we will present in the course.
Which even though cover a tiny part
of the audio signal processing field.
They're very relevant to
understand many concepts and
methods used in audio
signal processing systems.
Especially the ones for
music applications.
As introduction to the course this
week we have given a context of
the audio signal processing field.
Given an outline of the course.
And we will go over in the next class,
over the basic mathematics that
are required to follow the course.
Then next week we will start
by introducing the discrete
Fourier transform.
This transform is the basis for
everything we will do.
And, we will try to understand
every component of it.
So we'll go through the DFT equation, then
we will go through complex exponentials,
the scalar product in the DFT,
the DFT of complex sinusoids,
the DFT of real sinusoids.
And we'll finish with the inverse-DFT.
So to reconstruct the original signal.
Then in in week three,
in order to better understand the DFT,
we will go over the basic theorems and
properties of the Fourier transform.
And these are the concept of linearity.
Shift, symmetry and convolution.
Then we'll talk about energy
conservation and decibels.
The concept of phase unwrapping and
zero padding.
The use of the Fast Fourier Transform.
Which is the algorithm that we will
be using to implement the DFT.
And then the FFT together with
the concept of zero-phase windowing.
And finally we'll put it together
into an analysis synthesis system.
So then on week four, we will go to
the Short-time Fourier Transform,
which is the first version of the Fourier
transform that can be used in real sounds.
Those are some signals
that change in time.
We will present the first complete
analysis synthesis system of
the course that is of some practical use.
So we'll start with the STFT equation,
then talk about the analysis window,
then about the FFT size and hop size.
And the very common concept which
is the time frequency compromise,
which is fundamental to understand,
the Short-time Fourier Transform.
And finally,
we will discuss the concept of
the Inverse Short-time Fourier Transform.
So with that we can,
put together an analysis-synthesis system.
Then, on week five we will
go a step further and
we will be building on top of
the Short-time Fourier Transform.
What we will call, the sinusoidal model.
We'll present the,
the equation of the sinusoidal model.
Then we will introduce the concept
of what are sinusoids seen from
the frequency domain, seen from the spectrum.
And then we will talk about how we will
actually find those sinusoids, and
the concept is going to be the,
the idea of spectral peaks.
And then we'll talk about how to,
to analyze, identify this sinusoids in,
as as time varying sinewaves in the
spectrogram, in a time varying spectrum.
And finally again,
we'll talk about synthesis.
So again,
building up an analysis synthesis system,
based on this concept
of sinusoidal modeling.
Then the next week on week six.
We will be assuming
that sound is harmonic.
And then if we do that assumption,
we can develop much more powerful model,
what we will call the harmonic model.
Which is a sinusoidal model,
in which we add the constrains that all
the sinusoids are multiple
of a fundamental frequency.
So we'll introduce
the harmonic model equation,
then we'll talk about three concepts
that many times we confuse, which
is the concept of sinusoids, the concept
of partials and the concepts of harmonics.
Then we will introduce the concept on
monophonic and polyphonic signals.
Because the analysis techniques we will be
using are quite distinct if we apply them
to monophonic or polyphonic signals.
And finally we'll talk about
how to detect the harmonics.
To do that,
we will complement this discussion with
idea of fundamental frequency detection.
A harmonic sound is one that
has a fundamental frequency.
So we need to understand these and
be able to implement techniques to
analyze the fundamental frequency.
Then on week seven we will
add some more complexity.
Because many sounds cannot be well
modeled with sinusoids or with harmonics.
So we need to worry about the parts of
sounds, attacks, non linerarities, noises.
That are not well modeled with sinusoids.
And for this,
we introduce the idea of modelling sounds,
with sinusoids plus residual.
And in that concept, we need to introduce
the concept of stochastic model.
So how signals can be modeled using this,
this concept of stochastic signals.
Then we will actually talk about
how to approximate sounds with
these stochastic models.
And then we will introduce the, this model
of sinusoids or harmonics plus residual.
So, the signal that is left that is not
modeled well with sinusoids and harmonics.
So therefore we'll,
we'll need to talk about subtracting
these residual, obtaining these residual.
And then these residual, hopefully in many
situations, can be a stochastic signal.
And therefore then we can
present these sinusoidal or
harmonic plus a stochastic model.
Therefore for that will need to
introduce the, the concept of how to
model the residual with this
concept of stochastic signals.
So in this this will be
quite dense lecture,
because we will be talking quite
a bit about very different.
Models and that complement each other, and
that can be a little bit complex from
this end of the first approximation.
Okay, and
then basically that's going to be all
the models we will be talking about.
I mean the, rest of the, classes,
the, the next three classes,
we will basically talk about applications
and more kind of advanced topics.
So, as I mentioned in this course we
focus on two types of applications,
one is sound transformations.
So in this week eight, we will go over
the models that we have presented.
And show the types of transformations
that are possible to do with them.
So for example, we will talk about
the Short-Time Fourier Transform, and
what can we do in terms of transformation.
So, specifically filtering or morphing.
Then we will go over the sinusoidal model,
and what type of transformations.
Basically focusing on time and
frequency scaling.
Then, on the harmonics
plus residual model.
We will focus on the idea
of pitch transposition.
And finally on the most elaborative
model that we will have introduced,
which is the harmonics
plus stochastic model,
we will talk about time stretching and
morphing.
Then on week nine we will talk
about the second major application we
would like to focus on in this class.
Which is the idea of sound description.
So, with with what we have
presented we can extract
features of a sound in a way that
are relevant to describe it.
So we'll first focus on the idea
of audio features that can be
obtained from this spectral
analysis that we have talked about.
And then we will talk about how to
use these type of techniques to
describe more complex
music or signals and concepts of
like a whole collection of sounds.
How do we handle the analysis of not just
one sound, but a collection of sounds?

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,800And finally on the, the last week
of classes on the tenth week.
We will review all the models and
outline related topics that we have
not been able to cover in class.
We will present other Fourier-based sound models and
we'll also present other models that are
not Fourier-based, again so we'll review the class.
And then go beyond this signal
processing for music applications.
Things that we have been talking.
That's all in terms of references.
As in every class all the content is
available online and
with open licenses so.
Feel free to review all the content and
have access to everything
I have been mentioning.
So this is all for
this lecture we have done
a quick outline of the course, going over
the theory topics that we will cover.
So from now on we are really starting
going into signal processing.
So, thank you for attention and
I'll see you next class.
