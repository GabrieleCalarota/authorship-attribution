Welcome back to the course on Audio
Signal Processing for Music Applications.
In this demonstration class
I want to talk about periodic signals.
Periodic signals are at the basis
of understanding most signals,
and are also at the basis
of Fourier analysis,
so it's good to talk
a little bit about them.
Let's start by opening Audacity and
generating some periodic signals.
So here it has a Tone Generator.
And the most fundamental periodic
signal is the sinewave that we
already have seen.
So let's generate a sine
wave of 500 hertz,
duration of 5 seconds and
amplitude of 0.8.
Okay.
So here is our sinewave.
Let's hear it.
[SOUND] Okay.
In order to see that it's periodic,
we can zoom into it.
And here we see
the sinusoidal oscillation,
the periodic oscillation of a sinewave.
If we zoom even more,
we're going to start seing the samples
that are present in this signal.
This is a discrete signal.
So we have generated this
signal at 44,100 hertz.
So we'll have that many
samples per second.
Okay.
So the first thing we might want to do
to understand the concept of
periodicity is to measure what
is the period length, 
the idea of periodic means that
there is a period that is repeating,
a cycle of the sound.
So this is a cycle of this sinusoid
and in here we can see what is
the length of the selection I made and
it says that it is 0.002, so
that means 2 milliseconds.
If we go to the terminal and have Python
in, we can use it as a calculator.
So we can convert this period
length into frequency.
So the inverse of the period, so
1/.002 will be our frequency.
And, of course, it gives us 500 hertz,
500 hertz is the frequency
of this sinusoid.
Okay.
Another thing we might want to
check is,
okay, this period has a series of samples.
So how many samples does one
period of this sinusoid has?
Well, in order to compute that, what we
should do is start with the sampling rate.
The sampling rate is 44,100 and
multiply it by the duration of this period.
So, we multiply it by 0.002 and
it gives me 88.2, which is
the number of samples of a period.
Of course,
it should be an integer number, so
I guess it's going to be
88 samples in one period.
Okay?
Now let's generate another sinusoid
but of a different frequency.
So letâ€™s, maybe, open a new file.
Okay.
And let's create another sinusoid.
But instead of 500 hertz,
let's put, for example, 5,000 hertz.
Okay.
So this is the sinusoid of 5,000 hertz.
We can hear it too.
[SOUND] Okay, clearly much higher.
And we can also zoom and
see the periodicity.
But here,
we already see that it's not so nice.
In fact, the samples are not really
shaping a smooth sinusoidal functions.
This is because there are less
samples per period, therefore,
we don't have a very smooth version.
So how many samples are in one period?
Well, not that many.
In fact here we can even count them.
And it's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.
So, in fact, we have like eight,
nine, samples per one period.
Not exactly because they don't coincide,
of course, with a period.
Of course it makes sense because if
we had seen that the frequency of
500 had 88 samples in one period,
now that we have
ten times the frequency, 5,000, the number
of samples will be ten times less.
So it's going to be around eight or
nine samples.
That's pretty good.
Of course, this relationship
between the number of samples and
the frequency is a very important one,
and related with the sampling rate.
The bigger the sampling rate, of course,
more samples we'll have and for
higher frequencies
we'll have more samples.
At 44,100, as we go up in frequency,
and if we go even higher,
like 10,000 or even 15,000,
the number of samples will be very less.
And, therefore,
the shapes will not look like
a sinusoid even though it's a sinusoid.
Okay.
Let's look at another periodic signal but
different from a sinusoid.
So we will create a new file and
we will generate a tone.
But in this case, let's generate,
for example, a sawtooth.
And, instead of 5,000,
let's go back to the 500 hertz.
And maybe the amplitude, we do not have to
put it that high because this is
a very rich sound and
it will be quite loud otherwise.
Okay.
So this is a sawtooth waveform.
Again, we can now listen to it.
[SOUND] Okay?
If we zoom in into this waveform,
well, we see that it's very periodic.
And since the sampling rate is high
enough and the frequency is kind of low,
we can, if we zoom in, well,
we have a lot of samples per period.
But in this case, the period, which we can
measure and it's going to be same thing,
500, it doesn't mean that there
is one frequency at 500 hertz.
In fact,
this waveform has many frequencies.
It has 500 hertz as
the fundamental frequency, and
it has multiples of that so
that it's a harmonic sound.
And how can we check that?
Well, we check that
with spectrum analysis.
And in Audacity, we have
the possibility to plot the spectrum.
Okay.
And here,
now it tells me that there is not
enough data because I have to
choose a bigger part of the sound.
So, let's choose a bigger
fragment of the sound.
And now, if we replot, now we can
visualize the spectrum of this sawtooth.
And clearly, we see that is a quite
complex spectrum in which it
has many peaks.
In order to understand this,
I think it's good to compare it
with the sinusoid we started with.
So this was the sine wave we started and
if we do the same thing that we have done
now with the sawtooth, that is to compute
the spectrum, well, we see now
that it's clearly very different.
The, the spectrum of a sinusoid has only
one major peak at the frequency,
in this case, 500.
And the spectrum of
the sawtooth has many peaks,
which correspond to all the frequencies
present in this harmonic signal.
Okay.
Now let's even do something
a little bit more complicated.
Let's see that we can generate one signal.
But instead of being the same
frequency all the time,
let's have it that it changes in time.
So these are normally
called chirp functions.
So let's have a sine wave being a chirp.
Let's go from the two
frequencies we have mentioned.
So from 500, let's go up to 5,000 hertz.
And let's have the amplitude as 0.8 all
the time and let's have this 5 seconds.
So now, we have kind of a glissando,
a chirp.
And, of course, we can play it again.
[SOUND] Okay.
So it's a frequency that goes up and
again we, of course,
we can zoom but we will see that
the period keeps changing in time.
So here at the beginning,
we'll have a period that
is going to be quite long.
It will be the 500 hertz,
the 2 milliseconds.
And by the end, it will be much smaller,
it will be ten times smaller.
Okay.
And, of course, we can visualize that by
analyzing the spectrum of this signal.
So if we select a portion of
the beginning and analyze the spectrum,
we will see that it has
around 500 hertz frequency.
And if we go to the end, so we go to
the end of the signal, here.
And now we compute the,
replot the spectrum, well, it has shifted.
It's going towards the 5,000 hertz, so
it's it's also one single peak but
much higher.
Okay.
And that's that's a good way
to visualize and
understand periodic signals.
Okay.
anyway, this is all what I wanted to
say today about periodic signals.
So let's go back to the slides.
And we haven't used much.
We've basically used Audacity.
And we have talked about
electronic periodic
signals synthesized periodic signals.
These are signals that are quite
good to play around with because we
know how we generate them.
And so, therefore, when we analyze them,
we know what to expect.
So in the next demo class
we will complicate that.
So we will actually analyze more complex
signals, sounds, that might have
some part of the periodic, might have
some part that are not periodic, so
they reflect more of
the reality of real sounds.
So I hope to see you next class.
Thank you very much.
