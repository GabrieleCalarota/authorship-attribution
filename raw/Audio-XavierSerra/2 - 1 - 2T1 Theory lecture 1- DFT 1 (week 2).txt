Welcome again to the course on audio
signal processing for music applications.
In this lecture,
I start with our most fundamental topic,
The Discrete Fourier Transform.
If you can follow and
understand this topic you should have no
problem in following the whole course.
I divided the topic into two lectures,
so this is the, the first one.
We'll start with the Discrete
Fourier Transform equation, and
then explain the two basic
components of the equation.
What are the complex exponentials and
the scalar product?
So this is it.
This is the most important equation
to be shown in the whole course, so
pay attention.
In the equation you can see x of n,
which is our input signal,
our series of samples of a sound.
That is multiplied by
a complex exponential.
That's a complex sinusoid.
And we multiply sample by sample.
So we have one sample of our sound, and
we multiply it by one sample
of the complex sinusoid.
And then we sum over, capital N,
which is the number of samples we compute.
And then as a result, we obtain
capital X of k which is our spectrum.
Okay and the,
the index k refers to the frequency index.
So we have capital N frequencies,
their output
which is the result of computing
capital n samples of the input.
Okay, so n is our discrete time index,
k is our discrete frequency index,
and then if we want to understand the,
these frequencies as radian frequencies,
we have to multiply k by 2 pi and
divide it by n, which is our
exponent in the complex exponential.
And then if we want to convert
these to frequency in hertz,
if we have the k index
divided by capital N and
we multiply by the sampling rate,
we obtained the frequency in hertz.
Okay, so let's see an example, our x of n
is this top plot which is in this case
a series of samples of an oboe sound and
then when we compute the DFT we obtain
this complex function capital X that
can be expressed in polar coordinates, can
be expressed with a magnitude and a phase.
But let's first hear the sound.
[SOUND] Okay.
So this is the oboe sound.
And the spectrum we can
see the magnitude and
the phase, and in the magnitude we can
identify the harmonics of this sound.
So these peaks that we see basically
reflect the harmonics of this oboe sound,
which is clearly a very harmonic sound.
And in the phase spectrum, we can see
basically the phase, how these sinusoids
are placed within the sort
of the cycle length and
with respect, in radians, with respect to
the duration of these series of samples.
As we said, in the DFT equation,
the input signal
x is multiplied by a series of complex
exponentials, complex sine waves.
The sine waves are the basis
functions on the DFT,
the components that we will identify and
measure in the input signal.
One of these complex sine waves is S of k,
in which we're using Euler's Identity, we
can express it as a complex exponential,
e to the minor j2 pi kn
divided by capital N, and
this is equal to the cosine of the same
value minus j sine of this same frequency.
So the real and imaginary part
of these complex exponential.
If we have a DFT of size N equal 4,
we will have
n samples in the input signal,
and therefore in the sine waves,
and will have four frequencies that's
going to be also the output of the DFT.
Therefore, we'll have four
sine waves of length four.
One will be at frequency zero,
if S sub zero, which will be
basically the frequency equal to zero and
it will be all equal ones.
Then s sub one will be the frequency one,
and
that will be one cycle
of a complex sine wave.
S2 will be frequency k equal two, and
s sub three will be k equal three.
So, our signal of size n equal
4 will be projected into
these four sine waves,
which each one being of size 4.
If the signal has size n equal 8, we will
need eight sine waves like these ones.
So here we have the eight complex
sine waves starting with S
sub 0 with these DC component
of being a constant.
S sub 1, which will have this one
period of a sine and of a cosine,
and we will keep increasing
the number of of periods.
But, as you can see there is kind of some
symmetry and the, the frequency doesn't
go up to eight periods, but
it really goes back to the one period.
We'll talk about that.
These are basically the eight
complex sine waves that
are used when we take a DFT of size 8.
Okay so, the DFT equation can also
be expressed by this equation,
which emphasizes the idea of a scalar
product in which we are doing
the scalar product of x of n, our input
signal, by the n complex exponentials.
And we will put an example of we
take again, size n equal 4, and
we take a signal of being these
four sample, 1, minus 1, 1, minus 1.
And we do the scalar product
of the signal by every one of
the four sine waves that we had
computed in the previous slides.
We will compute the DFT result.
So when we do the scalar product of x
by S sub zero, the result will be zero.
That will mean that this particular signal
has no frequency zero, is not present.
And then if we change to S sub one, and
we do the scalar product,
we get the same result, zero.
Which again means that this frequency
is not present in the, this x signal.
But, when we change to S sub 2, and
we do the scalar product, the result is 4.
Which means that basically this
x signal is this sinusoid,
is completely present in this sinusoid and
we get the result of four which
is the sum of all the samples.
And then by S sub three
again is equal to zero.
So that means that we have computed
the DFT of x of n and we have obtained
that is equal to 4 for k equal to 2,
and is equal to 0 for the rest.
Meaning that we have the presence
of the frequency k equal to 2.
Let's do that with a bigger signal.
So, this is an example of the scalar
operation of a simple signal that has
all ones, it has eight samples.
The first four are 1s and
the last four are minus 1s.
So this would be like a
rectangular kind of signal.
If we compute the DFT or the scalar
product between this x signal and
the eight complex sine waves that
we had seen in the previous slide,
the result will be this one.
We will get the magnitude and the phase.
It's going to be a complex spectrum and
we can display it as polar coordinates.
And here we can see that in this signal
there is, some frequencies present.
The frequency k equals
zero is not present.
The frequency k equal one
is very much present, but
it also present k equals three,
and is also present k equal five and
again, it's also present k equals seven.
And the phases mean how these,
sine waves are located in
sort of in the time location.
So this is the DFT operation and
basically this is going to be the core of
all the things we're going to be doing.
You can find, more information
on the DFT on Wikipedia and,
of course in the website of, Julius Smith.
And from now on, on all our
lectures we will use some sounds,
so all will come from, Freesound, and
they can be obtained from this link.
And again the standard creative commons
and GPL licensing of the code
that we'll be using.
So we have shown and
explained the DFT equation.
I hope you realize that it
is not such a complex thing.
But even if you feel it is complex it's
use in audio signal processing is huge.
So it is worth spending some time with it.
We will continue with the DFT in
the second part of this lecture.
So thank you for your attention,
and I see you next class.
