Welcome back to the course on audio signal
processing for music applications.
In this class, in this demo class,
I want to introduce Freesound.
You already might have noticed that all
the sounds that I have been using and
the sounds that we will be using,
come from this website, from freesound.
So, it's a great resource for this course
and I want you to understand it
a little bit more
and to take advantage of
it as much as possible.
So freesound is a website that was
started at the music technology group,
at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona,
close to 10 years ago, but
the truth is that it has been maintained and
supported by a large community of
people that believe in it, that love
to play around with sounds, and that are
contributing and maintaining this website.
So let's go to the website, okay?
So here is the website.
And it's a website that already
has a huge number of sounds.
Currently it has more than 200,000 sounds
and there's a lot of activity around it, so
there is more than
50,000 people every day,
accessing, downloading sounds,
and contributing in some way or another.
But anyway, let's start using it.
So typically what you do is, in the search
menu, you will type the name of some
sounds.
So for example, let's type flute note.
Okay, and this returns the
sounds that it has found
that include these two names,
either in the tags or in the descriptions.
It has found 1,074 sounds.
So let's go, maybe, to one of these sounds.
Okay, so this is the sound of a flute,
note B4, and we can play it.
[SOUND] Okay, so typically all the
sound entries include
a description of the sound.
This one is pretty good, so
it has a description of how the sound
was recorded, and what it is,
and then it has some of the key
descriptions of the sound.
And also it has tags.
This is a very useful way for
other people to find this sound,
through different concepts that
may be related to this sound.
And here is has all the technical
information about this sound.
Let's go back to the
sound results that we found,
and here we have many other sounds.
For example even sounds that, of course,
that are
not a flute.
For example, this, ocarina sound.
But, in the description it mentions
that is a flute like sound.
If we play it.
[SOUND] The ocarina has a flute like sound.
But one way to search for sounds that is
quite interesting is through similarity,
Which in fact what this does is
analyzes all the sounds of freesound,
it analyzes the spectrum of all
these sounds and it looks for
other sounds that might have
a spectrum similar to this one.
So this ocarina sound has
a spectrum similar to this one.
So for example,
this is a one-second nose flute
[SOUND] and
yes it's sound very similar to Ocarina.
And if we play all these other sounds
the distance increases so they would be
less and less similar, but they have
a similarity with this sound.
So that's pretty good.
So let's go back to the main page and
in here also you can also search for sounds
and information through many other ways.
If you go the sounds page in here,
you can browse
through all the sounds
according to, like, the tags and
the packs, or for example, an interesting
browsing possibility is what
is called the geo-tags.
So Geo-tags are
sounds that have been
identified with a Geo-tag.
So sounds that have been recorded in a
particular location in the world
and that people have identified 
the place where this was recorded.
So you can find, if we look in Barcelona,
of course, there are a lot of
sounds from our city because we're
very active there.
This is Barcelona.
There is 2,300 sounds
coming from Barcelona.
But there are sounds
from all over the world,
and you can navigate through
these sounds this way.
So that's pretty good.
Of course once you like one
sound you can download it, so for
example in the case of
the sounds of this course
I labeled all the sounds with
a particular tag which was, asp-course.
So if we look for
a sound that has the asp-course
label, or tag, you will find them all here.
So in this case here
it has all the sounds that I
have been uploading for the course.
So [SOUND] you can play
it of course [SOUND].
But if we want to download this sound,
we can just simply click the download.
You have to be logged in, which in
my case I am already logged in.
So I can just download it,
and it will save the file in the same
format that the sound was uploaded.
So that's pretty good.
But what I want to do now is to do
the opposite, to upload a sound.
I think it's very good for
people to upload sounds in this
class that might be of relevance for
the course, or you might have a sound
that might be interesting to analyze,
or you might have a
sound that you have transformed and
that you want to share with other people.
So I encourage to upload sounds and
maybe put the same label,
asp-course, so
that other people can find your sounds.
So let's think of a sound that we might
want to upload that is not there, so for
example, let's see if there
are many sawtooth,
synthesis sounds of a sawtooth.
Ok, there are quite a few, but I don't see
the standard kind of, straight sawtooth
of high quality, here there is one which
is very weird because it's 8-bits.
Okay so let's go to audacity, and
let's generate a tone using a sawtooth.
Okay so let's select saw-tooth,
frequency 440 hertz.
And let's put an amplitude of 0.5.
And let's have five seconds of sawtooth.
Okay, so this is it.
Let's hear it.
[SOUND] Okay, so we will upload that.
Let's maybe, to make it nicer
let's add a fade in at the beginning,
a fade out at the end, okay.
And that's it.
Now we can save the file, export it.
And in the directory, let's put
sawtooth, and it's 440 Hertz.
Okay, so let's save it.
We have it.
Now from the
freesound website, we can just
click at the "upload sounds" button.
And here upload and
we'll have the sawtooth 440 hertz.
So that's ok.
It's already done.
And now what is important
is to describe the sound.
So it has the option
to describe the sound.
And here we click Describe
and we can specify tags and
description of the sound.
So, for example, for description
we can say okay, this was a sawtooth 
generated waveform, for example,
of frequency 440Hz
and of 5 seconds
generated with Audacity.
Okay.
Let's put and 5 seconds.
Okay.
And
then in terms of tags we might put,
of course the word sawtooth,
we can use 440 hertz,
440 is A4, so that's pretty good.
it is an electronic sound, it's produced with
a synthesis techniques and
let's put synth, it's quite a common word.
It's a waveform.
Okay, that should work,
so that's pretty good.
Let's just well in the pack.
These are the packs I have.
I have the synthesis pack, so
maybe let's put it there.
And the license,
there is three types of license I can use.
Creative Commons Zero,
that means public domain,
anything can be done. Attribution, that means
people have to say that it comes from
freesound, or Restrict that it
should not be used commercially.
So normally I like the Attribution.
So I will put Attribution.
And I will submit it.
And that's it.
It has already been uploaded.
And now there will be
moderators that will check if
this sound was well-described,
and it is not infringing
any legal thing.
I didn't take it from any other place.
And then it will come up in Freesound.
Okay.
That's basically what I wanted to say so
let's go back to here and okay.
So we have talked about freesound
and a very important concept
that I want to emphasize, and
that you should be familiar with
is all these licensing issues.
Creative Commons is
a great set of licenses.
And for sounds, they are very much appropriate
and freesound uses them very well.
Okay, then we have used 
Audacity to generate the sawtooth
and we have referred to this pack
in within freesound where I
keep all the sounds for the course.
And that's all so
we have introduced freesound,
hopefully this has been
of interest to you and
I encourage you to take advantage of it,
to use it, get sounds from it.
But even more.
To upload sounds, to put things that
you believe might be of interesting.
Might be interesting to the community.
And for this course you have
the oportunity to generate and
record sounds that might be
of relevance to freesound.
So anyway, thank you very much and
I hope to see you next class.
Bye-bye
