Welcome again to the course on audio signal processing for
music applications.
In this class, I want to highlight
the basic mathematic concepts that
are required to understand what
we will cover in the course.
I will not explain them in depth.
So, if you have not seen them before or,
you have already forgotten.
I strongly encourage you to go over
them by yourself as soon as possible.
In the context of this course,
sounds are discrete signals, and
the processes that we will
develop are discrete systems.
Thus we will require some
background on discrete mathematics.
The good news, is that, no cow clues
is required to follow these course.
You just have to know a little bit about
sinusoidal functions, complex numbers,
Euler's formula, complex sinusoids,
scalar product of sequences, even and
odd function and convolution.
That's not that much.
You really don't need
much more than these.
The rest we'll cover and
explain in the course.
So let me now present these concepts,
so you can identify what you
should review before really
starting into our core topics.
Our first basic concept, is the sinewave.
A sinusoidal function or
sinewave is a mathematical curve, that
describes a smooth repetitive oscillation.
It occurs often, in physics,
engineering and many other fields.
Here we see the equation of a sinewave.
x of n, which is our function.
Is equal to capital A times the cosine
of omega n capital T plus phi.
So, where A is the amplitude
of the sinewave.
Omega is the angular frequencies,
so it's expressed in radians.
And then nT is basically our time,
n is our time index and
capital T is our sampling period.
So we, we multiply n by capital T,
we obtain the t in seconds.
And then the phi is the initial phase,
also expressed in radians.
And the frequency can be
expressed also in hertz.
So to convert the omega into hertz,
we basically have to divide by 2 pi.
So omega divided by 2 pi is
equal to the frequency in hertz.
Okay, the most common visual
representation of a sine wave is this one.
So you see here a plot, in which we can
see the time in the horizontal axis.
And the amplitude in the vertical axis.
So, we can play it.
[SOUND] So this is the sound of this sinusoid,
this is the code that
generated the sinewave.
All our examples and and
plots will be generated using Python,
and all the assignments and exercises too.
So this is a very simplified code for the
sinewave in which we see the amplitude
which was 0.8. The frequency, which is 1,000 hertz.
So the frequency we heard is 1,000 hertz.
Then, there is an initial phi,
which is the initial phase at time 0.
At which time 0 is right in the middle.
And then in order to generate
the function, we need to generate a time
array, which is all the time
that we will be displaying.
So, a small t is an array that goes from
minus 0.002 seconds to 0.002 seconds but
of course sampled at the sampling rate
at fs and this is the equation
that we actually type into Python
to generate the sinewave.
Okay, so another needed basic
concept is the one of complex numbers,
which are numbers that
are built of two parts.
One part is what we call real part,
and the other is the imaginary part.
So a would be the real part, and
b would be the imaginary part.
In order to, to represent imaginary part,
we multiply by j, which is the imaginary unit.
is the square root of minus 1.
So jb composes the imaginary part.
And then these number, these complex
numbers are normally represented in
what we call the complex plane.
Shown here.
In which the real part is
the horizontal axis,
so it's plotted on the horizontal axis.
And the imaginary part, the b value,
is plotted in the vertical axis.
And then we normally have this circle,
which is magnitude one.
So this is what we call the unit circle.
And here are all the complex
numbers that have magnitude 1.
A complex number can be
expressed in two ways,
in what we call rectangular form or
in polar form.
The rectangular form is the most
direct form, in which we explicitly
express the a value, the real part,
and b, the imaginary value.
And therefore the intersection of
these two values in the complex plane
with this cross, is the actual complex number.
In polar form, what we do is we
consider this complex number,
this cross, as the tip of
the vector with origin at (0, 0).
Therefore as a vector it has
a magnitude which is capital A.
That can be computed from a and b, as
the square root of the sum of the squares.
And then it also has an angle, and
also can be computed from a and
b by computing the inverse
tangent of b over a.
The polar form representation
makes the sum and
multiplication operations of
complex numbers more intuitive.
For us, that will be a great advantage.
And we will use the polar form
representation of complex numbers and
functions whenever possible.
Now let's combine sines and
complex numbers.
Euler's equations establishes
a very useful relationship between
rectangular and
polar co-ordinates of a complex number.
So the number e to the j phi,
which is a complex exponential,
can be expressed as the sum
of a cosine plus a sine.
A real part, cosine phi,
plus an imaginary part, j sine phi.
And we can go back and
forth in the two directions.
So we can start from,
from the complex exponential and
obtain the, the real part, cosine phi.
Or the imaginary part, sin phi,
and the other way around.
It's a nice looking formula, and in fact
the physicist Richard Feynman.
Call this equation the, the most
remarkable formula in, in mathematics.
If we show this in the, in the complex
plane, in this diagram that we show here,
we can see these components
that we mentioned.
So we see the complex value
as the e to the j phi.
Which seems, has magnitude 1,
is in the unit circle.
And we can see the, the real part and
the imaginary part.
One being the real part, cosine phi.
And the imaginary part being sine phi.
So this formula will be
fundamental to understand the,
Discrete Fourier Transform,
we will come back to it later.
Now by using sinusoids, complex numbers,
and what we just have seen,
the Euler's formula,
we can introduce complex sinusoids.
So in, in this case the function x of n,
with a bar is a complex sinusoid.
So it can be expressed with this complex
exponential that we just introduced.
And there are several ways to
represent the same
function using this Eular's identity.
So please go through this equation and
make sure that you understand it.
We'll normally be working
with real signals.
That's real sinusoids.
And we'll have to go
from complex sinusoids,
the ones that Fourier Transform work with,
to real sinusoids.
So in here,
we see the equation of a real sinusoid.
That we saw before.
So, capital A amplitude times
the cosine of omega nt plus phi.
Acos(ωnT+φ)
As can be expressed with the sum
of complex sinewaves, okay?
So, complex sinewave,
if we sum two of them.
Can generate a real sinewave.
In fact that seems too complicated and
not so intuitive but
it's a, it's a very useful
mathematical trick that Fourier uses,
that in the Fourier transform we
need to be able to understand.
So that basically says that
summing two complex sinewaves,
we can cancel the imaginary components
of the sinusoids and keep the real part,
which is what we are normally
going to be interested in.
To plot the complex sinewave is not easy.
We would need to, to show it in 3D space.
And a common alternative
is to plot the real and
imaginary components as
two separate functions.
So in here, we see the real and
imaginary sinusoids.
So the, in blue is the real part,
so it's a cosine.
And in green, is the imaginary part,
so is a sine function.
And that's how we're going to be
plotting these complex sinewaves.
Another concept to be familiar with is,
the scalar or
dot product, a common algebraic
operation between sequences.
This is an operation that takes two
equal length sequences of numbers.
And returns a single value.
This operation can be defined either
geometrically or algebraically.
And, algebraically, it's the sum of the
products of the corresponding entries of
the two sequences of numbers,
as is shown here.
So we have the sequence x, sequence y.
And we just sum over the sample to sample
product of each of these sequences.
And we can show it in an example.
So we have an example x
of n simple sequence,
and y of n, another simple sequence,
complex sequences.
Their dot product will be the point to
point multiplication of
these two sequences.
However, the second
sequence is conjugated.
So we see here the minus j of
the second sequence because we
we conjugated the j of
the second sequence.
And then if we do the whole operation,
we obtain a number.
So the scalar product means
that we return a single number
after doing the operation
with two sequences.
An important property of
the scalar product is
that when two sequences are orthogonal.
Their scalar product is equal to 0.
So here we see this concept.
x is orthogonal to y, if and
only if the scalar product
of x times y is equal to 0.
So geometrically the dot product can
be understood as the projection of one
sequence into another, and maybe this
diagram we can see this concept.
So we have two sequences,
very short sequences.
One is composed of the values 2 and 2, and
the other is composed of the value 2 and
minus 2, which in the two-dimensional
space are orthogonal.
I mean, we see them one being
perpendicular to the other.
So, and we can prove that.
By doing the dot product of x times y and so
if we do this operation as shown here,
we can prove that is equal to 0.
So the dot product of
these two sequences is 0.
And this is a basic operation
that is performed by
the Discrete Fourier Transform.
Another mathematical concept, that will
appear in our signal analysis operations,
is the one of even and odd functions.
So function is even if
the negative part of the function,
so you would say f of minus n.
Is equal to f of n.
So, that is what we call
a symmetric function.
An odd function is when f of minus
n is equal to the minus f of n.
And this is what we call,
an antisymmetric signal.
So the case of the two functions that
we have been talking about, cosines and
sines, very much exemplify these
two types of of properties.
A cosine is an even function because it's
symmetric around the origin,
about the point 0.
And the sine is an odd function,
because is antisymmetric.
Around 0, we have this antisymmetry, okay?
So this is going to be also
relevant in some of the things we
will be talking about.
The last concept we want to mention
is one of convolution of sequences.
This is a mathematical operation of two
sequences, producing a third sequence that
can be viewed as a modified version
of one of the original sequences.
Here we see, the equation of convolution.
I don't have time to go into detail,
but please try to understand it.
And also we can see it graphically if
we have these two sequences x sub 1
x sub 2 that have different shapes,
the resulting sequence the,
the convolve result,
is a much smoother function.
And it's a quite kind of
a combination of these two sequences.
So convolution is,
is similar to cross correlation.
It's a common operation used to
implement filtering of sounds.
And it's also useful to understand
Several of the properties of
the Fourier transform.
So the concepts I highlighted in this
lecture are extensively covered in
many text books.
Most of the references I
use come from Wikipedia and
from the website of Julius Smith.
On the mathematics of Discrete Fourier
Transform reference that I
very much recommend that you go through.
So if you want to have more information in
Wikipedia, I have highlighted some
of the relevant entries and the,
the website of Julius for the book.
And again the standard attribution of
all the content that I
am using in this course.
And this all for this lecture.
We have identified the basic
mathematic concepts that will be
very much needed throughout the course.
Please make sure that you get a grasp of
them before we start Fourier topics.
Thanks for your attention.
