Let's look at some of
the advantages of functions.
First off, functions allow you to
break down large complex problems
into smaller more manageable subproblems.
And a typical computer program
consists of many such functions,
each of which solves one subproblem.
An analogy can be drawn from real life.
Suppose you buy a table from IKEA.
Well, it's assembly guy might describe
how to put together one leg in detail.
Then instead of repeating that description
three times, it'll just say, and
I do this for the three remaining legs.
Saying do this three times is similar
to calling a function three times, and
it's much more efficient than repeating
the description or repeating the code.
In particular,
functions that you decide to write
has a great impact on your program.
In general, you should try to group
together closely related tasks
into a common function.
And tasks that are not related
should go into separate functions.
The process of breaking down a complex
problem into smaller ones is called
functional decomposition.
And mastering the art of decomposition
will help you become a good programmer.
There are many advantages to functions.
For example, there are whole sets
of functions called libraries that
are available on the internet with so
called open source licensing,
meaning you can modify them,
you can use them in your own programs for
any purpose including selling them.
Using functions that other people have
written in your own programs is sometimes
called code reuse.
And code reuse helps you
avoid reinventing the wheel.
Also a function typically solves, not
just a single instance of a problem, but
a general set of related problems.
It does this by accepting varying
values for its input arguments.
The built-in function SQRT for
example, computes the square root of
any number or any matrix of numbers.
The built-in function plot can generate
an infinite number of different plots
depending on it's input.
Even our little my-ran function has
a considerable degree of generality.
These advantages to functions are so
great.
And most MATLAB programmers put all
the code they write inside them.
And we're going to get lots of practice
in this course doing just that.
