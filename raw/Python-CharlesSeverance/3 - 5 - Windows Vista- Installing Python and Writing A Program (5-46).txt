Hello, and welcome to our How to Use
Notepad to Run Python Applications.
This is part of my open and
free textbook, Python for Informatics:
Exploring Information.
At this point, you should have, hopefully
by now, installed Python.
If you haven't yet installed Python,
you can go,
My book is really any Python 
version 2 is fine,
 2.5, 2.6, ,2.7.
The simplest thing to do is to go down to
this link right here which is the Windows
x86 MSI installer.
If you're in doubt as to whether or not
you're a Windows 64
or x 32 bit, just go ahead and grab the
32 bit.
Download it, run it.
I won't go through that here.
It's straightforward.
It's pretty much the same as running most
install packages.
The other thing that you're going to
want to install is a programmer editor.
I recommend Notepad Plus for Windows users.
You really don't want to use Notepad.
It will mess up your programs
and turn them
into various things and 
not save them the right way.
So we just want a programmer
editor that understands programs, that's
going to, it'll
be good for HTML, it'll be good for CSS,
good for lots of things.
So, again, download that.
There's a couple of ways.
You can just go Notepad Plus and
Google
and find it and download it 
and install it.
But I'm going to assume that you've done
both of those things.
So now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you how to run the program,
assuming you've installed these two
things.
So lets go ahead and start Notepad Plus
Plus.
I've already got it here.
And there we go.
So now I'm going to write my first Python
program.
[SOUND].
Print, "hello world", world.
I'm not a very good typer.
Okay.
So then what we got to do is, I've got to
save it somewhere.
So we're going to run this.
This is just editing a file, so 
I'm going to save it.
Save As, and I'm going to put it on to
my desktop, and I'm going to name the file
firstprog.py.
Now you might want to put this in a
folder.
If you are going to be using, please don't
put names in your folders, okay?
I mean spaces in your folders.
So I can put this in a folder but I'm
going to put it in
my desktop, so the saving shows up right
here. It is indeed on my desktop.
Now to actually run this we are going to
run it through the command line.
There are many ways to do this but I
prefer running it through the command
line so you really get a sense of control
rather than clicking on things and
So, so this is this version of Windows I
have to start a command prompt CMD.
I start CMD, sometimes it's start run CMD
depending on your Windows, but
one way or another you get this little
black and white beautiful little screen.
And where I am at is telling me the
current directory.
I'm in the C drive>Users>ScreenCaster.
That's my home directory. And I can 
go one folder
down to go into my desktop.
And when I am in my desktop in this
window, it's the same as here.
So if I do a dir, which is the command to
list the files,
I see first firstprog.py sitting in the exact
same place that I am.
Okay?
So the way that you run this is you simply
type firstprog.py at the command line.
We are going to run a Python program and
Python sort of understands, Windows
understands that files that end with a
suffix .py are Python programs.
And so,
here is my first program.
But it's saying I've got a syntax error.
It says something, something, something
Print hello world, let me look at
this more closely, print oh, oh, oh, I
should have called that print.
Oh.
And there we go, we see syntax
highlighting, so
now i am going to save this, 
oops, File, Save.
Now here is a little trick that 
you can do. Seeing as how
I just typed firstprog.py, and I
want to run the same command again,
I just hit the up arrow.
And it automatically knows what my
previous command is.
You can scroll thru these things.
A way to go.
firstprog.py.
Okay, that works a little better.
It says Hello world now.
So you just basically will write,
Second.
You know.
Your do stuff here in your Python and you
will save it.
Save it.
And then you'll hit the up arrow and run
it.
And there we go.
I'm, I'm changing.
So, this is a Python program.
It's stored both on your desktop, and here
you can run it.
Okay?
So that is basically, the, the, the idea
of how this, how this works and,
Oh, let me show you one more thing.
Sorry, I was checking my notes.
If you want to run the Python interpreter
interactively, you have to type its full
path.
C, colon, in my case I've got python two
seven installed here.
python 27 backslash python dot exe.
Oh, I didn't do that very well.
But here
I can type the up arrow and I type exe.
And so now I'm at the chevron prompt.
And so I can say like print.
Yo, I can say, x equals 5.
Print 5.
Now to get out of the chevron prompt,
you either type quit with parentheses
or Ctrl+Z and I will type Ctrl+XZ to exit.
And that exits
the Python interpreter, the interactive
mode of Python, okay?
Thanks a lot, bye
