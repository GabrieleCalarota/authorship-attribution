Hello and welcome to the podcast on
how to screen capture on Windows,
Microsoft Windows Vista.
So, this is pretty easy actually, because
there's a
program does it on Windows Vista, the
snipping tool.
So let's just say I wanted to take a
picture of this JEdit running right here.
It doesn't really matter.
So, I am going to write hit the Start
button and type snip.
And there is the Snipping tool.
And so, I will launch the Snipping tool.
Sure I'll, I like launching adding
Snipping tool to my quick launch bar.
And basically, it's telling me here that
the Snipping tool is
kind of grayed out the rest of the screen,
and it's allowing
me to do several kinds of snips, a
free-form snip
where I draw with my cursor, a rectangular
snip, or a window snip.
Probably the most effective is
a window snip so I'll select Window Snip.
Changes my cursor and it says, take that.
Now, I'm going to throw that away.
Oh, wait a sec.
I'm going to just say do this again.
Where did that show up?
Switch desktop.
Where's the snipping, Speedy Snipping
tool, there.
Now, all right, again.
Snipping tool.
Okay.
So one thing you'll probably want to do
before you go snipping is change the
options.
And see how this ink selection?
It's cool while you're cruising around
figuring out which window, but once you
take the snip, I don't quite know why they
default this to on.
So turn off Show ink selection after
snips are captured.
Then say OK.
And then say, I would like to do a window
snip.
And now it's showing me which window it's
snipping,
and you'll notice how I change between
them, and
I click on the window I'd like, and now
I don't get this funky red around the
outside.
And I simply say Save As. I'm going to put
it on my desktop just for yucks.
Instead of in pictures, you can stick it
anywhere, my snip and I want it
to be JPG, that's going to make perfect
sense, and it's saving it and now I can
close the snip program. And son of a gun, if I
have something being snipped and
grabbed and you can click on it here and open
it up in the picture viewer.
Just to make sure, come on, picture viewer
[BLANK_AUDIO]
I don't understand why the picture viewer
is
not starting. Well, there we go. 
So there is
is the picture viewer and so 
it looks pretty nice, and
so if you were to have to turn this in
Now, we've got a bunch of these because I
clicked so many times.
If you have to turn this in, you just
upload this file. And that's
pretty much all it takes to do screen
capture in Windows Vista, very nice.
