Hello and welcome to our first assignment,
writing the classic Hello World program.
We do this Hello World program to some
degree to
sort of prove that we can get ourselves
inside the computer.
I think of Hello World as putting
ourselves in
the computer and then having ourselves
talk back to us.
The version of us inside the computer
talking back.
So I think it's a interesting
philosophical question.
So I'm going to show you how to use our
autograder.
This program is a one-line program, so
it's really easy, so
you can kind of get used to doing how the
autograder is.
I really want you to do the optional
assignment of installing Python on your
desktop or your laptop, so you can do the
programs on your desktop or your laptop.
because I think you're going to learn a
lot more when you do that.
And as you look at some of the future
videos that I
do for the assignments, I do them all on
the desktop, right?
I, I, I hope that if you're reading those,
you actually learn something about
how to program the desktop, even if you
choose not to do it yourself.
And you'll find that sort of as 
the class starts,
the exercise videos are exactly what
you're doing for homework.
And then they slowly but surely 
sort of move
away and you have increasing
responsibility for writing the code.
Now don't just work from the homework
backwards.
Because if you do you're, you're going to
cheat yourself.
Because all of a sudden, about the sixth
week, you'll be like, I don't know
anything.
And the answer is, well, that's because
you took
the easy way out in the first five weeks.
And then the right thing to do is 
to start over and try it
again, but then be more disciplined the
first time through, and actually learn the
material.
So,
so let's wait a sec, oh yeah, I gotta, I'm
wearing my cool Coursera t-shirt.
And I'm probably the only teacher that
you've got
that has a really cool Coursera tattoo
along with
all the other tools that have to do with
teaching and learning technology, which is
my research area.
And we're going to be using Learning Tools
Interoperability in my research to do all
this stuff.
So, at this point you're probably 
watching this
video right there, the Turn in Hello World
video.
And so each of the autograder assignments
is going to be in Video Lectures.
That's why I call it Video Lectures and
Autograder Links.
And so, you click this. And when you click
this it's going
to open the autograder up in a new window,
a new tab.
You see now I have two tabs. And so this
is a piece of software that I wrote.
You can see that the URL has changed.
This is a server that I control.
And it, it contains a simple 
JavaScript-based Python interpreter.
So you're running this code actually right
in your browser.
And so there's a little editor place.
You can use this to edit your programs.
For the first few, it will be fine.
And it saves all your data, so that's
fine.
But as the programs get longer and
longer and
your output gets longer and longer it's a
little painful.
So, the, the idea here is we have the
program that you're supposed to write.
Write a program that uses a print
statement to say "hello world" as shown
below.
We have the output you're supposed to
achieve.
And, then, here's the output of your
program.
And so to run it, you type Check Code.
And so, what this is saying is, oh,
something's wrong on line one.
And so, I will, I'll fix the mistake
because this is supposed to be a t.
And then I'll make different mistake 
where I
change this to Hello world with capitals,
right?
So now I'm going to run this program.
It's going to actually work.
And you'll see that it runs, but I don't
match.
This is what this mismatch and it's
saying, please correct your code and
rerun.
Now, I'm going to, I'm just going to press
Done for a moment to show you something.
So I've left, and now I'm going to 
go back in.
And if you'll notice, it stored my code,
right?
And, and so it remembers the code that,
the
last code that you've done the Check Code
on.
And and I can run check code again.
And, of course, I get the mismatch.
And then, when I finally get it right by
getting this h to
be a lower case h and then I check code
and it's done.
And then it sends the grade 
automatically back
up to Coursera and so Coursera 
has your grade.
And then you press Done.
Now what's nice is at any point in time
later in the class, you
can come back and you can take a look at
the code that you wrote.
You can even replay, play it again.
You can sort of cut and paste and save it
to your hard drive.
I might need to write a little download
gadget so
that you can actually download it to your
hard drive.
But so that's pretty much, oh, the, the
last
I forgot to show you is this Reset Code
button.
you'll, it stores the code that you wrote.
If you type Reset Code, it says, are you
want to
reset the code that I provided you in the
first place?
And so, if I say OK here, it goes back
to code that has the mistake.
And so, that's pretty much it.
Like I said, I encourage you to try to use
your own laptop to do
the programming and then cut and paste
your working programs into here to test
them.
But I fully understand if you decide to
use your cell phone to do all the
programs.
It'll be a little tired typing all the
programs in on your cell phone.
But, but of course, you can do that.
So again welcome to class.
