Hello and welcome to yet another Worked
Exercise from Python for Informatics
Exploring Information.
My name is Charles Severance and I am your
exercise coach.
I'm your personal trainer, your personal
assistant.
Welcome to the software development gym.
This material, of course, is copyright
Creative
Commons as is the textbook as well.
So just make sure when you're using these
exercises that you're using them properly,
particularly if you're taking this class
and you have an
assignment that includes this exercise,
you probably should try it first.
I mean, these exercises are there so that
you learn the material and if you just
sort of, take the crutch every time,
then you
won't learn the, to do things on your own.
So enough of that lecturing.
Other details you can get from
pythonlearn.com.
So today we're contemplating exercise 6.9
and our goal is
to write some code, to parse lines that
start with this, something
blah blah blah blah, colon, and then we're
going to chop off
the second half and convert it to a
floating point number.
In a later chapter we'll do this in a
loop, but for now we're
just going to like hack one line and just
see what, what it looks like, okay?
And so, so this one's kind of a
silly one but
we'll do it, we'll do it anyway.
So this one, let's grab this string while
we're at it and start up TextWrangler.
Oh, the last exercise is still there.
Start TextWrangler and start the Terminal
program.
In my Terminal program, I'll go to my
desktop,
I'll go to Python for informatics folder,
and I'll paste that string in
and I'm just going to call
my string x for now and put
this in a string.
Later, you'll be reading this
from a file but
this exercise is not to read
anything from a file.
This exercise is just to parse that
string.
So it's going to be pretty simple.
I will print x just for yucks.
We could make it so it would
prompt for this string in a
loop or something like that but we'll,
we'll leave that for now.
We're just going to, our job is just
hacking and slashing.
So the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to use the find function
in the string library.
We've got to make a variable called position
and we're going to say x dot find colon.
It's like, where is that colon at?
Print position.
And we're going to save
this guy as spamchop.py
And, of course, the colors change and
we do an ls and here's spamchop.py
So it's python spamchop.py, and again
there's no input here.
Try that again, spamchop.py.
So there we go.
That basically says that the position of
this letter is in position 18.
So the next thing we're going to do is
we're going
to just sort of say, okay, let's chop off
the first part.
print x and we're going to use string
slicing, p-o-s colon,
which says start at position and
move to the end.
So I'll save that one and I'll run it and
that looks pretty close.
We got rid of most of it but we still
don't, we still have the colon.
So we gotta chop off one after the
position of the colon.
We actually are not interested
in the colon.
So we just add one here and then we go,
spamchop.
Now, we're going to see if the
float cares about this.
I don't think so but we'll find out. 
num equals float
and I'm just going to say
x of position plus 1
because I can give it an expression here,
to the end, and let's see what happens.
print num.
So what do you think is going to happen?
Think it's going to work?
Think it's going to blow up?
Think these spaces at the front are
going to freak it out?
Let's find out.
No.
The spaces don't freak it out.
So we now have a number and if I did, if I
did a print of type,
which is to be sort of like
obsessively compulsive,
you couldd say num comma, type 
of num, and so
proven to me, and I can, I can
comment these guys out.
We don't need those guys anymore.
And that is a floating point number and
it's all parsed and it's cool.
I mean it's pretty simple, right?
You go find where this thing is, advance
one character beyond it, and then
slice it out.
Simple enough.
Thanks for your time.
