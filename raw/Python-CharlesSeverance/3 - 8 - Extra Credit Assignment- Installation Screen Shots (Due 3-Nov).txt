Hello, and welcome to the optional extra
credit assignment for Python for
Everybody, Week 1.
I really want to encourage you to follow
through the scripts, install Python, and
write
your first simple one-line program, using
a text editor and a command line.
I really think that you're going to learn
a lot from this, not just, you know, how to
program, but how to use your computer in
a sort of a more professional way.
Now if you're using a phone or an iPad, you
can't do it.
And that's okay.
But if you're using a laptop, I'd like to
see you
learn a little bit more about how to use
that laptop.
And so this what you'll do is, you'll do,
do, write the program.
Take two screen shots.
One of the text editor and one of
the program being run, and then you'll
upload them.
This is a peer grading system that I
wrote and host on my own server and
it's supposed to make it so that you can,
you know, peer grade really quickly.
So, let's assume that you have your your
two screenshots.
You go here.
Now the one thing you'll notice is it asks
you this course
utilizes third-party learning
tools
from service providers LTI Tools,
dr-chuck.com.
You're sharing your data with these third
parties.
That third party is me, in this case.
And this is really good.
Coursera is making sure that I'm not
getting your data unless you want it.
So you say OK, and then you continue to
my server, external server.
And it gives now the [COUGH] what you're
supposed to do.
Install the Python, write a Hello World
program, take some screen shots,
yada, yada.
And then what you do is when you have
those screen shots, you upload those.
So, I'm going to grab, I've already this,
of course.
I'm going to grab a second file, and I can
put some
comments, I am using a Mac or something,
whatever you want to say.
And then you submit, and when you submit
you can see your submissions.
You're not allowed to remove your
submissions once the process started.
And if there are other students to grade,
you get to grade the other students.
And your, part of your grade comes from
you doing grading,
and another part of the grade comes from
others grading you.
And so you'll get six points for the
grades that you get from
others, and you'll get four points for the
grades you give to others.
You've got to grade at least two
submissions, you can grade up to five
submissions.
So I'll just, it'll randomly pick another
student to grade.
So here we go, I'm going to, I'm going to
take a look
at this person's things, and like okay,
there's, there's their Python.
That looks pretty good, and then there is
their editor.
That looks pretty good.
So I'm going to give this person six
points, and say love
the pics and then grade it.
And I've graded one student, and I could
grade, if I wanted, another student.
So, I will grade another student.
And let's see who this one is.
This is, well, this is oh, this is another
version of me.
That's my instructor account so and so
there we go, session.
Yours shouldn't say "hello Dr. Chuck", it
should say "hello you" and so
I'll give myself six points nice work,
instructor Chuck.
Grade.
Now.
No one has graded it.
So I got 40 percent as my grade.
I just have to stop, right.
I have to quit because there is no one else,
I mean I've graded everything I can grade.
I can grade more students up to five, and
I
just have to wait till others come and
grade me.
But the grade will come back in, once they
grade me.
So, you know, in maybe 20 minutes or an
hour, or whatever.
Someone will grade mine, and my grade will
go up, okay?
And that's it, and when you're all done,
you gotta close the window.
And go check your grade in the grade book.
At this point you should have a 0.4 but as
the
grades, others evaluate you, your grade'll
go up to point one.
So, it shouldn't take you very long to get
all the way up to point one.
And so, that's my little really
lightweight, I call it a social
peer grading system that you should get
feedback within an hour or so.
I use it for like check-off
assignments, just
to make sure that you pretty much did it
right.
There was, you saw it was really easy to
grade and real easy to take a look at
them.
So, I think this is a fun way to
grade assignments and you should get
really quick feedback.
