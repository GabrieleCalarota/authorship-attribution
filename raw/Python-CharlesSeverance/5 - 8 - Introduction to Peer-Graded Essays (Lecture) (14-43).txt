Hello.
And welcome to our short little 
lecture on peer grading assignments.
Since this is often a 
first class for people
on Coursera and peer grading assignments
may be something that
are seen differently in different
cultures, I figure I'll
just do a little bit of a lecture on that.
First off, they're extra credit.
They're completely optional.
I understand that non-English speakers 
may not want to participate.
And that's okay.
And you can earn all the credit 
in the class just
by doing the regular homework assignments
and taking the quizzes or exams.
So don't worry about it.
But the beauty is that you can take a
bit of risk on this because 
the points are extra.
Right?
They, they don't count against you if you
don't get a perfect grade, unlike the
normal points where you sort of have to
achieve a high grade to 
maintain your percentage.
And so, it's extra credit, 
and then give it a try.
So you have basically a week to 
write and then a week to grade.
And the grading is part of it. You get
points for doing the grading as well.
And so if you don't do grading, then you
don't get full points.
You can get, and so you get points for what
you write and points for what you grade.
And you have a few other people.
Now, the key difference.
This isn't a writing class, right?
We're not, I'm not your English teacher,
I'm not your composition teacher.
I'm a computer scientist.
And the people you're writing for, 
it's a peer-grading assignment.
You're not writing for me.
You're writing for them.
And so, we have a lot of various
education levels.
Not everybody is at the 
same level as whatever.
This class is supposed to be 
sort of a beginning class.
It's not supposed to be a 
super advanced class.
So we really write to that level.
We write to, you know, a 
17 or 18 year old person.
And we want to explain it.
So think of all your writing as 
explaining to somebody, to
someone sitting right next to you, 
rather than trying to impress me.
And understand that we're 
a lot of different people.
This is some data from a previous 
class that I taught.
About half of the students are 
non-English speakers.
I, I teach in English because 
it's the only language I know.
And a lot of students, it'll be 
their first online class.
And so let's just kind of understand that
we're, we're building culture here.
We're not, we're not, there's not
something for us to
fall back on. If we were doing this in a
live classroom, everyone in the 
classroom, in the freshman class, would
be somewhere between, you know, 
17 and 19 years old.
And, and, often from the 
same culture, especially
in undergraduate, and we're 
quite different than that.
We're also very diverse 
in terms of the age that we are.
This class is really aimed at the 18-24
range, kind of this age right here.
And so, if you think about it, that's a
very small fraction of the class.
The great majority of the class is older.
And often educated.
Right?
We'll see that on the next slide.
And so understand that this is how we're,
the questions are being asked.
This is the student for whom 
this class is designed.
And the other thing is, is that we 
have a lot of education in this class.
This is not this particular class, 
it's another class.
But they're, all the data is 
showing that this
is the typical makeup, although 
I want to change that.
I want to make it so that 
more of the target
audience of early college/high school 
are the ones taking this class.
But, for now, we often have the
great majority of the people 
are pretty educated.
So, oh, in this, just kind of 
three-quarters are educated.
Do not write, if you have this degree,
don't write as if you have 
a Masters degree.
You know, don't write as if 
you have, like, a JD
or a doctoral degree and show off 
how smart you are.
Be thoughtful, and use language 
that people can
understand in the class, 
for in the class.
So if you're uncomfortable writing in
English, Google Translate does a reasonable
job, but not perfect, and we'll 
talk about that in a second.
And, and please, please, please don't,
don't run something through Google
Translate and then not tell 
the graders that you did that.
So please just say, I wrote this 
in Spanish and I
translated it in English because my
English is not so good.
Because that's a signal to the 
graders to say
that they really need to ignore 
small grammar errors.
So again I'll talk about that 
in this next slide.
So here's a bit of text that I took from
a description of my Python programming
thing, Python programming class.
And, you know, what I did was I ran it
through Google Translate
a couple of times, and you see all kinds
of weird artifacts, right?
This course is specifically designed 
to be a first programming class.
This course is, is a programming course,
that's not too bad of a change.
Mastery of each of the topics in the
class, mastery of each subject 
in the classroom.
That actually might be better, 
the writing of that one 
might be better than my writing.
But then if we get down here we'll
use simple data analysis as the
programming exercises.
We will use the analysis as simple
programming exercises.
That's starting to sound not so good,
but again that's an artifact 
introduced by translation.
And this last one is terrible, right?
Process data is valuable for everyone
regardless of your career.
Look what happened.
Treat that.
Understand how to treat the data 
is valid for all regardless of race.
This is terribly written.
That's not what I wrote.
That is an effect for Google Translate.
Now when you're writing for Google
Translate, you do want to 
keep your language
less flowery in your native language,
whether it's Spanish or French or
whatever.
You want to use basic structure, 
sentence structure.
Not a lot of, you know, use active voice,
be very direct in what you say.
And give it a try to translate it back,
although what I've found is Google Translate
is surprisingly good at 
translating it back, to
one to go into Spanish and then back out.
What I tend to do is I go from English to
Spanish to French to English and then I
start seeing the artifacts.
So you might want to do that. 
You might want to take your French
to Spanish to English to French and 
then take a look at the initial
French and the changed French and see 
if you can't make it so you can
see in my situation I could see to rewrite
this sentence a little bit, right?
I, I probably wouldn't rewrite anything
else in this but I might, if I
did my English to Spanish to French to
English and I saw this, I'm like,
oops, I'm going to just 
rewrite that sentence
a little bit and run it through those
three translations again, to give you a
sense of how it's going to be seen.
Right?
So that you finally are translating 
the English back in, so.
So again, give it a try, put your name, 
I mean don't put your name, put
the fact that you translated it front
and center in the top of your document.
Plagiarism always comes up in these
classes and
in the earliest of Coursera classes, now
well over a year and a half ago,
it was fiercely discussed.
I think we're better now.
We understand that plagiarism is
potentially a cultural issue.
And different cultures think of 
plagiarism differently.
And so it's important to establish 
rules about plagiarism.
How I perceive plagiarism in this course.
Plagiarism is simply including 
material and
not acknowledging that you've 
included the material.
It's not wrong to include material 
from other sources.
It's wrong to include material from other
sources and represent it as your material.
So when you're turning in an essay, 
the words
in that essay you're representing, are,
came from you, right?
You know, if the question is, 
why is the sky blue,
and you go to, to WikiHow or
something and
you cut and paste something, 
and that's your answer, then,
and you didn't say where it 
came from, that's not good.
So it's perfectly okay to use quotes.
I mean, that's part of writing is
researching.
And if you really love how 
something was said, bring it in.
So here's kind of an example.
You know, let's say I ask you to write a
story, an essay about Vint Cerf.
And I saw this really good 
sentence in Wikipedia,
the bit in the red here in the top.
So the, so this, I saw this bit in
Wikipedia.
And I just wanted to talk about,
you know, his early career.
So, I think Vint Cerf is an important
figure in history of the Internet.
That's my statement.
Then I say in the early days Cerf was a
program manager, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And then I say he later, back to my words,
he later helped define.
Now as a teacher I see this 
really, really quickly.
Because this first part is very
conversational
this next part is very
conversational,
and this is very textbook-like.
it takes a while, but after a while, 
it's not hard
to see when the tone of a, of a 
writing changes.
And all of a sudden it gets really formal
and very fact-oriented, versus very
narrative-oriented.
When I'm writing, I tend to be 
narrative-oriented.
Tell a story.
And when Wikipedia writes, they tend to be
fact-oriented, not telling a story.
So if you intermix your writing with
Wikipedia writing, it kind of 
jumps out at people.
Now, let's say you read that 
and you can't even
think of a better way to, to, 
to phrase it.
Don't just like move the words around.
Just say, put it in as a quote.
Right?
That's what I did in the second one.
I think that Vint Cert's an important
figure in the history of the Internet.
According to Wikipedia,
and then a little, [COUGH], a little
reference mark there.
[SOUND]
And then I literally cut and paste the
exact text from Wikipedia.
Totally legitimate.
I have indicated that it is a quote.
I made it italics.
You don't have to make it italics.
And I had a little thing, and 
then I say he later helped define.
I mean, it's the same thing, but at
least I am valuing the 
Wikipedia contribution.
Now you can't take your whole article 
and say, oh, why is the sky blue.
I pasted the entire answer from
WikiHow, or whatever.
But, do you understand the point?
The point is, if they said it 
really well, include it.
Acknowledge it.
Plagiarism is not the inclusion 
of the text.
Plagiarism is the lack of the
acknowledgement of the 
inclusion of the text.
Okay.
I think I've saying, I think
I've said enough about that.
Okay.
So even though I made a big 
fuss about plagiarism,
I don't expect you to be the 
plagiarism checkers, right?
Read it.
If it feels like there's a 
sentence or two that was
plagiarized, or a paragraph, 
go ahead and stick it in Google.
Google will find in the Wikipedia page if it
just came from Wikipedia.
You know, if you think there's plagiarism,
take off points as appropriate.
You know, if you think that, you know,
you're awarding six points, and you think
that, you know, it's only worth two
because of plagiarism, then 
just make it two.
And please add comments describing
the plagiarism.
Say like, you know, I think 
your fifth sentence came
straight from Wikipedia, and so 
I've taken three points off.
Please do not, do not, do not, do not,
do not, DO NOT add comments about your
opinions about plagiarism.
Okay?
And don't say, like, do you realize
that plagiarism is the world's most
grievous crime?
Or, I, let me tell you a story 
about some one
time I caught somebody in plagiarism 
in a class that I'm teaching.
Just say, I think these two sentences came
from Wikipedia, so I'm only giving you
three points.
Stop there.
Stay with what you, is sort of 
factually about it.
Do not add your feelings about plagiarism
please, please, please, please.
It's simple enough to say I think these
sentences came from Wikipedia.
Do not talk about your views or, 
just stay away from that stuff.
So the kind of grading rubrics 
that I give you in these,
I really am measuring whether or not this
was well written for peers.
Is it interesting to read?
Does it support its arguments?
Is it on topic?
Does it include references?
Okay?
So that's what you're really doing.
So just enjoy the reading of these things.
Don't, don't go like, wow, I am a grader.
I'm an English teacher.
I don't want you to become an 
English teacher.
I want you to just become a reader.
[COUGH] Think of it as you're 
reading a blog post.
Did you enjoy the blog post?
Would you like it?
Would you recommend it to your friends?
Did the, did you enjoy the reading?
So, don't be too harsh.
Don't try to think about this 
as a writing class.
We are communicating ideas, 
and writing is one way that 
we communicate ideas.
So, in terms of grades, don't get too
worried if you get a bad score.
It is not the average 
of all the scores,
there is the, some of the high and the low
stuff gets thrown out, and the score
really comes from
the middle graders, and that's why 
we have multiple graders.
So just relax. If you get a six in your
first one, don't worry about it.
See what you can learn from it, right?
And some of the people will be wrong.
They'll just be, some people are bad
writers, and some people are
bad graders, and you will get some people
who are simply bad graders.
Relax, it's okay.
Hopefully your score won't be 
negatively affected by that.
We're not going to [SIGH]
punish bad graders.
We're not going to sort of 
swoop in and and,
and be the police on the 
grading system.
Generally it works fine with a few
anomalies.
And you just have to tolerate a, 
a few people
that kind of say things that, that they
probably shouldn't say.
So just take what is good and ignore
anything that's bad.
And I remind you that they're 
extra credit.
Right?
If you get six points, it's 
six free points.
It doesn't, it doesn't change how many
points you must earn, it
actually makes it so you can miss points,
or miss quizzes, or whatever.
And I just think part of our goal is to
learn how to do peer grading.
You know? I mean, I think part of 
our goal is to learn how to
learn together, and I think that this peer
grading is a great way of 
exchanging writing.
I mean, it's a, it's like a, writing a blog
post and then forcing five other 
people to read it.
And it, there's a lot of great stuff 
that comes from this.
So let's just learn a lot from this.
So I guess that's all I have.
And I really look forward to reading your
essays online in this class.
I have chosen essay questions 
that I am curious.
I'm curious about the answers 
that you write, so
I'll be looking at them, and 
learning from them.
Who knows?
Maybe we'll have to turn them 
into a book some day.
Cheers.
