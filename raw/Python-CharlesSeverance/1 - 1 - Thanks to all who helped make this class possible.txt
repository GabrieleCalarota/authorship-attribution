I have so many people to thank who have
helped me with
this course that it's going to take an
entire video all by itself.
The course starts with the book Python
for Informatics.
This book starts over ten years ago, when
Allen Downey wrote a book
about Java and made that an open book. And
then Jeffrey Elkner, who
is a high school teacher in Virginia, he
took that and turned it
into a Python book. And then Allen Downey
switched from teaching Java to Python.
And then he took his own book back, and
everyone kept editing this book and making
it better.
It's called Think Python.
But they published it with an open, free,
remixable license.
And so a couple years ago, I was teaching
SI 502 and needed a book.
And I thought I would write my own book,
but a
colleague of mine, Atul Prakash, said
you should look at Think Python.
So I did.
There were lots of things I liked about
the book.
It was short and to the point.
But it had a few too many computer
science things in it,
so I started rewriting the book and
changing the parts that I didn't want.
And I was able to modify that book
dramatically in about 30 days.
And by January, I was able to produce a
book in
time for my class. But the problem was I
needed physical books.
And that's where folks from the University
of Michigan Libraries came in.
Terri Geitgey runs a facility called the
Espresso Book Machine,
which is an on-demand print service, which
basically meant that I
could walk in with a print-ready PDF,
and then they
would be able to print that in
just a few hours.
And so in less than 30 days, I went from
no book to physical books.
All with a bunch, help from a bunch of
people.
In addition to the books, Open Michigan
has helped me.
Open Michigan is our group on
campus that's responsible for open
education resources.
And, working with folks like Dave
Malicke, I've been trained
to build copyright-free materials, both
the book and the slides.
Because we teachers are always dragging
stuff from Google and sticking it
in our, in our slides and and violating
copyright without even knowing it.
And so I've been trained to make slides
that I can actually release to you,
and in a way that makes it so that you can
reuse them without violating copyright.
Another thing that I need to say thanks to is
the folks that built the iBooks version of
the book.
Jason Coleman, of the University of
Michigan Library, he built that.
It took a long time. It's got awesome
videos, it's got in-book exercises,
etc. It's only for the iBook, but it's
free, and it's really quite awesome.
University of Michigan leadership around
our Coursera
effort, Martha Pollock, James Hilton,
Gautam Kaul, James Devaney,
all have given us an environment where
it's fun to explore and to
play and experiment with what it means to
work in this new environment.
Tim O'Brien, who's right behind the
camera, runs our facility here.
And it's a lot of fun to be part of this
and have all
these neat lights and cameras and stuff to
play with building materials for you.
My management at the School of
Information, Deans Tom Finholt and Beth Yakel,
were very helpful in getting this course to
come to live because there's lot
of paperwork to fill out on campus, lots
of procedures to do it,
and so having management that's very
supportive and helpful is really very
essential.
And my fellow faculty members, like Atul
Prakash, who
helped me get started on the Think Python
book.
And Tanya Rosenblat and Paul Resnik both
have used early versions of my software
and sort
of tolerated as I got my software working,
the software that we're now using in the
course.
And Michael Hess is one of our technical
support people.
As well as a fellow faculty member here at
the School of Information.
And he has given me access to a very
large server that helps in making sure
that I can
use the technical resources that I need at
no charge,
so that we don't have to charge for the
course.
The Skulpt software is an essential part
of this class.
It's also a part of the Rice class as well.
It is what allows you to write Python and
run it in the browser.
It itself is an amazing piece of
technology.
And the leader for that is a fellow named
Brad Miller, from Luther College, who also
teaches Python there.
And literally without Brad, I don't think
there would
be any way for me to have built this
course.
I need to thank everybody from Coursera
who's helped me and mentored
me and helped me understand what it means
to teach at scale.
Daphne and Andrew have been very
supportive.
I completely agree with all of the things
that we want to do
in terms of getting this teaching as
widely distributed as we possibly can.
Pang Wei, early on, was one of the good
mentors that really helped me
understand that teaching at scale is not
the same as teaching in the classroom.
How assessment needs to be different, how
interaction needs to be different.
Kate McShane Urban is our current, she's
like our, she
watches over everything that goes on
and makes sure that everything works.
I've made a number of really nice friends
on the technical
team who have helped me build the learning
tools interoperability
that lets me plug things like maps and
autograders and just plug stuff in.
Brandon Saeta and Nick Dellamaggiore are
two of
the folks that have really helped make all
that work.
They're also responsible for many of the
integration strategies around Coursera.
And so that's really cool.
Another group that I need to thank comes
from IEEE Computer Magazine.
I'm an author, column author for IEEE
Computer Magazine, and
I write this monthly column
called Computing Conversations.
And it's part of what funds me to travel
around and
make these videos that I share with you in
the class.
The chief editor, Ron Vetter;
Jennifer Stout who's a, does
most of the editing of the columns, and
Kerry Clark Walsh.
What's cool about IEEE Computer is these
are
copyrighted materials, but they have given
me permission
to share them with you at no charge
because they just want you to have this
information.
I also need to thank Sue, Mazen, and Mauro,
my Community Teaching Assistants.
They have been with me since I
started Internet History, Technology, and
Security and
for Programming for Everybody, they have been
very deeply involved in the
behind-the-scenes preparation.
And so months before the class started,
they were looking over my materials.
And even though the materials have, always
have room
for improvement, the fact that they're as
good as they
are when we, when we release them is is due
in a large part to the Community Teaching
Assistants' help.
I also need to thank all the students
in my classes who have, who've dealt with
draft versions of books and half-finished
software, like SI 182,
SI 502, SI 301, SI 364, and SI 664.
In many ways, they were the guinea pigs
for the student experience.
But, really, the most important folks to
thank are you, the Coursera students.
I just went through 10 or 15 people's
names, and they helped me.
They helped produce what you're
experiencing.
I don't think they help me just because
they like me.
They help me because it's kind of the
nature of what we do.
We are at an institution that values
teaching.
And when someone like me comes to a fellow
person at the
University of Michigan and says, I need help
to make my teaching better,
people help. And frankly, we've been doing this
for quite some time and what's really neat now,
is  we're doing it
for a much larger group of people. And so it's
really you, the Coursera students, that
makes all this effort worthwhile.
So, in closing, I just want to thank you,
and I'll see you in class.
