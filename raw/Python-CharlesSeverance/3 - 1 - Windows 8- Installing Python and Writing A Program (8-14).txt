Hello.
Welcome to my video on how to run
Python on Windows.
I'm Charles Severance
and this is my book, Python for
Informatics.
And I have a bunch of free courses.
The book is free.
And so I, I hope you enjoy 
learning how to program.
So the first thing we're going to do is
download some software.
You need a programmer editor, and so
Notepad Plus Plus is a good one.
It has syntax highlighting and other things,
and it doesn't mess up your files.
It understands that you just want
a plain text file.
So I'm going to download 
and install this.
You want to be an administrator
when you're doing this in your
Windows box. It might,
I'm an administrator on my
particular Windows box.
Going to run it.
And you might get prompted for a password
here, but, I am just going
to say yes because I am the administrator,
and I'll run through the installation
process here.
So that's all done.
I'm not going to bother running it right
now, so there we go.
So I've done Notepad, the next thing
I want to do is I want to download Python.
It's here on the Python download
page. For my class I use Python 2.7.
You could use Python 3, they're slightly
different languages,
I think it's fine to learn both languages,
although we're really at
the point where increasingly people are
starting to use Python 3,
but there's so many things that 
are there for Python 2.
So, the question often asked is like,
which one of these two?
Do I go the X86 or the non?
It's pretty safe to do this one, but
so, if I go Start, and then I type PC info,
this will tell me something about this PC.
Different versions of Windows have this in
different places, but basically I get to
the point where it says I have a system
type 64-bit operating system.
So I can get a 64-bit download, which is
nice to do. So I will go back to Control Panel.

And I'm going to download my Windows
64-bit installer.
And I'm going to run it.
And again, I'm going to need to
be an administrator.
I'm going to install it for all users.
I'm going to leave it in the directory
that it wants to put it on my local drive.
Python27.
You can put it elsewhere, but then you're
going to have to remember it.
Please don't put spaces in the path,
no matter what you do.
And again, I'm the superuser,
so I'm going to say Yes.
So, we're all done.
Okay, so now I'm going to minimize
my web browser.
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to run Notepad.
And of course you can have shortcuts,
but I'm going to use the Start button.
I'm going to hit Start and I'm
going to type, in my keyboard, notepad,
n-o-t-e-p-a-d.
And up comes Notepad Plus, and 
I will take that.
So here we have Notepad Plus.
And I'm going to write a simple
Python program.
p-r-i-n-t Hello world
Okay?
And I'm going to file, I'm going
to save this.
So I'm going to say File > Save As.
And I'm going to put this on my desktop.
I might, I could make a folder.
Sure, let's make a folder.
[SOUND]
I'll call this learn, because I'm Python
learning.
So I'm going up a folder. You'll notice
the folder showed up as soon as I made it.
Now I'm going to make this file, I'm
going to call it first prog p-y.
Now you'll notice it did syntax coloring
as soon as it
realizes that this is a .py file.
It knows the Python language and so it's
giving me some help.
And if I go into learn, I will see that
there is indeed, sitting in this folder, a
file called firstprog.py.
Unfortunately, Windows hides the .py but
shows us this little python icon.
You can run it by clicking on this but
this is not my preferred way
of running it.
Okay?
So I'm just going to hide, minimize that
and I'm going to say Start, and then
I'm going to type c-m-d.
This is the Command Prompt.
Sometime you'll do Start > Run > cmd on really
old versions of Windows, or just Start > cmd.
And then run Command Prompt.
And, you know, this, this will initially
seem, you know,
like, why am I using this old-school
command prompt?
But after a while, part of the goal
is to really get
to be good at your computer and knowing
how the computer works.
So this is the Command Prompt
and you type commands.
So one of the commands you can type is dir.
You're in your home directory, that's what
Users\csev means.
And I'm going to go into my desktop
with a cd, which stands for change
directory, D-e-s-k-t-o-p.
Now I'm my desktop, move my little
cursor there.
And I do a dir and you'll see a whole
series of things there.
And then you'll see this learn folder,
l-e-a-r-n.
So I'm going to change into that
directory, cd learn, and do a dir there.
And lo and behold, I see exactly what I
was seeing in here.
So this is really just a graphical image
of what's in that folder.
I mean, you can even sort of,
see the path
if you look here, that it's in my
C:\Users\csev\Desktop\learn, which
exactly is where I'm at.
C:\Users\csev\Desktop\learn.
This may seem, and when we, when we start
reading and writing files, it's important
that you put your files in the same folder
here as first, as the programs.
So to run the Python program
you simply type firstprog.py.
It's as, it's as if
Whoops.   
f-i-r-s-t-p-r-o-g dot p-y.
It's as if you built an extension
of the system. The little
program you wrote in Python
is sitting there for you to run.
And I can make a change, like
something else, and save that file.
And then I can run it again.
Now, here's a trick.
I can hit the up arrow and just run the
same program again.
Syntax error, p-r, oh, I put an m in.
[NOISE] print, Save.
Now I just come back here.
I hit up arrow.
And run it again.
So now I have my little two-line program,
and away it goes.
So the only other thing to know
is to how
to start Python for the Command, so you
can do interactive playing with Python.
And this way you can type Python
commands.
And you can add it to your path
and go look
on Google as to how to add something to
your path.
because, it's in, it's in, but 
it's easier just to say c:\python27,
cuz that's where we, oops, python27\python.
I cannot type.
[SOUND]
And so this is the chevron prompt.
Right there's the chevron prompt.
So I can type a print "yo", or I can type,
take me to your python leader.
Syntax error.
Yeah, we've been through this before.
I HATE COMPUTERS.
Okay.
So to get out, but here you gotta be
careful because you can't run
programs, and so you
can type quit to get out and now you're
back at the Command Prompt, and
you can type dir.
So you can learn the commands here. All
we really know is we know dir, cd, and
when in doubt, just close this window,
if you get lost in the wrong folder or
something.
So that's pretty much all I wanted to do.
Please don't make directory names or
folder names with spaces in.
It just makes life confusing, so stick
with simple names.
Don't put long spaces in either folder
names or file names
because then it's harder to
do this stuff, okay?
Thanks.
