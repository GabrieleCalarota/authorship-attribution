Hello, and welcome to Week 2.
I'm going to walk you through
Assignment 2.2.
Spoiler alert: the best thing to do is to
do these before you watch this, right?
So just click over there, and go
ahead and do it.
If you're doing it on your desktop or
laptop that's great, then cut and paste.
So, a spoiler alert.
But I'm going to show you how to do it
because some of you in
the forums have talked about how you're
still a little lost, and that's okay.
You're going to be lost.
It just, that's why I give you these so
that you don't get too stuck.
Because with repetition, this all becomes
second nature.
And give yourself a couple of more weeks
[NOISE] You'll, you'll know everything.
So, so, so this is my last weather alert,
so let's go take a look at Assignment 2.2.
So here I am, Assignment 2.2, I'm going to
go click in to the Autograder and write
a program that uses raw input to prompt a
user for their name and welcomes them.
And you're going to do this, so I'm going
to first do this not in the Autograder.
I'm going to do it on my desktop, and
later I'll do it in the Autograder.
So by now I hope you know if you're
working on your desktop.
For those of you who aren't using desktop,
you can just watch this.
So I've got to write a program that uses
raw input.
And so raw input is a function.
I need a variable, name equals raw_input.
If you've watched the lectures
What is your name.
So basically, raw input pauses a program,
prompts with the what is your
name prompt, and then whatever you type is
moved into the variable name.
Okay?
And then I will say, print Hello, comma, name.
And that says print the string hello, then
afterwards fill in that variable name.
So this is the first line and then the
second line.
Okay? And so that's Hello name.
And so that's our little program.
And I'm going to save this file,
File > SaveAs. I'm going to
put it on my desktop and make a
new folder called
pr4e and go into that folder, and I'm
going to save my file as
assignment 22.py.
It's best to not use spaces in your
assignment
names, just use like dashes, and don't get
too tricky.
I mean, your operating system often
can't handle this.
So I've got this, it's in my
home directory, that's what that little
tilde means.
desktop pr4e assignment 22.py. And I go to
Terminal program,
or command line if you're running
on Windows.
And then I'm going to go into my desktop
because
I'm in my home directory already,
with cd desktop.
Then I'm going to go into pr4e and then
I'm going to type the command ls.
Now if you're on Windows you type dir.
And now I see that I've got this file,
it's the file that I just saved up there.
And in Windows, you would actually type,
assn-2-2.py, you don't need to type
python.
But in the Mac, you type python and then
the following, a-s-s-n-2.
So you'll notice that I said a-s-s and I
do this so fast.
a-s-s-n-2 and I hit the tab key and it
completes for me automatically.
And that says load up Python and then
read the program instructions in that
file, Python a-s-s-n-2.py.
What's your name.
Sarah.
Hello Sarah, okay?
So then we ran it.
Now, let's go back to the Autograder.
Now, if you are just using the Autograder
to do your development, you'd type in this
program.
But if you're using your desktop, the
clever thing to do
is just copy, copy and then come over
here and then paste.
Paste in the working code.
Okay?
And then I'll type Check Code, and this is
going to, the
raw input here is going to prompt up, pop
up a dialog box.
And the prompt is what is your name,
and it tells you you're supposed to
type Sarah.
Well, then you make a mistake,
Alright, Sahar.
I can't type Sarah because I type too
fast.
So it's going to run, the program's
going to
run and now it's going to say, mismatch,
and say, please correct your code and
re-run because I didn't match the
desired output.
I don't have to change my program, I just
have to type the right thing.
So this time when it asks me, I'll type
Sarah.
And now, Hello Sarah.
And my.
I get a match.
And it upgrade, it does the grade updating
on the server.
Okay?
So that's, that's pretty much it.
I mean if you really wanted to, you would,
you know, type name equals.
You can just do all your coding right
here.
[SOUND] What, what, I type so terribly.
What is your name?
And again, I could run this.
Oh wait.
Raw input is not defined on line 1.
Well, I missed a w, I missed a w.
So I can edit it here.
And then I can say run it.
[SOUND] But then there's no output because
they don't have a print statement here.
And I got a little coaching here.
It says you must use the print statement.
So even, even if your output looks
perfect, it
sometimes wants to coach you on
what you did.
It says, hey, you must use the print
statement to print the line of output.
Thank you, virtual coach in the
Autograder.
And so, you don't want to do that.
Okay.
So then I'll put a print.
Print name.
And I'll check that.
And Sarah.
And it says Sarah.
Now it looks likes good, but it's
like it wants
Hello SaraH, so now we We gotta go,
hello Sarah.
Now the space gets added just by that.
The comma actually adds a space.
I keep draggin' these things on my screen.
Hello Sarah.
Now the output matches, it looks happy.
And my grade's updated on the server.
So there you go.
Kind of using both the terminal and a
command line to do program 2.2,
and then pasting it in the Autograder or
just writing it in the Autograder.
I hope this has helped you and I'll see
you in the forums
