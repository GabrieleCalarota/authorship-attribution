Hello, and welcome to a worked
exercise for Python for Informatics:
Exploring information.
I am your host, Charles Severance, and
this material is copyright Creative
Commons Attribution.
So again, you're supposed to try to
work these exercises yourself before 
you attempt them.
Just, these are good crutches to 
make sure that you
understand, but make sure you 
give it a try yourself.
And if you don't understand 
how to basically
create and edit programs, you 
should go back
to www.pythonlearn.com, and 
work through some of the
installation instructions for 
Python and your text editor.
So here's our exercise, we're going to do
the classic rate times pay with overtime.
And so the idea is that, oops, you have,
pay times rate and for 40 hours you
get the basic rate and if you work above
it, you get one and a half times that.
So if it's $10 an hour, you get $15 an
hour for the hours above 40.
So let's go ahead and start 
TextWrangler, and start
a command line. I'm going to close that,
close our drawer, make it smaller.
And I'm going to, I'm going to pull my,
go into the
Desktop, go to py4inf, see I've got a few
files here.
And in this case, I am going 
to open hours1.py.
And I'm going to immediately 
save it as hours2.py.
I mean, why rewrite all that 
stuff we did before?
So this I guess I can get rid 
of this one now.
So it's hours2.py.
And so now we have, the, 
I'll keep that in.
We have the rate and the hours.
I'll put that print statement back in.
And the problem is I can't
I can't just do pay equals rate times
hours, so I need an if-then-else.
So let's do an if.
If the hours is less than 40.
And we can say, pay equals rate times
hours, that's fine.
So now let's come up.
I'll make that four spaces.
There we go.
I could write another statement
that says like this.
If, actually it should be less than or 
equal to 40.
If pay is greater than 40, we need
a different calculation.
And, and that one is pay,
is, there's a couple of ways to do this,
but I'm going to do it this way.
Rate times 40, which means those are the,
those are the hours.
That's your basic rate.
Then I'm going to add rate times 1.5,
that's one and a half times
the rate, times, and then the hours above
40, which is hours minus 40.
So this bit here is the 
hours above 40.
Now operator precedence would say that
these multiplications are done before this
subtraction.
And that might not work so well, so let's
go ahead and run this and see what
happens, okay?
So we got pay is rate times hours, and pay
is equal to rate times 1.5 times hours
minus 40.
Let's go ahead and run this.
I got python, hours.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Let's do 30 hours and $10, that's 
looking good.
So, that is, we have, you know, and
that's running through this bit of code
right here.
And let's do exactly 40 hours, and that's
looking good.
So let's do 50 hours because we can
calculate that in our head, that's 10
hours extra.
And then a rate of $10 should be 500.
That doesn't seem right, so 50 times 10,
what's wrong here?
50 times 10?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Hours is less than 40.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Now I'm confused.
Let's run this, well, oops.
What did I do here?
Pay is greater than 40, that does 
not seem right.
Did I save this file?
I'm crazy.
50 hours, $10 an hour, oh, okay, I must
not have saved the file, okay.
So, [LAUGH].
Pay is not defined on line eight.
Oops, I was typing too fast.
That needs to be hours 
greater than 40.
Okay.
So that's better, so now we have hours
less than 40 and hours greater than 40.
So let's run that one again.
50 hours at $10 an hour.
50 hours at $10 an hour.
That'd be like 600 something, this does
not look like the right number.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
We, and so we got I will, I will just take
this print back out, print of rate and
hour, save that.
Let's run it again.
50 hours, $10 per hour, $1100.
That does not look right.
Let's take a look at this.
Rate times 40, that's pretty obvious, 
it'd be $400.
Rate times one and a half, that'd be $15,
times number of hours minus 40.
Oh, so this is an operator precedence
problem.
So, if you recall, multiplication happens
before addition, and so Python is going to
do this calculation first.
This is the actual calculation, it's
multiplying the rate times one and
a half, times the number of hours, and
then it's subtracting 40.
This ends up being a rather large number,
and that's how our calculation is wrong.
That is not how we meant to do this.
Oops, so let's put parentheses in, because
we want to subtract 40 from
the hours before we do the multiplication.
We want this to happen first.
We want the hours to subtract 
the 40 so we'll end up
with 10 hours and then multiply that
by the rate.
So let me save that.
And run it. 50 hours, $10 an hour.
550.
Much better, much better.
[WHISTLE] That looks pretty much better.
Okay, so that's, so we're kind of done
with that.
We had that little mistake there, of the
parentheses not working.
And the other thing is, is that the much
better
way to write this is just putting 
an else here.
Alright?
So we just say else.
And so now, we have an if-then-else.
If it's less than 40, less than or equal
to 40, we do this.
If it's greater than 40, we do that.
And then we do print pay.
So let's save that one.
So 50 hours, $10 an hour, 550.
So this if-then-else formulation is a
much better way to do this 
particular problem.
