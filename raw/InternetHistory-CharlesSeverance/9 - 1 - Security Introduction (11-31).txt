Hello and welcome to our security 
lecture. 
I'm Charles Severance and I encourage you 
to grab the power points and remix them 
and use them in your own courses. 
Use the videos, use everything in your 
own courses. 
you don't have to teach this whole course 
it's quite a bit. 
So so let's start out by meeting some 
nice people. 
These people are Alice and Bob and they 
simply want to communicate some 
information you know, left to their own 
devices. 
And they don't want the rest of the world 
to know about what they're communicating 
and so they want to encrypt it in some 
way. 
Now, in the cryptograph, cryptography 
world, they all I'll call these two 
people the good people Alice and Bob. 
And they simply are A and B, kind of, 
very computerask variable names, A and B, 
Alice and Bob. 
And then there are some bad guys. 
Right, there's the bad guys and, and 
often they are called C, like, Carol or 
Carlos or Charlie, or, or something like 
that. 
And they're even Chuck. 
Even Chuck is a bad guy. 
Or they are Eve, Eve for the 
eavesdropper. 
And the idea is somewhere in the middle 
here. 
Somewhere in the middle, you have some 
person with bad intent. 
Here we have Trinity from The Matrix, and 
she looks as, she looks as bad as you can 
look. 
Right? 
so Alice and Bob seem to be real happy 
people. 
They're just trying to get you know, get 
things done and send some information 
without being bothered. 
And then, and then Trinity's there 
eavesdropping. 
And, but there's other things. 
You can eavesdrop, you can sort of 
redirect the message and change it. 
There's all kinds of things that the bad 
guy in the middle is going to do. 
And so Alice and Bob are far away from 
each other and they have to communicate 
securely. 
And they, it's a, it's a, it's literal 
gantlet of problems that they have to 
face. 
And various people with bad intent, with 
bad purposes, sometimes just wanting to 
see what's going on versus wanting to 
change what's going on. 
Versus completely redirect communication. 
So Alice, Bob and then a whole series of 
bad guys with various bad guys and girls 
with various evil intent. 
So it's always fun to talk about security 
because the question is, you, and what 
does security mean to you and what does 
it mean to me. 
And whenever you're thinking about 
security, you gotta figure out sort of, 
who is out to get you and why are they 
out to get you. 
And for us average people, we are so 
boring that literally pretty much the 
only thing the world wants from us. 
Is they want to steal our, you know, they 
want to steal our credit card numbers. 
And and then buy stuff with them for just 
a couple of days before the credit card 
company shuts them down. 
Now, if you're running for public office 
there's a whole bunch of your opponents 
that are going to want to break into your 
email. 
And and, and that happens right. 
Those kinds of shenanigans happen. 
So, if you're interesting, or 
influential, or running for public 
office, you have a different problem than 
if you're just kind of a mere civilian 
like us. 
And so, at the end of the day, you can 
worry about security, and you can kind of 
wear tinfoil clothing or something. 
But at the end of the day, you and I are 
so boring that nobody really cares. 
But it's good to assume that they're out 
to get you, right. 
That, that, you try to be as secure as 
you can, and be aware of your environment 
and be as secure as you possibly can with 
your information. 
And, with your communications. 
So who is out to get us? 
Well, the government. 
So now we're going to actually turn the 
tables, right? 
In the very first lecture, we were the 
good guys. 
The good guys were the ones that were 
trying to break the cryptography. 
And the bad guys were the ones that were 
trying to hide their, their, their bad 
messages. 
And the government were the good guy. 
And Bletchley Park. 
And they, they broke the codes, and they, 
they saved Western civilization. 
Yay, good guys! 
Well, now, we're the Germans. 
We're the Japanese. 
We're tryin' to communicate. 
People're watchin'. 
And guess what? 
It's the same people. 
The government, the government's most 
likely interested in what you're doing. 
again most of us are so boring the 
government really doesn't care at all. 
But the government probably has the best 
security breaking equipment on the planet 
right now, better than the criminals. 
And so, it's, it's just an interesting 
flip of the model, right? 
Where now, we are trying to communicate, 
and the government with all of their 
bombas and little rotating devices. 
Sitting in some warehouse somewhere that 
we don't know is taking our private 
communications and they're trying to 
break them. 
And we're in a war trying to make our 
communications more and more secure while 
the government says woah, we have to 
invent, like, electronic computers. 
Because we have to have bigger computers, 
because the people at, us good guys who 
are doing the encrypting. 
We're trying to come up with more and 
more clever ways to encrypt, and the 
government has to keep coming up with 
ways to decrypt. 
And you could cast this as criminals 
versus good folks. 
You could cast it as governments versus 
governments. 
At the end of the day, it's an arms race, 
and it's, it's rather symmetric as to 
which side you're on, right? 
I mean, we started out with the people 
trying to hide the information were the 
bad guys, and now we're the good guys. 
Why are we the good guys? 
because it's us. 
As soon as we decide it's us, we're the 
good guys. 
Here's a little, here's a little picture 
I took a couple of years ago when I 
visited Bletchley park this actually lead 
to the video a year and a half later. 
and in this my friend who works at the 
open university, who also does massively 
open online courses that's Joel he's now 
retired. 
He's the tour guide there and, and a dear 
and personal friend. 
And and another of my dear and personal 
friends whose face you can't see is right 
here. 
His name is Chuck. 
He currently works at Shazam in London. 
And, and he and I just got away for the 
weekend and went up to Bletchley Park and 
took a tour. 
Now, just, just a little interesting 
connection: I sort of mentioned in a 
previous lecture about the Matrix. 
So you notice that Chuck here is wearing 
a jacket from the movie Matrix. 
I mentioned he was the one that wrote the 
hacking scene with Trinity. 
So here we all are together. 
We're at Bletchley Park. 
Alan Turing had an office in this, this 
is one of Alan Turing's offices at 
Bletchley Park. 
Here's Joel, open, open teaching and 
learning. 
Here is Chuck worked on the Matrix. 
And here's Trinity, right? 
Except that now Trinity's our enemy 
instead of our friend, although in the 
movie, we were rooting for Trinity. 
But, we're the one's trying to protect 
what we're doing from the Trinity's of 
the world. 
We're the good guys now, and Trinity is 
the bad girl. 
Okay she's the bad lady trying to break 
into our stuff and we're protecting 
ourselves against Trinity. 
So tables have completely turned okay. 
So before we go too far you know you'll 
run into your organizations with lots of 
people who are like security experts. 
And I find security experts generally 
very annoying. 
because they, like, think they're smarter 
than they are. 
Security experts have this theory that 
more security is better. 
And the reality is, is that perfect serv, 
security is unachievable. 
If you want perfect security, like, lock 
yourself in a room and whisper to 
somebody. 
Oh wait a sec. 
And then the guard will come in and hear 
you, or whatever. 
There'll be a microphone. 
So the notion that perfect security and 
that you, your company can spend more and 
more and more money of its budget on 
security. 
just because the security expert thinks 
that you should Is really kind of a 
fallacy. 
Security is a cost benefit analysis, and 
so, if you think of credit card 
companies, you know, what's the security 
of this number. 
I won't show you the number. 
But, what if I lose this number? 
What's the consequences? 
I've had many credit cards that got 
compromised. 
I don't exactly know how. 
They've got software inside of the 
computer companies that captures. 
Like when all of a sudden I live in 
Michigan and a bunch of charges at the 
New Jersey Walmart are showing up and I 
never got on a plane. 
I'm amazed at how rare it is that your 
identity actually gets lost permanently. 
So I'm really impressed with how the 
banks are capable. 
And so they have this number that makes 
it real convenient for us to buy. 
We can type it into a web form, we can do 
all these things, and one in zillion 
times it gets compromised. 
And, so, they lose 50 bucks. 
But billions of dollars of commerce 
happens. 
So, there is always a security versus 
cost. 
If basically for me to use this credit 
card, I'd had to have sort of a, a 
personal guard from the, the company with 
me all the time. 
It'd be very expensive for me to buy 
stuff on Amazon and have it shipped to my 
house. 
And so, understand that when you start 
getting into conversations with security, 
you, professionals. 
Sometimes they're the kind that 
understand that security is naturally 
imperfect. 
And everything is a cost benefit 
analysis, rather than more security is 
always better. 
So more is not always better. 
That's just my little speech about 
security in case you get stuck in a 
conversation with some pompous security 
expert. 
They're mostly pompous. 
So database administrators are pompous 
too. 
But I hop you're not, not, you're not a 
database administrator security expert. 
But um, [COUGH] the best security experts 
that I've ever met are the ones that 
understand this. 
And they can, they can, they can 
characterize every issue in terms of a 
cost benefit analysis. 
And then you'd know, you'd know, you'd 
know, know that you've one into one that 
is really smart and bright. 
So, the terminology that we're going to 
use for the rest of the segments of this 
lecture, we're going to be solving two 
basic problems. 
One is confidenti, confidentiality. 
And confidentiality is the, the, the 
leakage of information. 
So, if I was to want to send this credit 
card number to one of you watching right 
now without the rest of you seeing my 
credit card number. 
The, the mere revealing of that 
information is the problem. 
So I want to come up with a way to send 
it to you. 
So that no one except the one person that 
I want to see it gets it. 
That's confidentiality. 
The other problem is one of integrity. 
And that is, in a sense, knowing that A, 
that the information that you got comes 
from who you thought it came from. 
And B that it wasn't modified on the way. 
So there are things like digital 
signatures that sort of fall into this 
category and other mechanisms that we'll 
talk about. 
So these, these two things of 
confidentiality and integrity, will run 
through the rest of the lectures that we 
have on security. 
Okay. 
So, coming up next, we're just, we're 
going to start diving right in.
