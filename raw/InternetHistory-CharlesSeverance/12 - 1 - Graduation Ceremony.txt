[MUSIC]. 
Hello, and welcome to the graduation 
ceremony for my MOOC. 
I'm of course Dr Charles Severance, and 
I'm your instructor. 
And I'll be awarding you your 
certificate, when the time comes. 
I really appreciate the fact that you've 
stuck with the class long enough to get 
a, to get a certificate. 
but as is traditional with graduations, 
we have a graduation speaker. 
And he's my good friend and colleague 
Curt Bonk, from, Indiana University. 
And, so, before we do the, graduation 
ceremony, I would like to have our 
graduation speaker talk briefly. 
Kurt. 
 >> This is going to be a PC talk. 
 >> There you go. 
What does that mean? 
 >> Well, politically correct. 
 >> Okay. 
 >> At least for one thing. 
I got my red Indiana glasses, and my, 
blue. 
 >> Go Blue. 
 >> Michigan, blue shirt on. 
It's partly about what I'll call not 
personal computers, another PC word, but 
Possible Courses, meaning possible paths. 
Not next courses you're going to take 
with Doctor Chuck, necessarily. 
But what I want to walk you through is 
four P words, four C words for your 
possible courses in life. 
This, course, this MOOC, was about, your 
passion, your interest, what you decided 
to do. 
You moved into an area, maybe a new area, 
that's within your, comfort zone, or 
maybe a bit beyond it. 
But you're trying to find, your element 
in life, as Sir Ken Robinson says. 
We're all looking for our personal 
element, right? 
So, at number one, passion. 
You have to be passionate about your 
course interests in what you explore. 
As part of passion, you can't just be 
passionate and expect to succeed in life. 
You need a purpose, you need a goal. 
You need to be moving toward something. 
As this Professor at Stanford talks 
about, The Highest Goal. 
Maybe this course you took wasn't your 
highest goal. 
But it was a goal, nonetheless. 
And we're all moving towards that. 
So we want to have purpose. 
We want to have passion. 
But the only way you're going to get 
through a MOOC, is to have persistence, 
or grit. 
You push your way through it. 
Persevere in that class. 
Find that extra energy inside. 
And I want to congratulate all of you for 
finding that. 
You've got your passion, right? 
You found your purpose, hopefully even 
just a course related purpose. 
And per, persistence, perseverance, grit. 
That's the number one word today in 
psychology. 
Number four, of course you're in this 
class, so you have to have a little bit 
of playfulness along the way. 
You know I got into MOOCing stance when I 
did my MOOC for a week. 
You can take a look at it online, but I 
have a little playfulness in my MOOC. 
Four P words, keep those in mind as you 
perceive, another P word, into life and 
your possible courses in your life. 
C words, of course you chose, to get 
involved, choice to C word you've had 
autonomy. 
It's your personal decision to get into 
this class and complete that class to 
know the C word. 
But commitment, the second C word I want 
to focus on, you not always just decided 
or chose, you committed to it to 
completing this course. 
And that, when you come, when you did 
that, all your peers were watching you, 
and talking to you, and sharing with you, 
and, next word, connections. 
A CMOOC, a connectivist MOOC and, any 
class online, is about about connections 
and relationships. 
Hopefully, you didn't just finish this 
class, you formed new bridges, new 
relationships, new possible pathways, 
possible courses in your life. 
And so those connections you have might 
help you down the road anywhere. 
Not just for the content here, but maybe 
they'll help you get an new job 
somewhere, or find out about a new 
interest, right? 
And then, what is this about? 
Some of you will want the certificate, 
you're going to want this. 
Some of you want your million dollars. 
Well, maybe you won't make a million from 
taking this class or all your classes, 
but what you will do is maybe like Steve 
Jobs is become innovative. 
The book I'm listening to now in my car 
and I just finished Defining Your 
Element. 
You have completed a course, you might 
get a certificate, another C word. 
So those are the four P words, passion, 
persistence, purpose, and playfulness. 
And the four C words we moved through, 
choice, right? 
You want to have some choice in your 
life. 
Commitment to things that you do choose 
to, to pursue, and relationships or 
connections, and finally, completion. 
A course, a certificate, and you move on 
in life. 
If you can keep those eight principles in 
mind as you proceed into other courses. 
I think maybe you'll find some future 
successes. 
I hope you do, I hope you follow your 
heart into additional courses with Dr 
Chuck or with other people. 
So I congratulate all of you on not only 
signing up. 
While I'm completing as many of the 
modules, and maybe all of them, so you 
can get your certificate, not just here. 
But your life certificate as a open 
learner in an informal, now formal 
learning. 
Thank you very much. 
[SOUND] 
 >> Outstanding, outstanding. 
so I really want to thank Curt for 
coming, here in Ann Arbor. 
he came all the way up from Bloomington. 
and so Curt and I have done a number of 
things together. 
 >> Just to be here with Chuck, you 
know. 
[LAUGH]. 
 >> No, no that wasn't it. 
He might be have another reason to be 
here, so we figured we would tape this. 
So it is now time for you to sort of walk 
in front of your computer and receive 
your fake graduation certificate. 
I mean, there's a, it's a little known 
fact that when you actually graduate from 
college they don't actually give you the 
real certificate. 
They give you a carfeully rolled up piece 
of paper with a little bow on it. 
And then you get to your seat and you 
open it up and it's blank. 
[MUSIC]. 
But that's what we're going to do again 
and you, you can print your own 
certificate or badge depending on the 
course that you've taken. 
And so it is time for you to get up and 
sort of walk in front of your television 
or your laptop and I will hand you your 
certificate. 
I have my Harry Potter Slytherin Severus 
Snape wand, to poof, you know, make you 
educated. 
And so here you go. 
I congratulate you and you can reach up 
and grab your certificate, and there you 
go. 
 >> Shake your hand. 
 >> Shake your hand. 
We'll shake your hand. 
We'll both shake your hand and and as 
Curt said this is hopefully just the 
beginning of a number of wonderful 
courses. 
[MUSIC]. 
 >> And so again, thank you for your 
time. 
Thank you for your persistence. 
Thank you for your commitment, and 
hopefully you'll see both of us on the 
net and on the web teaching the internet 
classes. 
So thank you very much. 
 >> Door is open.
