So, as you can see, none of this is easy.
It wasn't easy for Larry Smarr and now
we basically have the 
lobbyists once again.
The lobbyists are deciding that there's 
only going to be 15 million dollars.
Because if it's 15 million dollars, they
can only build a 56-kilobit line.
But Michigan thought outside the box, some
people might say we cheated.
Other universities who wanted to get the
grant kind of thought we did cheat.
We didn't play by the rules, like in Star
Trek, we rewrote the rules.
So, we got it.
And we slid underneath the nose of AT&T
a one-and-a-half- megabit network that
started, started large and it started fast
and got faster.
And, as Doug talked, it was a very, very,
very successful network and it, it, it
didn't, it had follow-on effects
just like Larry talked about.
It had these follow-on effects of causing
campuses to build networking because in
would come this really fast national
network, so you'd better fix the 
on-campus networking.
So it was really quite wonderful.
And the partners, IBM and MCI.
The other thing is, AT&T was being beat up
by MCI at the time, and maybe they weren't
noticing.
So we might have been lucky.
It could easily have been two years
earlier, or two years later it might not
have worked.
So, whatever.
It did work.
And, and we can be very grateful.
So the University of Michigan
was sort of the center of, they were in
the network operations center and
did the network design, worked on the
software with IBM, and built the network.
And, it had a very exponential growth as
it went forward.
This building right here is on our north
campus, and it was for me personally the
very first place that I typed the
first characters that went across the
Internet. I walked in this door to, I
wasn't at the university at that time, but
I had friends here and so I came in and I
was typing you know, hello, 
on the Internet.
And so, this building was where the
network operations center was and where I,
I touched the Internet for the, 
the NSF Net for the first time.
So it started out real simple.
But its goal, its goal was to enable
connections to other networks.
The regional networks got formed,
Larry Smarr mentioned that.
And so then the backbone became
sort of a forcing function.
Get more campuses on and more and more
states, et cetera, et cetera.
Now, one of the things that was quite
interesting is we in the academic field
had the right to use this network.
But when it first started out, it was
supposed to be academics only.
And then once it was established in the
late 80s and early 90s, there were some
people that started sort of like, bending
those rules or bypassing those rules or
ignoring those rules, and it wasn't really
clear who was supposed to police those
rules. And the people like at 
the University of Michigan, 
they, their heart wasn't in
reducing who would use the Internet.
They wanted to expand it, right?
And so there were places, often bulletin
board systems would somehow get a
connection to the Internet and then they would
give Internet access to a 
bunch of nonacademics.
And so it became Increasingly in the late
80s understood by everyone around the
world. But this is pretty much 
nerds, right, that can
sit with a screen with a command-line
interface with a text-based screen, and
they can get excited about that.
I'm, I'm like that, I can get excited
about things that are non-graphical
because I just make it up in my head.
But we needed something to pop this into
the collective consciousness of all
humanity, rather than just academics
first, and then nerds second.
But, that was about to change.
