So I just wanted to give you a sense of
the what the end user's experience of
using computation and communication in the
60s and the early 70s was.
Like I said, this was a fun time.
If you can't communicate to people
thousands of miles away and all of a
sudden this gadget on your desk allows
you to do it, even if it's gigantic and
even if it makes a lot of noise it's still
impressive and it still changes how you
view the
universe, right?
The fact that your colleagues can be taken
through this keyboard.
And your colleagues are on the other side
of this keyboard.
That is a transformative notion even if
the technology these days seems very
crude.
And we went through a lot of hoops,
because computers were expensive, and
rare, and had to be heavily shared to
justify their costs.
And so in the next lecture, we're going to
start seeing how we improved how we could
share equipment, and make the sharing not
require direct dial-up the way it was in
the earliest days where you, if you wanted
to talk to a computer a thousand miles
away, you had to pay for a long distance
call.
So that we're looking at how to make
connections permanent so that we can use
these things a little more naturally
without such great expense.
So see you in a bit.
