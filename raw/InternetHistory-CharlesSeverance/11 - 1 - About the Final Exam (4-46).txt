Hi there.
I just want to give a little bit of a
video about the final exam.
I just want to thank you for taking the
time
and sticking with this course as long as
you have.
We have several thousand people still
actively on the way to a
certificate and finishing up the last
week, and then doing the final exam.
the final exam will be a little bit
different than the quizzes.
The quizzes, you've been able to
retake them over and over keeping the
highest score until the deadline.
and that's really because my goal for the
quizzes is
for you to learn and I feel like if you
take the quiz more than once, especially
the questions change
a little bit you're learning, and so
that's the idea.
the final exam, I'm going to change it.
You have a two-week period, and during
that two-week
period, you pick the time that you want to
start
the exam.
And then a 24-hour timer starts, and you
have to finish within 24 hours and submit
it.
You can log in.
You can look at the exam.
You can start answering the questions.
You can save the questions, and then you
just have to save and submit your final
answers.
The other thing that happens is the
questions don't change.
So you see one set of questions when you
first look at it, and you could print
it out, or do whatever.
And so the questions aren't going to
change, unlike the quiz,
where the questions changed every time you
took a look.
I also am trying to, and I, as best I
can to make the questions on the final
more factual.
I, I don't mind having a questions on the
mid-term, on the, on the,
on the quizzes that is kind of thought
question where it makes you think or
curious or bounce around or ask somebody
because that, that,
that triggers learning in ways that I
couldn't have imagined.
but on the final, on the final, I want you
to, you know, be able to look at the
question, and hopefully, it's a relatively
factual question and just answer it.
of course, a good way to study for the
final is to
take a look at the quizzes and look at the
quizzes you
know check the lectures again do quick
review.
That's why I give you some time.
but once you start taking the exam, once
you
start it, you have 24 hours to finish it.
And so, again, thank you.
I look forward to seeing your performance
on the exam.
And I've got a little tiny video right
after this.
that kind of takes us back to the very
beginning.
the video of Tim Berners-Lee where he
talks about
his view of the future.
By now, those of you who have done the
peer assignment, you've also shared your
view of the future.
And let's let's go back and take another
look at Tim's view of the future.
and then after that I have a graduation
video where you,
we have a graduation speaker and and you
can, you know, get your certificate
at a real live or at least real virtual
graduation ceremony.
So the end of a class is sort of, sort of
both a celebration.
A celebration of achievement,
accomplishment.
it's good the classes don't last forever.
We, we finish them and, and that's always
wonderful and fun.
but it's also kind of sad.
It's kind of sad because we've come
together
as a community and a group of people.
And it's been really wonderful and really
special.
And I miss
it as, as soon as the class is over I can
relax, but at the same time, I miss it as
well.
And hopefully, we'll find something we can
do together whether it's you
guys taking some other class on Coursera
or, or perhaps my, my Python class.
and but it has really been an honor and a
pleasure having
you in class, and I, I thank you for all
your time.
