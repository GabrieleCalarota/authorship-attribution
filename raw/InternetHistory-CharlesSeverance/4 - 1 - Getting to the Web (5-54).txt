So I started our picture where we had 
supercomputers, at the University of 
Illinois. We went to the University of 
Michigan, we 
got the NSFNet funded. 
And now we're going to fly across the 
ocean to CERN. 
CERN, of course, is a high-energy physics 
laboratory. 
They do this 26-mile circle and smash 
particles and take pictures of the 
smashing particles and looking for the 
Higgs Boson. Or found the Higgs Boson. 
It's a really cool place, I recommend 
that you visit. 
The CERN is a place that physicists from 
all over the world visit, live at, and 
collaborate with. 
For experimental physics, it really 
revolves around those experimental 
facilities. 
And so regardless of whether you live in 
Russia or Australia or Germany or America 
or Japan, 
if you're an energy nuclear physicist, 
you have got to work with CERN or spend 
time at CERN. 
And those who spent time at CERN tend to 
make the best discoveries. 
And so, these projects have such long 
lead times, and they take so many 
different kinds of talented people, you 
know they're metallurgy, welders, 
physicists, engineers, designers, project 
managers, there's a ton of people 
involved in it. 
And it's a pretty well funded operation. 
And everyone's pretty smart. So one of 
the things that they do is they have fun.
They have these clubs, like the softball 
club, the cricket club, the blues club. 
And, and it's kind of like these people 
are somewhat away from home a lot. 
And so they just have fun with each 
other. 
This is a picture that I will show you of 
the Cernettes. 
They are famous for being the first band 
photo on the web. 
Some people wonder if they're the very 
first photo on the web. 
But they are a doo-wop group and they 
sing sort of, 50s style doo-wop songs. 
They are very fun to watch. 
But their songs are about like particles 
and Internet and modems and stuff like 
that, stuff that I care a lot about. 
Sadly, they've doing this since the 
1990s you know, 90, 91, 92 kind of 
time frame. 
And they all grew up and their kids grew 
up and their kids are all in college and 
so they did their farewell tour in 2011 
and I, and one of them's moved to Australia 
so we don't know if the Cernettes are ever 
going to get back and together and sing 
but for now they're on permanent hiatus. 
But, for your viewing pleasure take a 
quick look at one or more of the 
Cernettes songs. 
So like I said, you should go visit CERN. 
I have had the great fortune to visit CERN.
I had visited CERN with on professional 
in a professional role, I helped them 
record lectures with my Sync-O-Matic 
software that you may have heard me talk 
about. 
I, I have visited sort of in helping 
other technology things and I  
teaching and learning with technology 
and things like that. 
And so they've got a a wonderful cafe. And 
if you were working with people, you get 
to go in the back and hang out. 
That's pretty cool. 
They also have a wonderful museum 
that you can go see the first web server 
and all kinds of other cool stuff. 
And in 2006, I was lucky enough to have 
an invited talk at CERN where I talked 
about Sakai and how they might use Sakai 
to do collaborative work, and I brought 
my family with me. 
And so my wife Theresa, and my daughter 
Mandy, and my son Brent, and there's me. 
we were in the pit, and this pit is like, 
like eight or nine stories underground, 
it is six stories tall. 
This is where the beam comes in right 
here. 
It's three stories from the bottom of the 
pit. The pit is six stories tall. 
At this point the it was only less than 
one-third complete and so we could go on a 
tour, and so I have a family photo with 
hardhats in the CERN Pit. 
And that's pretty cool. 
Another time I visited I went and sang 
with one of our University of Michigan 
physicists. 
And that would be this guy right here, 
his name is Steven Goldfarb. 
And he's a physicist that works on the Atlas 
project, but he also is the band leader 
of a all-physicist band called the 
Canettes blues band. 
He let me sing a song. I was coming to do 
some video work for him. 
I happened to be in the area and I just 
stopped by on one of my trips and me and 
another Michigan staffer, we grabbed a 
couple of cameras and made some music 
videos for him. 
We put the Cernettes, some of 
the Cernettes music videos up on the web 
and then they let me sing one song called 
I Got My Mojo Working and so I got 
I'll share with you the video Got My Mojo 
Working. 
That's just, oh so, everybody in this 
band is a physicist. 
And pretty much everybody dancing is a 
physicist too. 
Now the reason I'm showing you all this 
is to give you a sense of the energy and 
joy, in addition to the hard work, that 
goes on at CERN. 
So I don't know if you noticed, halfway 
through, I knew that song by heart, but I 
had still written lyrics on my hand and 
so halfway through you can see me look at 
my hand to check the lyrics that I knew. 
Made me look like a dork. 
I'm not, I really want to sing. 
I'm just not a very good singer, and 
thankfully Steve let me sing with the band. 
So, back to the topic at hand. In 1999, I 
visited CERN as one of my first tasks at 
the University of Michigan to help them 
with lecture recording. 
And I said hey I got a camera, you know, 
are the inventors of the World Wide Web 
here. 
And we still had a little bit of the 
televison show going back then. 
So I went and interviewed Robert Cailliau 
who was still at CERN. 
He was just sort of across the street 
from the cafeteria. 
And we walked in to his office and gave 
him the microphone and just started 
talking about the beginnings of the World 
Wide Web. 
And Robert Cailliau is the co-inventor of 
the World Wide Web along with Tim 
Berners-Lee who, who built it at CERN. 
So let's take a listen to Robert 
Cailliau.
