Hello, welcome to the second half of the 
welcome lecture. 
Now I want to focus a little bit more 
about the course itself. 
And so, so the material is part of a 
course that I teach at the University of 
Michigan called SI 502, which is Network 
Computing, Storage, 
Communication, and Processing. 
I also have some of these materials, it's 
also got Python in it. 
It doesn't have any Python in this class, 
there's no programming. 
So, it's really just part of this intro, 
intro technology class that I teach at 
the University of Michigan. 
It's sort of taught in the middle, I give 
students a break between the Python 
programming. 
And so this is a, a short message from 
our, our lawyers. 
And this is on the certificates or 
something like this is on the 
certificates that basically says this is 
not a University of Michigan course. 
It doesn't count for credit at the 
University of Michigan. 
It's a free course and it's for you to 
learn. 
It's not so much about credit. 
And so, enough of that. 
When I got involved in Coursera, and I 
wasn't the earliest, but I was one of the 
early folks in Coursera. 
And what I wanted to create was like a 
freshman class, like an introductory 
class. 
Like a class where we all come together 
and kind of get to know each other and 
learn something kind of fun and, and 
really enjoy getting started together. 
And I think there are other classes in 
Coursera that are more sophomore, 
junior, and senior level courses. 
But I wanted to be I wanted to be on 
early, and have some writing involved in 
it, explore the software. I 
want people to take my course and then go 
off and take other Coursera courses as 
well as other courses. 
'Cause I think a big part of education is 
getting to know people and getting 
socialized and, and understanding how an 
environment works. 
And, I have a long history of open source 
software development. 
And one thing about open source software 
development is you're supposed to be open 
to suggestions, and other, and let other 
people other than me make decisions about 
the course. 
And so, I encourage you to, you know, to 
contribute to the course, to give me 
suggestions, to tell me how I can improve 
the course. 
Sometimes I even explicitly ask you for 
help on exam questions, or help to come 
up with better homework questions, all 
kinds of things. 
I really like it when you take care of 
each other. 
A big part of these large classes is that the 
learning becomes more social. 
You can help each other faster then I can 
help you. 
Community teaching assistants, they can 
help you, as well. 
So, I tend to wait and let you guys solve 
your problems and help each other. 
And then I sort of, sort of pat people on 
the back, and tell people that they're, 
tell people if something's wrong, I'll, 
I'll try to fix it. 
But in general, I really want us to 
learn together. 
So the the backbone of the course is 
lectures. 
Recorded audio lectures, hey, like this 
one. 
I give you the lecture notes in PDF, two 
formats of PDF. 
The print one is designed if you're 
going to print these out on paper. 
The slides are smaller, and there's four 
per page, and they don't use up as much 
color ink. 
And I also give you the PowerPoint, so 
that you can either modify them, or some 
people use PowerPoint to scribble on. 
And, you, the slides are Creative Commons 
by attribution. 
And so, you can use them and reuse them 
in your own teaching. 
And that's why I give you PowerPoint, 
so you can modify them. 
Most of the videos are up on YouTube. 
You can point at them, I don't want you 
to put copies of my videos up on YouTube. 
You're allowed to download them. 
Some of the videos are copy, have 
copyright IEEE material in them. 
So, you really can't do anything except 
use them in, for the purposes of this 
class and for your own personal use. 
And they belong to IEEE, and they remain 
copyright IEEE. 
Of course, you can use them in your own 
teaching. 
You know, that's, that's totally fair, 
it's just the key is not to republish the 
material. 
So, if you borrow my slides, they're 
totally re-publishable. 
So, the class is, you know, eight, nine, 
ten weeks long with some exams. 
The syllabus has the, the detail. 
I, I expect this to be it's not like a 
three-credit college class. 
I expect three to four focused hours of 
your time per week, maybe five or two or 
more, two more hours or so, depending. 
And I'm going to make it so that in the 
first two weeks we're not moving so fast 
that people can't still join. 
So I kind of give the assignments a 
little longer in the first couple of 
weeks, and give people a bit of time to 
catch up. 
But if you have people that you want to join 
the class, you've got to get them in 
early. 
And so, we'll shut down new enrollment at 
some point. 
And people won't be able to join the 
class, and you know, maybe about three 
weeks in or something. 
And then off we go and we'll be a cohort. 
A big part of the class is the discussion 
forums, and this is both where you meet 
and find each other. 
Coursera classes often have very active 
and great discussions in the forums. 
You folks come from all over the world. 
There are thousands of people in the 
class, thousands of people active. 
And, and I really get a great deal of joy 
interacting with all of you. 
And regardless of where you're coming 
from, I think that's particularly fun. 
One of the things that I've taken to doing, 
because I have a very active travel 
schedule as a faculty member here at the 
University of Michigan. 
I do lots of speaking engagements about 
MOOCs and open source software and Sakai 
and standards, and all the things that I 
do, I get, I end up on a plane a 
lot. 
So one of the things I like to do is 
take a couple hours out and announce to 
the students in the class, I'll announce to 
you that oh, hey, I'll be in Barcelona, 
Spain, for from, you know, 10 to noon on 
a Saturday morning. 
And then people come by, and I've had 
these all over the world, New York, Los 
Angeles, Michigan, North Carolina, 
Chicago, DC. 
Seoul Korea, Barcelona, I've had them 
all over the world, and usually somewhere 
between 2 and 15 people show up,
and it's great fun. 
And so I would love, if I end up doing 
office hours, if you will show up at 
office hours. 
The way that you earn your grade is 
through assessments. There are questions 
that stop in the middle of the video, 
they do not count. 
So it doesn't really matter if you get 
them right or wrong. 
There'll be one quiz to cover each week's 
worth of material. 
That will be worth ten points. 
And the final exam, and the quizzes you 
can take over, and over, and over again, 
and hopefully your score goes up each 
time you take, you get to keep the last 
score, I think it's the last score. 
The final exam is a little 
different, and I'll send notes out about 
this. 
It's one attempt, you have 24 hours, 
but you have 24 hours within a 
two-week period. 
Once you start it, you have to finish it 
within 24 hours. 
So you don't get to take it over and 
over and over again. 
And there's three extra-credit 
assignments that are peer graded for 
writing, that are 10 points each. 
Now you don't have to do the extra 
credit. 
You'll see in a bit that the points are 
based on the percentage of the points for 
the quiz plus the final exam. 
So, peer grading is a way for you to, if 
you like, to engage more deeply in the 
material and engage more deeply in your 
fellow students. 
The extra-credit material is peer graded. 
But you don't have to do it. Your peers 
will determine your grade. 
Now the way it works is the high ones and 
the low ones are thrown out, so it's the 
middle ones. 
And so, if somebody gives you zeros, 
unless everyone gives you zeros, you'll 
get the score, the middle score. 
Not the high nor the low, it's not an 
average. 
So, you get some low scores, those low 
scores are basically thrown away. 
And so, you've got to write your 
submission knowing that it's your fellow 
students that are going to judge you. 
I'm not going to come in with thousands 
of assignments and regrade them if you 
disagree with the grades. 
So you've got to write with your 
audience in mind. 
And so in the course if you get, not 
including the extra credit. 
The extra credit is just added on. 
But basically the total for the assignments 
plus the total for the exam, is how I'm 
going to calculate the course percentage. 
So I take the total you learn, earn on 
the assignments, 10 a week. 
The total on the exam, say if the exam 
was 30. 
So there's 7 assignments times 10, 30. 
And then so 7 times 10 and 30, in this 
case 100, is the denominator. 
And then we add to that on the numerator, 
we add the extra credit. 
So, if you don't do the extra credit at 
all you have up to 100 points, right? 
100 points, 100%. 
The extra credit, and you might not get a 
10 on every one of the extra credits. 
But the extra credit is just extra 
credit, it's added on. 
And so, after I do this calculation, I 
guess we can clear this here. 
After I do this calculation right here, 
that percentage, which might be over 
100%, if you've done extra credit 
assignments. 
If you're above 75%, you're going to get 
a certificate. 
And if you're above 85%, you get a 
certificate with distinction. 
Now, if you really want a certificate, 
don't plan on getting exactly 75% or 
74.99% and then do a bunch of 
complaining. Okay?
This is about learning, but if you want 
to get the certificate, don't shoot for 
the low level. Or the same thing, 
if you end up with 84.99, you know, 
don't, I, just earn the certificate, get 
the points, don't let it be close, okay? 
So, 75% for a certificate, 85% for a
certificate with distinction and there 
will be no individual regrades or point 
appeals, or if you think your peers are 
completely confused and misgraded you. 
Just do the next assignment, right? 
So, that's part of the reason that I made 
peer grading extra credit. 
So, as I mentioned, you're supposed to 
help each other. 
And you'll help each other a lot. 
I mean, the questions in the forums in 
one class get answered 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week, in an average of 21 
minutes. 
And that's because often the people who 
know the answers to your question the 
best are maybe in the time, same time 
zone as you are, and taking the class at 
exactly the same time you are. 
So, ask the questions in the forum, the 
answers will often come in the forum. 
And on the quizzes if you have some 
confusion, or you have some clarification 
that you need, talk about it, you know the 
people could just sit and take the 
quizzes over and over eventually get 10 
out of 10. 
So, we don't think of the quizzes as 
highly sensitive material. 
You tend not to just put all your quiz 
questions and then your answers in the 
forum, that would be tacky. 
But you know, just if somebody has a 
problem with question seven, and there's 
some confusion, you know, don't worry 
about being highly sensitive or secure 
about it. 
Say, oh I'm having problems with question 
seven. 
I think that C is the answer, but I don't 
quite understand why packets aren't also 
streams, or something like that. 
So, the quizzes are designed 
often to have thought questions. 
And so, in the curiosity that goes around 
solving some of the quiz questions, you 
can, can learn some. 
Plagiarism is an important thing in this 
course. 
The place where this pops up is in the 
writing part, the peer, the peer grading. 
And my definition of plagiarism is 
basically taking material verbatim. 
Without sort of re-expressing it and 
pasting it in as if it were your own 
material without 
attribution. 
So you, you can put a little quote in, 
but you gotta put it in quotes, and say 
blah blah blah blah blah, Winston 
Churchill, or whatever, okay? 
So it's, it's not plagiarism to put 
something in, it's plagiarism to put 
something then and claim it as though you 
wrote it. 
The most common thing is people will 
start taking paragraphs from Wikipedia and 
putting them in, and we will mark them 
off. 
We will mark half off, if there's a 
little bit of plagiarism, and if it's all 
plagiarized, then you get 10 off. 
Now, there are going to be five people 
grading this. 
And so you know one person might think 
it's plagiarism, and if nobody else does 
then you know your grade won't be, your 
grade will reflect what the average, or 
what the median person came up with, not 
what the low person came up with. 
So, we also have an honor code in the 
class, the key that this really has to do 
with the final, you're not supposed to 
give nor get help on the final. 
It's open book, it's open notes, it's 
open network, you can look at the 
quizzes, you can look at the the videos, 
you can do anything you want. 
What you can't do is just give the 
questions to somebody else and ask for 
the answers from them, or have them take 
the test for you. 
Even on the quiz, you're supposed to 
pretty much do it yourself, but you can 
ask people for help if you need some help 
or clarification on the quiz questions. 
Again, the quizzes really are more about 
learning and the final exam is more about 
measurement. 
And like I said, if you get about 75%, 
you get a Statement of Accomplishment. 
There are two levels, one is normal and 
one with distinction. 
As I mentioned, 75% and 85%, and the 
syllabus has the exact details on how 
many points, given the total number of 
points. 
And that's a Statement of Accomplishment. 
And this is at no charge. 
There is no charge for the Statement of 
Accomplishment. 
If you finish, you get this absolutely at 
no charge. 
If, on the other hand, you want something 
a little nicer, Coursera has a identity 
verification mechanism. 
So, part of the problem with the 
statement of accomplishment is it says we 
did not verify your identity at the very 
bottom. 
It's like that lawyer stuff at the very 
beginning. 
And so this small charge for the 
signature track is because they're 
going to put some effort into, 
you have to kind of, you know, show them 
your passport on a camera, and then type, 
they do things to figure out who you are, 
and they check to make sure it's you 
every time a quiz is being taken. 
And there's a small charge for this, it is 
optional, optional, optional. 
Do not feel you need to do this. 
If you want it, great. 
And if you're in a situation where 
you can't financially afford it, there's 
also scholarships available and you can 
apply for those at the Coursera site. 
Now, this is a way for those who can 
easily afford it, who really don't care 
and have money to spend, it's a way of 
saying thank you. 
I don't exactly how it's going to work. 
But someday, they tell me, I might get a 
tiny bit of the money from this. 
I mean, most of it's going to go to 
Coursera, because they're the ones 
building all of the servers and stuff 
that we're using for this, which is 
totally awesome. 
And some of it goes to University of 
Michigan. 
And some goes to little old me at some 
point, right. 
And so, so who knows, if you buy one of 
these things, I might come and buy you a 
cup of coffee in office hours in Peru 
someday. 
If I get to Peru. But don't feel any 
pressure. 
I mean it's, it's no big deal. 
I mean this is aimed at being free. 
but if you want, you can do this. 
So I love the fact that it's optional. 
That's what's beautiful about the 
signature track. 
I don't do anything different for 
signature track. 
It's not like we have special signature 
track parties where we all hang out, 
like, oh, welcome to the signature track 
party. 
No, it's the same as everybody else. 
And it's really optional, and it's, it 
gives you a little stronger statement 
that says we have verified the identify 
of this person and the name on this 
certificate is this actual person. 
Because you could sign up and call 
yourself Batman. 
And that would not be good. 
But they wouldn't give you a signature 
track named Batman, unless you really 
were the Batman. 
Okay, so I hope you get that, optional, 
optional, optional, it's nice, but 
optional. 
So, given that there's always thousands 
of students in the class, it's not really 
practical to send me direct email. 
You may find that you'll catch, there's, 
like, if you go to drchuck.com, you may 
actually catch me online, where you can talk 
to me right interactively. 
The most reliable way to catch me is on 
Twitter. 
If you tweet something with @drchuck in 
it, usually, unless I'm sitting in a 
meeting, like right now, within five to 
ten minutes I will see it on this. 
So I watch my Twitter very carefully, 
where I, no matter where I'm at, all 
around the world. 
And if you mention Dr. Chuck, I see it. 
I want you to contact me if something's 
wrong, right? If, if question, so what 
usually happens is I make a quiz and 
question three has no right answer. 
And you all figure it out really fast, 
and there's like in the forums, there's 
like this, oh, the answer to question 
three is wrong. 
Well, somebody needs to tell me question 
three is wrong, so tweet like, hey Dr. 
Chuck, the forums are on fire, question 
three is wrong. 
And I go, whoa, and I go fix it and it's 
all calmed up. 
So when things are broken in the course 
that I can fix, I want to know about it 
right away. 
And so that's what is Twitter is good for. 
Not everyone has to be using Twitter, 
but somebody has to notice it and let me 
know. 
So, as I mentioned, in the first couple 
weeks we're going to have the 
registration open, but then we're 
going to close it down. 
You can watch the first lecture or two 
and kind of see if you think the course 
is going to be worthwhile. 
And if you think it's cool, then bring 
people. 
That's people to help you work through 
it. 
And so I've tried to make it so that you 
can join in the first few weeks and still 
get all the credit, okay? 
So bring your friends, but bring them 
early. 
And if they're too late, then they have 
to register for a later one. 
We also have a Facebook group 
for the class. 
It's totally optional, I didn't make it. 
I don't run it, I post to it every once 
in a awhile. 
I don't quite know why people do Facebook 
groups, but they do and there's one for 
this course. 
And so, we have some materials that I use 
in this course that I use with 
permission. Some of the papers that I 
give you come from IEEE Computer 
magazine. 
And I have permission to use them within 
this class that, doesn't mean that you 
have permission to republish them, but 
you're, you're allowed to use them for 
the class. 
Richard Wiggins, my co-host for the 
television show, has some materials that 
I use in class and I have his permission. 
And the folks at Open Michigan, 
open.umich.edu, have helped me in the 
copyright clearance of my slides and 
other course materials, which I think is 
really good. 
So, this for me, even though we've done 
it a couple of times now, is I'm still 
curious. 
I'm still very curious of this form, and 
so you, please help me, you know, give me 
suggestions, tell me how to improve this 
class. 
You know, you can say it's terrible. 
That's not too helpful, but if you can 
say, you know, this would work better if, 
and sometimes I'll just send you 
questions and say hey, how do you think I 
could improve x, y, or z? 
And so I, I don't think this class is 
ever at the point where it does not need 
any more improvement. 
I'm a big fan of open source software and 
open education resources. 
My slides are Creative Commons by 
attribution, and I give them to you in 
PowerPoint format, so you can edit them. 
You can use one of them, you can use all 
of them. 
I really want to help you, if you're 
possibly a teacher, to be able to reteach 
this material, or use parts of this 
material. 
So, I'd be honored if you reused my 
material. 
The course videos are available, they're 
available on YouTube, so you can point to 
them. 
I'll give you later a YouTube, when the 
class finishes, I'll give you a YouTube 
channel that has them all together 
bundled up nicely. 
And if you look you'll see as each 
lecture comes up, there's a YouTube link 
for it. 
and it's a violation of Coursera terms to 
take any of the videos, like the IEEE 
video or even my lecture videos. 
Anything that you get from any of the 
Coursera class, you're downloading them 
for your own personal use. 
You're not supposed to like, make your 
own YouTube channel from my, or anyone 
else's Coursera course. 
So, if you if we find that you're, like, 
trying to make YouTube channels out of 
Coursera courses, then you kind of get in 
some trouble. 
So, I do want you to reuse them, right. 
I want you to, you know, use my stuff in 
your own classes, but I don't want you to 
sort of publish your own YouTube channel 
that is your version of my class. 
And so, so with that, let's go ahead and 
get started. 
And welcome to Internet History, 
Technology and Security. 
And up next, we have our first real live 
lecture. 
Thanks.
