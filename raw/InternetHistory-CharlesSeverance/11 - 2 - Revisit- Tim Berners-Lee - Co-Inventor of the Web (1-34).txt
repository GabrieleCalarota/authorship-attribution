Last month I was off in Boston for the
fourth Annual World Wide Web Conference
and I had the opportunity to talk to the
inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim
Berners-Lee and I asked him a little bit
about where we're going with this web
stuff. And we have just a little bit of
footage from Tim telling us where that's
going to be. ≫> You're waiting until
people consume the web. When the web
becomes that you can consume when the web,
and the infrastructure is all laid down or
we have the information space, then it
would be time for the next revolution
[inaudible]. ≫> It's hard to imagine
a greater revolution that what we are
seeing I mean, I mean the smallest places
and everybody is putting up a web page.
≫> Right. And the web could only
take place, the revolution can only take
place because the Internet which would be
the quantitative smaller revolution but
the Internet itself quite being deployed
for that role had happened because the
internet was something people consume, the
web revolution can take place. When the
web is something you consume then maybe
the cultural revolution and I said
cultural revolution, when we come to
revolution so, or then you go find ways to
do things better than we have imagined.
≫> Pretty neat which one of the
things that I, I liked about it was he, he
just said, we're going to, his idea was
the next step is something completely
different, a cultural revolution as
compared to just little more technology
and he Tim Berners-Lee being from Europe I
can sort of see how he, he could have that
perspective. That it's going to change our
culture. ≫> Well, I guess we don't
know what's going to happen in five years
or even in two but, let's find out what's
going to happen in the rest of the show.
