[SOUND].
In this session, we are going to introduce
an interesting seam in the advanced topics
on pattern mining, which is spatiotemporal
and trajectory pattern mining.
And we have lots of data now associated
with spatiotemporal trajectories.
For example, sensors, smartphones eh,
there are lots of GPS devices.
Okay?
So we first want to see how
to mine spatial patterns and
their association rules.
We probably can think about spatial
pattern and association rule in this form.
A and B are frequent patterns.
You may want to see the rule,
like A implies B with certain support and
confidence.
And A and B could be spatial or
non-spatial predicates.
For example,
they could be topological relations like,
intersects, overlaps, and disjoint.
They could be,
spatial orientations like, left,
right, west, east, or under,
above, or remote, or something.
Then you also can have distance
information like close_to,
within certain distances,
you know, those relationships.
Okay, and support of confidence or
correlation there, lots of interesting
measures we can associate them with
your spatial rules or patterns.
For example, likely you may
find certain things like this.
If x is a large_town, and
x intersects with highway,
than likely x is adjacent to water.
Okay.
So this you may have certain support and
certain confidence of this rule.
Another important thing for
spatial pattern mining is we shall
explore spatial autocorrelation.
What is spatial autocorrelation?
Basically, we say the spatial data
tends to be highly self-correlated.
That means the nearby things are more
related than the distance ones.
People often say everything is related.
But the close by things are more
related than the far away things.
Okay, this is like common sense,
but it's very useful.
For example,
you can use neighborhood information
even when you study temperature.
Maybe the closer by one will be
closer in temperature as well, okay?
So there are lots of properties we
can explore to increase the power and
efficiency of mining.
So we first introduce a general
principle called progressive
refinement in mining spatial associations.
Usually even for spatial predicates or
relationships, there is
something more general.
For example, general close_to that means
as now they are somewhat close by.
You will say they are,
they are geographically close to, okay.
But you also may study a little more
detail, whether they are nearby, or
they really touch, or they intersect,
or one contains the other.
Okay.
But you may say,
I first mine the very rough ones.
That means we first search rough patterns.
Then we find they are patterns.
Then we may refine to see what
exactly pattern they are,
like exactly relationship.
You may first get a generalized
geographically close to.
Then you see whether they are nearby or
they really touch each other or
they intersect or one contains the other.
So that act to refinement
will save a lot of processing
power to focus on those
unrelated things to do very
expensive spatial relationship
computation, okay.
That means we can do two-step
mining of spatial association.
One is we may do rough
spatial computation.
So as a filter that means there's
more like close by, general close by.
You can first do very rough computation.
How do you to compute it?
For example, you may use some
interesting data structure like
a Minimum Bounding Rectangle or
R-tree to do rough computation
to find the rough patterns.
That assume that you will
have less computation,
you know expense because you
just use some inherent or
given data structure you can compute it.
Then after you find those rough patterns,
you may want to refine it.
Find a more refined patterns
like whether they intersect or
whether one contains the other or
they touch each other.
So in that sense, you may apply those
objects passed the rough pattern.
Then you, you may,
you may do more detailed computation.
For example, for this graph,
what we can see is we,
you can assume these rectangles
are shopping centers.
And these circular ones are gas stations,
and those lines are the highways.
Okay, then you may first to find
close by maybe you will find pattern
say gas station in general is very close
geographic close by shopping centers.
Okay, then after you find those,
you may refine it.
You say how close they are by whether
they are really, really just nearby or
they touch each other or
one contain inside the other.
So you may, you may give more
detail refined the rules.
Okay?
So
that's eh, actually we'll save the cost.
You try to find all kinds of patterns
in all the different places.
Those computation could
be rather expensive.
Okay?
Another interesting thing
we may want to study
is related to the trajectories we
call relative movement patterns.
That means you may find some objects
during the time of movement,
they keep close together.
For example suppose this is a timestamp.
You get timestamp t1, t2, t3, and t4.
Okay.
You may find a group objects in the space
like these are the, the maps okay.
So you find that they are geographically
close by during the moments.
That means in t1 they are close by,
you get t2 they may also be close by.
You may want to find this.
One definition could be flock.
The flock is, you find these m
entities like m objects, okay,
animals or, you know, people.
They are within the circular region
of radius during the movement.
That means they move in the same
direction every time you check them,
you see they are all within
certain radius like r.
'Kay.
You, then you say they are flocks.
'Kay.
For example, you may find deer or sheep.
Those moments you may find
they really found flocks.
'Kay.
And another interesting pattern
you want to find could be convoy.
The convoy means they're not
necessary within a rigorous
circle like radius, but
overall they form clusters.
If you use density-based clustering,
at every timestamp you are going
to find they form clusters.
For example, you may find better shapes.
You may find those better
shapes they could be sometimes
maybe have a pretty big radius.
You just look at their relative distance.
But they form clusters so the,
you find density-based clustering.
These are the convoys.
Okay?
But flocks and
convoys in their definition,
they require at least a k
consecutive time stamps.
They always be together.
But in reality, if you look at this case,
like this particular graph,
you may see sometimes
they're getting together,
like from if you look at time t1 to t4,
they are getting together.
But if you look at t2 and t3,
sometimes they are a little far apart.
So we may define another interesting
movement pattern called swarm.
Swarm is like a bees.
They, the, the big swarm,
they may move in the same directions.
But on the other hand, you,
if you look at every particular second,
okay, they may be far apart
in certain time stamps.
Actually, even you think about it,
sheep or
deer, you may find a certain time
they graze in a rather wide field.
But sometimes when they start moving,
they form flocks, again.
Okay.
So, since this swarm,
has less constraints on consecutive
time stamps, so there are potential
pattern try to find swarm and more.
But the computation is
also more expensive.
So there are studies on how to use
efficient pattern mining algorithms
to uncover such swarm patterns.
The detail can read the paper.
But you can see those different
definitions leads to different
processing efficiency in
the design of the algorithms.
Another interesting pattern in
spatiotemporal trajectory pattern
is periodic patterns.
Look at,
let's look at a one interesting example.
'Kay?
This one actually is a three-year
bird migration data.
But they are very sparse, in the sense.
When you put a sensor on the bird, okay,
this sensor will send you very sparse
signals because if you send dense signals,
the battery will drain out very quickly.
You assume for this tiny battery,
they may last for a year.
Then the only way you can
have the battery last for
a year is you do very sparse sampling and
sending out very sparse signals.
For example,
you may only do 24 hours one sample.
And every seven days or ten days,
you may shift to the satellite only once.
In that sense,
24 hours of birds can fly very far away so
you get a very sparse patterns.
Okay.
For such sparse pattern,
how could you find their migration
pattern every year to year?
So the interesting thing is you,
if you try to find their periodicity and
check their patterns,
you had to use different methods because
unlikely you find the two sample
points they'd really overlay.
It's impossible almost.
So, that means if you try to find
the periodic patterns without, you know,
further thinking, you just directly use
Fourier Transform and auto-correlation.
It's almost impossible you
can find good patterns.
But, if you think about it,
some samples, they form clusters.
Year after year you may find clusters.
And for these clusters if you treat,
you know,
the big amount of those clusters as
dense point, as a reference point,
a single point, then you may see
when they are going to get in,
when they are going to
get out of this cluster.
And then you look at their time, and
year after year you will be able to
clearly identify their periodic patterns.
Okay?
That's the reason if you
change your algorithm finding
dense clusters and
treating dense cluster as single points,
then you study their periodicity using
a Fourier Transform and auto-correlation.
You are going to detect,
nicely detecting those periods.
After detecting periods,
based on those periods,
you can summarize their trajectory
patterns, you may find it
nice patterns even
the data is very sparse.
For example in this study, you can see you
were based on different cluster points.
You may find there pattern every
time from January to March,
April to June,
what is the thing that can be overlaid.
You'll find nice patterns.
Okay, this is why interesting study
how to mine periodic patterns
with very sparse data.
Okay?
Another line of interesting
study is finding semantic
trajectories in spatiotemporal domain.
Okay?
Actually, there are lots of people,
for example, you,
you trace people's you know,
movement patterns.
You'll find lots of people,
they start in the morning from home.
They go to Starbucks.
Then they go to office, then they go
to restaurant, then they go to cafe,
then go to restaurant for
dinner, then go to bar.
Suppose you find these,
you won't find such patterns.
The interesting thing is, there are so
many people that go to different
Starbucks, they go to different offices,
they go to different restaurants.
How could you find such a pattern
in the spatiotemporal domain?
Okay.
The interesting thing is,
we may try to find the seq, meaningful
sequential patterns by observe certain
constraints, like a semantic constr,
consistency, spatial compactness,
and temporal continuity.
We can also adopt two-step approach,
like a progressive refinement,
this kind of philosophy.
That means first, you try to mine coarse
patterns that satisfy the semantic and
temporal constraints.
Remember, this time is
different from spatial
where you just find a rough spatial one.
Actually what you want to find is
is suppose you first even
ignore the spatial domain.
You just look at the semantic and
temporal domain.
You may find the people semantic
try to create like this.
That means you first mine
semantically meaningful patterns.
Then, you try to detect dense and compact
clusters in the high-dimension space.
And then you may split the coarse pattern
into fine-grained ones to meet
certain spatial constraints.
For example, you may be able find,
first find it people
actually from the office at certain
points they want to go to a gym.
That's a frequent pattern.
Then you may want to
study which offices or
which kind of people
want to go to which gym.
So these are the you know, first finding
semantic meaningful trajectories.
Then refine them,
using more spatiotemporal information
finding their sub patterns which
may get a fine pattern mined.
This, one such study
called splitter actually
work out some efficient
algorithm to mine such patterns.
Overall, spatiotemporal and the trajectory
pattern mining is a pretty rich domain.
There are lots of studies on it.
And here we just introduced
a few interesting algorithms.
And we also going to just
introduce some survey papers and
some books you may like to read,
to do in-depth study on them as well.
Thank you.
