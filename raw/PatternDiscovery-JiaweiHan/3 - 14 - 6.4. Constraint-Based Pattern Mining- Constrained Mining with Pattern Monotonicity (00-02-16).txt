Let me introduce another pattern space
constraint called pattern monotonicity.
You may first want to know,
what is pattern monotonicity constraint?
We say a constraint c is pattern monotone,
in a sense if a pattern, item set S,
satisfy these constraints.
Then any of a superset also
satisfy the same constraint.
Then this constraint is pattern monotone.
How to use these constraints?
That means we will not need to check
the c as long as this pattern S satisfies
this constraint, then we're not need
to check it again in subsequent mining.
So let's look at the first one.
The first constraint is monotone.
Why?
because this item set is price,
sum up together, suppose it's
greater than the value at $50.
Then you add more items into this items
at S, the price will only increase.
So it will always satisfy the $50, so
you don't need to check it anymore.
So this is the first example.
The second example is, this item in S,
it's minimum price is less than $10.
Then you add more items into it.
The minimum price we're still less
than $10, so it is still monotone.
Let's look at third example.
Suppose this item sets,
it's profit range is greater than $15,
you add more items in.
It's profit range will
still be greater than $15.
For example, ab, their profit range is 40.
They satisfy this c sub 3, then you add
any items in the price range would go,
profit range will go even higher,
so you will still satisfy this one.
So we may find also many item sets.
This patterns, many constraints
could be monotone as well.
