Now, we study another interesting issue
called Mining Negative Correlations.
So we first need to distinguish rare
patterns and negative patterns.
What is a rare pattern?
Rare pattern usually means there
are some rare occurring items.
They have very low support but
they are interesting.
You want to catch such patterns.
For example, buying Rolex watches,
how to mine such patterns?
We previously already discussed this.
It's for different items, it's like for
those rare items we should be
able to set some individualized,
group-based min-support threshold.
That means for rare patterns,
for just those items,
we should set a rather low minimum support
threshold, then we will be able to capture
such patterns, but negative patterns
could be another very different one.
Negative pattern means, those patterns,
they are negatively correlated, that
means they are unlikely happen together.
So for example, if you find some customer,
the same customer,
who buys Ford Expedition, which is
a SUV car, and also a Ford Fusion,
a hybrid car together, so
they are unlikely to happen together, so
we call these patterns
negative correlated patterns.
The problem become how
to define such patterns.
We may have one support-based definition,
like this.
We say, if the itemsets A and
B getting together,
their support is far less than
support of A times support of B.
That means a chance to get together
is far less than random, 'kay?
Then we can say A and B are negatively
correlated, is this a good definition?
Actually this definition may
remind us the definition of lift,
then we may see whether they work well for
large transaction datasets.
Let's look at one example,
suppose a store sold two needle packages,
A and B, 100 times each, but only one
transaction containing both A and B, 'kay?
Then we will see these
two needle packages A and
B are likely negatively correlated but
when there are in total only 200
transactions in your datasets, you may
see support A and B getting together
because they've got only one time,
so 1 over 200, you get this number.
This is a pretty small number, 'kay?
But then you look at support of
A which is 100 over 200 transactions,
so it's 0.5, same as support of B so
their product should be 0.25.
So this number is far bigger than this.
That means support of A and B getting
together is far less than support
of A times support of B so we can easily
say A and B are negatively correlated.
They are negatively correlated patterns,
okay, but when this store
sold in total 10 to the power of 5,
that means 100,000 transactions.
Then suppose all the others does
not contain package of A nor B,
then the situation could be completely
different because suppose A and
B together is 1 over 10 to the power of 5,
but support A now is 100 over 100,000.
So you get a 1 over 1,000.
Support B is also 1 over 1,000.
Once they time together,
you get a 1 over 10 to the power of 6.
This number is even smaller than A and
B getting together.
Though you may say, oh, A and
B getting together is very frequent or
it's particle related, actually it's not.
What's the problem?
The problem actually is null
transactions because there are so
many transactions that contain neither
A nor B, they are null transactions,
okay, so
we probably can see a good definition on
negative correlation should take
care of the null-invariance problem.
That means when two itemsets A and
B are negatively correlated,
they should not be influenced, okay,
whether they are negative correlated or
not, they should not be influenced
by the number of null transactions.
Okay, now we give you another
interesting definition, which is,
Kulczynski measure-based definition.
That means, if we want to say A and
B whether they are negative correlated,
what we need to see is A and
B are frequent but the condition,
the probability of A under condition of B,
and
the probability of B under condition of A,
their average should be less
than epsilon, where epsilon is a small,
negative pattern support threshold.
Then we probably can see A and
B negatively correlated can be justified
for our needle package problem.
We can see, no matter they are in total
200 transactions or 100,000 transactions,
if we say, if sum is 0.01,
what we can see, this
Kulczynski measure-based judgment, we can
easily see the average of the conditional
probability should be less than epsilon,
so they are negatively correlated.
So this seems to be a very interesting and
a good definition, and how to mine them.
Actually these are the methods similar to
our previously discussed
package mining method.
We'll not discuss it further.
