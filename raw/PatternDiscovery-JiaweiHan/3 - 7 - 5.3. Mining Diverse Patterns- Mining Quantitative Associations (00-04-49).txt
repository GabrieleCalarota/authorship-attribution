[SOUND] Now,
we come down to study another interesting
issue called mining
quantitative associations.
What is quantitative association?
Quantitative association
means some attributes,
actual numerical data like age and salary.
So how to mine such rules?
There's one way,
is we can do static discretization.
The reason we need to do
static discretization is,
if you do not discretize them, you try
to parallelize every possible age and
salary, you will not be able
to find any interesting or
sensitive rules with sufficient support.
But if we try to,
say we partition age every 10 years or
partition income every $10,000 using
some predefined concept of hierarchy,
we're going to be able to
construct a data cube and
we're going to be able to generate
some interesting association.
But these fixed,
predefined concept of hierarchy may
not fit your data distribution.
For example, in the university,
likely you may want to partition the age.
For students you may say it's 18 to 20,
20 to 22, or something like that.
But for income, you may say $10,000
is one partition, or low and high.
But if you go to hospital, there age
distribution you may like to say,
you know, middle aged, old, or young.
So, another way is we do
clustering based on data.
That means we take every dimension,
we study their distribution of the age and
income, we perform certain clustering
algorithms, generate a few clusters.
And then we find the parallelized,
you know,
a frequent pattern of each
such clustered pairs.
Then finally there's also popular
way is to do deviation analysis.
That means instead of doing fixed
interval, we may do, you know,
based on certain condition like gender
is female, we may find their mean or,
you know, like a median or
something, some statistic measure.
You will find if the wage mean
is substantially deviant from
the overall mean,
then this could be an interesting rule.
Let's go a little further to see
how to find some such deviation.
We also call extraordinary or
interesting phenomena.
Usually for this, when we may say the left
hand side is the subset of the population,
and the right hand side is some
kind of extraordinary behavior,
expressed using some statistical measure
which could deviate from the overall.
Then, the rule, whether it's true,
or is just a, you know,
very exceptional case, we need to do
some statistic test like a Z-test to
confirm whether such kind of
rule is of high confidence.
Further, in many cases
you may even want to
go deeper to get a subset
of the population.
For example,
not only look at the gender as female, but
look at the location as south.
You may get a, the wage may further
deviate from the overall mean, or
even from the bigger or,
like a gender is female.
So that sub-rule could become
a extraordinary sub-rule associated with
its super rule.
For example, sometimes you do not have the
left hand side as a subset of population,
but you can,
based on numerical data, you can group
them into certain intervals or clusters.
For example, the left hand
side could be if the education
has pretty many years like 14 to 18 years,
and
you will find a mean wage actually is,
is substantially higher than the mean.
So that may form another
interesting quantitative rule.
Efficient methods actually
have been developed to
mine such extraordinary rules.
For example,
one research paper published by Aumann and
Lindell@KDD'99 is a very interesting case
study of a very interesting algorithm.
