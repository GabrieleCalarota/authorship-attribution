[SOUND] Now I'm going to introduce
an interesting algorithm called GSP.
It's apriori-based sequential
pattern mining method.
This method is pretty simple, okay.
You start from a sequence database, okay.
Then you first try to get the singleton
sequences like the first one appears.
That means you scan database once,
you count every single
item it occurred in every sequence.
Then you probably see a occurs 3 times,
b occurred 5 times.
So if you said minimum support is 2,
likely g and h will be gone because
their support is only 1, 'kay.
Then you find frequent length 1
subsequence a, b, c, d, e, f.
With this, you can combine them
as candidate subsequences.
You may have aa, ab, ac, ba, bb, bc.
Remember, aa is still important, it means
you first buy a, and buy another a.
Then, for the, for the shopping basket,
you may get ab together.
That's why you may have ab as one event,
one element, ac is another one element.
You may get these kind of subsequences.
In total, you will get 6 by 6.
There you get know, 6 by 5 divided by 2,
you'll get this number of
candidate size 2 sequence.
But without apriori, without this
pruning you will get much more, so
even this minimal pruning still can
reduce search space substantially.
So in general,
we can work out the algorithm like this.
You put this one into a loop.
St the beginning,
you can scan to find length-k,
which is lengh 1 frequent sequence.
Then based on the apriori,
you can generate a length 2 or
length-k plus 1 candidate sequence.
Then you can go back to check and
find the real frequent sequence,
then you go back to do
the apriori-based candidate generation.
So generation test, you can go into
the loop until no frequent sequence or
no candidates can be found.
So if you look at the execution
sequence for this particular data set,
you'll find at the very beginning you get
a, b, c, d, e, f and g, h will be gone.
They are painted in blue.
So then you can, from here you can go up,
you get a frequent length 2 subsequences.
Then you can generate length 3,
length 4, len, length 5,
and here you cannot go along anymore,
okay.
So this is the GSP algorithm.
