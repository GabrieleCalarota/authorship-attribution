[SOUND] In this lecture, we're going
to discuss how to evaluate patterns.
We're going to introduce interestingness
measures in pattern mining.
Especially, we're going to
discuss lift and high square.
That's two popularly used
interestingness measures.
Especially, we're going to introduce
null-invariant measures and
compare all those
interestingness measures.
The first thing we want to
discuss is the limitation of
the support confidence framework.
As we know, pattern-mining may
generate a large number of rules,
but not all of the patterns and
rules generated are interesting.
In general, we can classify
the interesting measures into two
classes: objective versus subjective.
For objective measure, like support,
confidence, correlation are defined
by mathematical formulas not
changed from person to person, but
the subjective measure may
change from person to person,
because one man's trash could
be another man's treasure.
So, the first thing is, we really want
the user to say what do you like to see.
So, it's query-based.
Another thing is we may base
on users' knowledge-base.
Try to mine something unexpected,
fresh, or recent, or
we can map patterns and
rows into two dimension space,
let users interactively pick
some interesting things.
So we know we have support and
confidence as two interesting as
measures in association rules.
So we may be careful about this
because not all the strong support and
confidence rules are interesting.
For example, think of the following table,
it's a two-way contingency table,
to look at this to see how to
interpret things we found.
For example, in this table,
400 out of 1,000 students playing
basketball and eating cereal.
But 200 students, they play basketball,
but they may not eat cereal.
Okay.
In this one,
you may derive association rule like this.
Playing basketball implies eating cereal.
You probably will get a 40% support,
because it's 400 over 1,000.
You'll get two-thirds of the confidence,
because you get 400 over 600, so this
is pretty high support and confidence.
And this rule interesting.
Let me try another rule we generated.
Actually, you will see,
if we say not playing basketball,
eating cereal, you will see
not playing basketball is 35%.
But the confidence even higher
because you know, they have 350
eating cereal out of 400 people,
so this one is even higher.
So if you recommend these two rules to the
cereal company, they will get confused.
They say, oh, the first rule said I
better give them free basketball.
Because if they play basketball you know,
eating cereal.
The second rule say I better
take their basketball away,
they actually eat cereal even more.
Which way is right?
Let's examine it.
