[SOUND] Now we come down to
another interesting issue is
Mining Multi-Dimensional Association
rules.
Sometimes the items or
the things we want to mine actually
sitting on Multi-dimensions.
The Single-dimension rule we studied, for
example, X buys milk then X buys bread.
Milk and bread, those are from the same
kind of dimension called product.
But sometimes we may get
a Multi-dimensional association rules.
For example, for this Inter-dimensional
association rule like,
if X age is 18 to 12, 25 and
if X occupation is a student.
Then likely X going to buy a Coke.
That one, actually,
age, occupation and items to buy
are three different dimensions.
That kind of rule we call
Inter-dimensional association rules.
Then, even we look at this,
sometimes we see the Hybrid cases.
Like if X age is 18 to 25, if X buys
popcorn, likely X is going to buy a Coke.
That kind of rule,
you have H is one dimension, but
these two buys are sitting
on the same dimensions.
Okay, so if you see this kind
of cases they likely these three
different cases may slightly need
different kind of algorithms.
Another thing is that the attributes
can be Categorical, can be Numerical.
For example the categorical
case could be product like
endeavors, and you may have profession
like a student to professor.
So for this for this Categorical
Attributes we can for Multi-dimension and
Inter-dimension association rule.
We can insert a data cube
to mine such things or
just use data cube structure to
mine such association efficiently.
Then another case could be
Quantitative Attributes.
So or we can say those attributes
are Numerical data, for
example age, salary or some other things.
For these cases, quite often we
may use discretization measure,
clustering measure some kind
of gradient approaches.
We're going to discuss this part in
the quantitive association rule mining.
Thank you.
