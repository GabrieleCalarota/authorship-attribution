[SOUND] In this session,
I'm going to introduce you
another interesting application
of pattern discovery,
called Pattern Discovery for
Image Analysis.
We know image analysis or computer vision,
there have been lots of techniques
developed in this field.
Then for,
there's one interesting recent line of
work is using Visual Pattern Discovery
to do image analysis.
We can take this picture as a example.
For this image we may find
there are many interest points.
These interest points we
call visual primitives.
Every visual primitives can be
described by a set of visual features.
Or you can think it's a,
a high dimension visual feature vector.
And then each image is
a collection of visual primitives.
Then we'll study how to turn those
visual primitives into patterns,
and how to do pattern mining you know,
on large number of images.
So that is, we'll understudy
visual patterns discovery problem.
For a visual patterns
discovery we can think about
from these images we can
use feature extraction.
We can extract lots of high-dimension
features away from visual primitives.
Those visual primitives can be
clustered based on their space.
They may cluster into visual items, okay?
Those visual items, if they are similar
then the belong to the same item.
You can map them into different
to a item ID, for example,
you can map this feature into W,
and maybe another picture I
have of a similar one,
they actually also called W, okay.
Then each visual primitive they can
have based on the primitive's neighbor,
they can form small clusters and
those we usually call them a Transaction.
'Kay, for example,
you may find these three eh,
visual primitives can form a transaction,
like CBA as a transaction.
Then a image may have many transactions,
'kay, in, in every image.
Then if there are many, many images
you may based on their transactions,
you do the frequent pattern mining, you
will be able to find some visual patterns.
For example in these pictures
you may find a BA and CA.
Actually are quite frequent
together in those transactions.
So you can say B and CA or
CBA are frequent patterns.
Are the frequent visual
patterns in those images.
So the, the simple example could be this.
Suppose we have four pictures,
each picture you may find know
certain primitive,
visual primitives for items.
Those items, the, based on the nearest
neighbor, you'll, they form transactions.
Then for this car, you may find the two
transactions here, G12 and G13, okay.
Then they contain a set of you know,
items you EDABC,
could be the transactions
containing those items.
Each item actually is a set of visual
primitives from the items, okay.
But if you do frequent pattern mining,
you may find among those images.
You can get AB as frequent item set.
And actually this AB represents something
related to the wheels of the car.
So that, that's a reason those
frequent pattern mining can help
identify certain unique
features in different images.
So then the interesting thing could be,
because images
are spatial data then spatial
configuration does matter.
Then because sometimes those
transactions spatially are very close,
they may overlap each other.
Then they may have over counting problem.
For example, this AB actually in this
image, there's only one such AB pattern
but since the, based on your, your feature
image they are clustered together and
you get a two transactions, you actually
count AB twice in this picture, okay.
So there, there's a over counting problem.
Another problem encountering this visual
pattern discovery, is uncertainty problem.
Because you may have eh,
some like those wheels
can be partially eh,
occluded by other objects or
mixed with other objects,
you may have lots of noise, okay.
Some feature you may
not be able to detect.
Another is visual synonym and polysemy
problem that essentially is sometimes the,
the, the same feature after it
made wrapped in different objects.
Or one object can be wrapped in
different kinds of feature sets.
So, we need to revise our
frequent pattern discovery
algorithm to handle this
over counting problem,
uncertainty problem,
synonym and polysemy problems.
Actually there are interesting studies
in comparable vision community.
They develop some interesting visual
pattern discovery matters for
image and video data.
So if you are interest in this,
you, I would recommended you study
those research papers to gain your
knowledge to a certain depths.
