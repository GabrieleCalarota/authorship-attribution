In this new lecture, we are going to
introduce one important application
of pattern mining,
called pattern-based classification.
We know classification is
a very useful concept.
So we are going to introduce to you
the basic concepts of classification for
someone who may not know much
about classification, and
then we are going to introduce what is
concept of pattern-based classification?
In particular, we are going to discuss
three kinds of methods associated
with classification, discriminative
pattern-based classification,
and also the direct mining
of discriminative patterns.
So, we first discuss the basic
concepts of classification.
Actually, classification, some people
also call this supervised learning.
The general idea is,
given a set of training instances,
the training instance mea,
means some particular datasets that
the experts will give you
the class labels, for example say,
this one is positive, this one is
negative this is typical for like a, for
medical diagnosis, you find certain
tissues, then you may check it.
The experts say this tissue is cancerous,
this one is benign, okay.
If we got these training instances,
we may try to wake up certain
classifications methods, okay.
Those procedures they,
they do the machine learning process,
they construct models, essentially
going through this learning process
we are going to get a set
of prediction models, and
once this model is validated we can
use it for the real classification.
That means we get a real test instances or
something you want to classify, okay.
Then you go through this prediction model.
The, these test instances would
be given particular label,
like positive or negative.
It's more like check whether
a tissue is cancerous or not, 'kay?
So, you probably can see this is very
useful machine learning and data mining
method is you take the training instances,
you construct the prediction model.
Once model is validated, it can very
useful to predict the new cases,
'kay, so
there are lots of classification methods
introduced in machinery, statistics,
and data mining researches.
For example, a popularly used method
called support vector machine is trying
to find the maximum margin so
you can, you can partition
the different cases in a,
in a clear way so
you can get a high quality, you know,
classifier constructed, okay?
Another method is decision tree,
essentially you try to find
different conditions which, you know,
can go through to different branches,
certain branches you can clearly
predict the class, class label.
The other you may get additional test
finally trying to get to confirm
what is the right you know, class this
particular instance should belong to.
Another interesting method
called network approach,
this is a simulation of
the human brain idea, you see,
we got the input layer, output layer,
and some hidden layers.
Then, going through this network
you'll adjust the different weights
based on the training data.
So finally you train this
network can be used for
good quality classification, 'kay.
Bayesian network is another
very popularly used method.
You, based on the Bayesian,
induction Bayesian inference,
you will be able to find the formulas,
which can be used as classifier
when the new case come,
you are going to go through this network,
and finally give the right class.
There are many, many more methods,
we are not going to introduce here, but
we will only focus on one method,
this pattern-based classification.
Actually classification has a lots
of interesting applications.
For example, for text classification, you
can use a set of text as training data and
people can give you some pretty
fine class labors, for example
whether the text belonged to literature
and art, or it belonged to education,
so you, based on this, you will be able to
construct using machine learning methods,
constructed a text classifier, or
we would say, text categorization system.
Then you get some new text by webpages or
documents.
You go through this classification system,
you are going to give
the right class label.
You can put those class
into right category.
For drug design it is very useful.
You take some training example to see
whether this drug is effective for
treating certain disease or it's not, and
once you construct good classification
model, then you get a new drug.
You may be able to test whether this drug,
likely will be effective or
ineffective for treating certain disease.
For face recognition in image,
computer vision and pattern recognition,
you may see you may get
certain inputs of the face,
and it goes through certain pattern
recognition system, [COUGH] you will
be able to construct a quality
face recognition system.
And once you get the new faces,
new images,
you will be able to recognize
a person to a certain extent.
Another popular application
could be spam detection.
It means you'll get emails, the spam
detector built in some web server,
based on the model constructed your,
your email coming through they will
read the email, and with certain good
accuracy to say this is not a spam,
it should be put in the mailbox.
Or this is definitely a spam, you
should put it in the the junk mails, or
something not quite sure,
you may put some warning sign,
or ask expert to do certain,
further evaluation, okay?
From here, you probably can see, there are
so many applications of classification,
so the important thing is whether we can
build up very powerful classification
methods on both efficiency and
effectiveness and scalability.
So, we're going to study
one classification method,
which is pattern-based
classification in this lecture.
