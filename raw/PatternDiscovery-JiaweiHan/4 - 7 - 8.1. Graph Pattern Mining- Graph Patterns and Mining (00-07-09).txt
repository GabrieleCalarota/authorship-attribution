Hi, in this lecture,
I'm going to introduce you another
interesting topic called
graph pattern mining.
So we're going to discuss a few topics,
including the concepts of graph
pattern and graph pattern mining.
We're going to introduce a few
graph pattern mining methods,
including apriori-based graph
pattern mining methods,
pattern growth graph pattern
mining method called gSpan.
Then we will introduce how to mine
closed graph patterns, like CloseGraph.
We will introduce one interesting
applications of graph pattern mining,
graph indexing.
Finally, we are going
to discuss how to mine
large structural patterns in
a single massive network.
We will first introduce graph pattern and
graph pattern mining concepts.
What is graph pattern?
Actually, we can assume you
have a large set of graphs.
For example, you have graph G sub
1 to G sub n in the data sets,
you, you can think these are many,
many chemical compounds.
The support of graph data sets
g is defined in this way.
This g is a small subgraph, so
how many such graphs
contain this subgraph g?
And this G, every such G bigger
graphs actually is in your dataset.
That means, within this dataset,
how many graphs containing this graph g,
then the support of g essentially
is defined by the graph
containing the subgraph g,
how many of them divided
by the whole number of
graphs in your datasets.
That's a support.
Very similar to how many
transactions containing these items.
If we say a subgraph g is frequent if g's
support is greater than minimum
threshold min support, okay.
That's also very,
very similar to item set definition and
frequent to pattern,
sequential pattern definition as well.
Let's look at some examples.
Suppose we get a bunch
of chemical structures.
I just show you there three
chemical compound structures.
Then you may find some
frequent subgraph patterns.
For example, you may find this nitrogen
and oxygen based on their types of links.
You will find some kind of interesting
chemical compound structures.
Like you find in two set
structural one is in B, y is in C.
So you find this.
You will say this is
a subgraph whose support is 2.
Actually, you can find even a bigger one.
For example, you can find the two
nitrogen from a ring structure,
then linked to oxygen.
So you can see these two nitrogen
form a ring structure link to oxygen,
you'll find two as well.
So what you can see is,
this two is actually a super graph of one.
But the support you find two out of three,
that's why you can claim
the support is 67%.
Besides many, many small subgraphs,
you try to find their
common subgraph structures.
And we may sometimes we may
encounter big networks,
like a social network or, or a web.
You get a single large graph or network.
You may want find frequent subgraph
structures inside of this network.
So this another problem we are going
to discuss in this lecture as well.
Then graph pattern mining
has lots of applications.
For example, in bioinformatics,
we see gene networks,
protein networks, metabolic pathways.
There are lots of such things you may
find their frequent substructures.
In chemical informatics,
you may find chemical compound structures.
In social networks, web communities,
tweets, you may find sub-networks
as a sub-community as well.
Even in cell phone networks, computer
networks, you may find lots of subgraphs.
And web, you have web graphs,
XML structures, semantic networks,
information networks.
You may find lots of
subgraph structures as well.
Even in software engineering, you may
think of the program execution flows,
or even you look at the static program,
you look at their programming structures.
You may find there are lots
of sub-graphs as well.
Plus, the graph classification,
clustering, graph compression,
graph comparison, or graph correlation
analysis, the graph pattern mining
we'll form building blocks for
those more complicated graph mining tasks.
Finally, I should mention, even for
applications, for example,
graph search, graphs in lab research,
or graph search using indexing.
We may use graphs pattern mining to
build efficient indexing structures,
and perform more effective and
efficient graph similarity search.
Graph pattern mining has been studied in
data mining community for quite a while.
Okay.
There are lots of algorithms developed.
If we look at those algorithms, we can
classify the algorithms in different ways.
For example,
whether this method is apriori based or
pattern growth based method.
For example,
FSG is a typical apriori based method, and
gSpan is an interesting
pattern growth method.
Then we can look at search order.
We want to do mining by breadth-first
search versus depth-first search.
And we can see how the method
eliminates subgraphs.
You can do passive elimination,
that means you first find something
then you try to get rid of them.
Or you can do active elimination,
that means before they generate,
you try to eliminate them.
And how to do support calculation.
For example, whether you want
to store those embeddings, like,
store some subgraphs or trees or
something, store some embeddings.
Or you want to do online
dynamic computation.
And even for ordering of the pattern
discovery, whether you want first mine,
frequent paths, then mine frequent
subtrees, then you mine graphs.
Whether they are more efficient,
that's also in consideration in
the algorithm's development.
