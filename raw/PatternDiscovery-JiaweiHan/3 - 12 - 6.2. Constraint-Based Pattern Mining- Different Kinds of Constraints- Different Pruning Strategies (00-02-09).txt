[SOUND] For
constraint based pattern mining,
the first important thing we
should know is different kinds
of constraints will lead to
different pruning strategies.
In particular, we can partition
constraints into two categories.
One, we call pattern space
pruning constraints.
Another record,
data space pruning constraints.
For pattern space pruning constraints,
we're going to study anti-monotonic
constraints, monotonic constraints,
succinct constraints and
convertible constraints.
What is anti-monotonic constraints?
That means if the constraint
c is violated,
this further processing can be terminated.
That means it's pattern will
not need to be examined again.
Then for monotonic constraints,
if these constraints are satisfied,
there is no need to check c again
in the subsequent mining process.
What is succinct constraints?
That is the constraint can be directly
enforced manipulating the data.
What is convertible constraints?
That means the constraints can
be converted to monotonic or
anti-monotonic, if we process
the item in certain order.
Then for data space constraints,
we are going to di,
discuss data succinct constraints and
data anti-monotonic constraints.
Data succinct is constraints
is data space can be pruned in
the initial pattern mining process.
And data anti-monotonic constraints means,
if the transaction of the current
processing that this transaction
cannot satisfy, this constraint t.
Then this transaction can be pruned
to reduce the data processing effort.
In the subsequent discussion, we're
going to discuss all these constrains,
one by one.
