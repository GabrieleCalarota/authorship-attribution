Hi, in this lecture we're
going to introduce you
another interesting direction called
Constraint-Based Patter Mining.
So, what is constraint-based
pattern mining?
You see centuries,
we do pattern mining but
we want to push various kinds of
constraints into the mining process.
Why we're going to study
constraint-based mining?
Because, we can see different
kinds of constraints were lead
to different pruning strategies.
In this lecture, we are going to
discuss a few typical constraints,
including Constraint-Based Mining
with Pattern Anti-Monotonicity.
Constrained-Based Mining with Pattern
Monotonicity or Constraint-Based Mining
with Data Anti-Monotonicity,
and also we are going to study
Constraint-Based Mining with Succinct
Constraints, with Convertible Constraint.
Finally, we're going to discuss how
to handle multiple constraints.
Let's look at the first issue.
Why Constraint-Based Mining?
In datamining, you may say, oh, you just
need minimum support, minimum confidence,
or minimum co-relations.I go into my
data sets, find all the patterns.
Finding all the patterns in the data sets.
Automatically, this sounds to
be attractive, but is not good.
Why it is not good?
Because you will get too many patterns,
but
the majority of those patterns may
not even be interesting to you.
Okay.
So, we suggest that pattern mining
should be an interactive process.
That means, user just to say,
what if you want a mine,
using a data mining query language,
or using graphics user interface.
Then the system will do
constraint-base mining.
That work give user maximal flexibility,
just to say,
what kind of constraints you want to have?
Then, the system will
behave like an optimizer,
if we explore such constraints for
efficient mining,
that means we want to push
constraints as deeply, as possible.
This is a similar to database
query processing you
want to push query constants,
deeply into the query processing process.
But now we want to push constraints
into the mining process.
Then we look at it, in general,
what kind of constraints we may have?
Suppose we want to design a data mining
query language, what we should have?
Okay.
One is knowledge type constraints.
That means.
What kind of knowledge you want to mine?
You want to mine classification, or
association, or clustering, or outliers?
Another thing is, you want to specify,
what kind of data you want to mine?
That means, in a very large database,
you may say,
I only want to mine the products all
together in New York stores this year.
So, you, you have,
the particular location, particular time,
particular things you want to study.
Then, you may also specify dimensions and
levels, as constraints.
For example, you can say,
I want to find those different patterns in
relevance to region, price, brand,
customer category essentially is
almost you came to multidimensional
multilevel mining.
Then another important thing is you
want to specify pattern constraints, or
rule constraints.
For example, you want to say,
I want to find small sales.
For example, those items on sale
with a price less than $10.
But if we want to see,
how they can trigger bigger sales?
That means, the total sum of your shopping
basket will be greater than $200.
Then we also can specify some
interestingness constraints, like your
set of constraints for minimum support,
minimum confidence, minimum correlation.
See whether those things can be
pushed deep into your mining process.
So in general,
you can specify a meta-rule like this.
You can say, I have two predicates.
I want to find, what are the two
predicates that may trigger X to buy iPad?
Then the resulting mined rule can
be if X's age is within 15 to 25,
if X is a student,
likely X is going to buy iPad.
So that could be an interesting one.
So in general, you can specify meta rules.
On the left-hand side you
may have l predicates,
on the right-hand side
you have Q predicates.
So, our r predicates.
So you want to find methods
to mine such meta-rules.
And, what interesting one could be,
you first find frequent l plus r
predicates based on minimum support.
Then you can push constraints, if there's
any deeply into the mining process.
You can even push minimum confidence,
minimum correlation, other interesting is
measure, as deeply, as early, as possible.
So this is what we're going to sta,
study, how to push constraints
into the mining process?
Thank you.
