We have studied efficient methods
when mining frequent patterns and
also studied how to evaluate patterns and
rules nicely.
Now we are going to discuss how to extend
our scope to mine various kinds of
patterns and rules.
In this lecture, we're going to discuss
how do my multi-level association rules,
multi-dimensional association rules,
quantitative associations,
negative correlations, compressed and
redundancy-aware patterns and
long patterns.
We first discuss how to mine
multi-level association rules.
Multi-level association rules come
down to a very natural setting.
For example, to your boss,
if you say, now I find milk and
bread sold together, probably
everybody thinks this is common sense.
But if you find 2 percent with
the brand Dairyland, solve together
with Wonder wheat bread, probably,
it becomes something more interesting.
But if you see this Dairyland 2% milk is
actually sitting the hierarchy the top
level, it will be milk, then go down to 2%
milk, then go down to Dairyland 2% milk.
So it is interesting to my multi-level
association rule patterns.
Then, the interesting thing becomes how
to set a minimum support threshold.
One way is we set a uniform minimum
support threshold across all the levels.
But, there's one problem.
If you set it very high because
they naturally have lower support,
the low level patterns will not show up.
But if you set very low, the high level
will get too many interesting patterns,
because everything may show up.
So a reasonable way is set level reduced,
min-support.
That means, items at higher level
use higher level min-support,
like five percent.
When you go down to the lower level,
you may adopt lower level min-support,
like one percent.
To that extent, the skim milk will
show up at higher levels, you know,
peanuts or some other things might
show up if they are not interesting,
they are not frequent at all.
So then, the problem is,
if we set a multi-level minimum
support thresholds associated with
different levels, then how can
we use one scan and one shot,
we mine all the different levels?
The interesting thing could be we
can use shared market-level mining.
We can use the lowest
minimum support to let
the high level pass down to the low level.
But in the meantime, when we analyze
rules, when we analyze patterns,
we can fill out the high level rules
using higher level support thresholds.
So, another problem for
mining market-level association rules is
the redundancy because the rules
may have some hidden relationships.
For example, supposed 2% milk sold is
about 1/4 of total milk sold in gallons.
Then, if you see these two rules, 1 and 2,
the rule one says milk implies with bread
with the support 8%, confidence 70%.
But, rule two actually dropped down
a little down to from milk to 2% milk.
In the meantime, the support also
dropped down correspondingly, for
example from 8% to 2%.
In that case you probably can say and
rule two is
essentially redundant because we can
derive such things from rule one, okay.
That means, if the rule can be
derived from the higher level rules,
that lower level rules are redundant
we should remove them.
Another interesting thing is
different kinds of items inherently,
mainly different support thresholds.
For example, you go to Walmart.
You may see diamond watch or some
expensive things that are more valuable
but sold maybe less frequent, but milk and
bread probably is so very frequent.
So if we said, minimum support for
all kinds of items using the same minimum
support threshold, then the valuable
items may be even if you're out.
So, to that extent, it is necessary to
have customized min-support settings for
different kinds of items.
Okay.
Instead of taking each item try
to decide on a minimal support,
we can use group-based,
individualized minimal support.
For example, we can group diamond watch or
some expensive things set a low
minimal support, take milk and
bread those frequent set a higher
minimal support structure.
Then, the question becomes how to
mine such patterns efficiently.
Actually, if we take our previous study,
the scalable pattern mining methods
we can easily extend them by adding
different minimum support threshold.
I will now discuss the detail but
I think it could be a good exercise.
