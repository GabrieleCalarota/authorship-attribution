[SOUND] Now we come down to the very
last session of this lecture,
which is also the very last
session of this short course.
Looking forward, we have studied
a lot of pattern discovery masters,
some advanced concepts, some algorithms,
and a lot of applications.
We probably see there are lots of
interesting issue to be studied from
the first paper in this field,
like 1993, up to now, year 2015.
We introduce various kind
of research discoveries and
methods even last and here today.
'Kay.
So, this is still interesting research and
application domain in data mining.
So what we want to
emphasize is how we further
build up a new applications using
invisible pattern mining approach.
What is invisible pattern mining?
It's you build this pat, pattern mining
methods into various kinds of functions.
Okay.
Like a search function,
ranking function, recombination,
or other mat, mining functions.
Sometimes when people searches the web,
they may not know the implicitly
are using pattern mining results.
For example, we haven't seen,
we are studying classification.
There are so many classification methods,
but definitely frequent and
discriminative pattern mining
could be interesting contribution
to the different repositories of
the methods on classification.
Then we also studied the graph
indexing and a similarity search.
When you do indexing you do search,
you do various kind of retrieval,
you may use index constructed
by pattern analysis.
Then even for pattern mining,
we may first mine frequent patterns and
doing topic modeling,
then we can get a lots of, you know,
interesting primitives and
features for effective text mining.
When people doing software analysis, you
may use pattern mining method to discuss
lots of bugs or software specification,
regularities and
patterns which may help us
to find bugs in software.
For spatio, spatiotemporal,
trajectory, or moment pattern mining,
you may see, the frequent pattern
analysis can be an interesting
measure added to, you know,
to this set of weapons.
Then for image mining, multimedia data
mining like a video, audio analysis,
the pattern analysis could be an implicit
approach, you know, methods pure inside.
Even for a biological and chemical data
analysis, like analyze DNA sequences,
or biological graphs, lots of pattern
mining, may be used as primitives.
Even in clustering, for example,
we are going to study clustering in
data mining in this course, I'm going to
introduce you subspace clustering, which
actually frequent pattern mining will
become another interesting technique for
sub, subspace clustering.
Even people search the web, or
make recommendation of your products,
we'll study click streams
to enhance your search.
The pattern mining might play
an important role in this.
So you can see, pattern mining can be
applied in many, many different domains.
So, this invisible pattern
mining could be very important,
taking this as a pre-processing as some
component in your whole analysis package.
So we are facing very big data,
we're facing lots of challenges.
But the pattern mining surely is a tool.
So I hope by learning this course,
you will become part of research and
development force to push
pattern mining into new era
on most research applications.
Hopefully in the future,
in your work, you may find,
using the material you
learned from this course,
you are going to develop some
interesting functions and
push the technology into
application into the new frontier.
Thank you.
