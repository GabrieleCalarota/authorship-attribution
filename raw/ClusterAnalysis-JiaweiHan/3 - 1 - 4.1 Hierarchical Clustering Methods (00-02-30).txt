[SOUND] Hi, welcome to Lecture 4.
Hierarchical Clustering Methods.
In this lecture, we are going to discuss
the basic concepts and methods for
Hierarchical Clustering.
First, we'll discuss basic concepts
of Hierarchical Algorithms
including Agglomerative and
Divisive Clustering Algorithms.
Then we happen to discuss the Extensions
to Hierarchical Clustering.
Especially we were introduced BIRCH,
CURE, and CHAMELEON.
And then we were introduced
Probabilistic Hierarchical Clustering.
In the first section we'll introduce
basic concepts of
Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms.
So what is Hierarchical Clustering?
The Hierarchical Clustering means we
can start from either singleton cluster
iteratively merge them into
higher level clusters.
Okay.
Or we can start from one big
macro-cluster, iteratively split,
the bigger cluster into smaller ones.
Okay.
Then in this way we will
generate a clustering hierarchy.
Draw as a dendogram like this,
there is no requirement to
specify k the number of clusters.
And it is more deterministic, there,
there's no iterative refinement process.
Hierarchical clustering methods
contain two categories of algorithms.
In general, the hierarchical clustering
methods have two categories of algorithms.
One called Agglomerative.
It starts with singleton clusters,
continuously merge two
clusters at a time to build
bottom-up hierarchy of clusters.
The second category is
called Divisive methods.
Essentially it starts with a huge
a huge macro-cluster then split
them continuously into two groups.
It will generate a top-down
hierarchy of clusters.
