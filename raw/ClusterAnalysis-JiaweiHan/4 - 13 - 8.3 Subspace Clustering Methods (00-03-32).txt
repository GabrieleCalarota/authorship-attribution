[SOUND] In this session
we are going to first
give a general overview of
subspace clustering methods.
Why do we want to do subspace clustering,
just because many clusters may
exist only in some subspaces.
Subspace clustering at least try to find
clusters in all the subspaces from the low
subspace like only one d, to two d,
to three d, you know, as far as we can go.
Here we just show some pictures for
example the original data sets
visually you can see they are four
colors means four clusters.
However, they intermingle together.
If we project only on dimension a, we may
find it red and blue more were separated.
But the other color is somehow cluster,
mixed together.
But if we predict dimension
B will have different view,
dimension C will also have different view.
But if we predict dimension A and B,
in this two dimension space
we find the green and
red actually is way far
separated from the other parts.
So, if we can see project on different
dimensions you get different clusters.
Subspace Clustering Methods.
In general, we can get into axis-parallel
versus arbitrarily oriented subspaces.
Axis-parallel means there's
a subspace we're going to find,
we're going to search in
parallel with some axis.
Like in parallel with x-axis, y-axis,
z-axis, or their combination,
like x-y plane.
Arbitrarily oriented subspaces means
actually the real cluster could be,
you know, not correlated with x and
y, these kinds of plane,
but it, still that in some way,
you may be able to do some transformation.
Subspace search methods
essentially is just to pace on
axis-parallel subspaces,
then we try to search and find clusters.
We can use bottom-up approach,
then start from 1D,
then combine them into 2D, 3D spaces and
the, you know, higher one.
Top-down approach is, means you first
find it in a higher dimension space and
you try to finding the lower ones.
Then search and clustering in
arbitrarily oriented subspaces
essentially is we can do correlation
based clustering methods.
For example,
we do PCA based approaches where we can
introduce a little more detail later.
So that's what you may find if you
transform into certain orientation.
You may reduce the dimensions.
You may do finalized clusters.
We will also study bi-clustering methods.
Especially bi-clustering methods
could be optimization-based or
enumeration-based methods.
