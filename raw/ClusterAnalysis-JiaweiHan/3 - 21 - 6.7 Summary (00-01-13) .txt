In summary,
in this lecture we studied Probabilistic
Model-Based Clustering Methods.
We introduced the basic concepts of
probabilistic model based clustering.
We introduce a Mixed Model for
Cluster Analysis.
Especially we introduce
the Gaussian Mixture Model.
Then we discussed
the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for
univariate and multivariate.
Finally, we analyzed and
discussed different methods for
Mixture Model Methods.
So, finally I will give a list of
references if you want to go deeper
you may read those articles or books.
They contain some rich discussion of
Gaussian Mixture Model and EM Algorithms.
Thank you.
