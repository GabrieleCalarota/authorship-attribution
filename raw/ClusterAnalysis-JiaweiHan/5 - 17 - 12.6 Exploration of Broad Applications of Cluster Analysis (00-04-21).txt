[SOUND] Now we come down to
the final session of this lecture,
also the final session of
this Cluster Analysis course.
We were just touch a letter on Exploration
of Broad Applications of Cluster Analysis.
We know Cluster Analysis has
very broad applications.
Here I just give you a few,
just outlining in a very brief way.
For example, we see there lots of
studies on Customer Segmentation and
Collaborative Filtering using
cluster analysis techniques.
That means we can cluster customers
based on their similarities of their
profiles and shopping behaviors.
There are systems called recommendation
systems, the methods called collaborative
filtering based on clustering
of customer ratings of products.
Now text mining uses cluster
analysis quite a lot.
The typical topic modeling is
co-clustering of words and documents.
Actually, there are many recent studies
on how to do clustering, typing,
profiling and in-depth analysis of large
collections of text or web documents.
There are also lots of research work on
clustering of multimedia and social media.
For example, summarizing multimedia data,
like video data and also integrate
analysis of news and tweets.
There are more applications,
for example temporal and
sequential data analysis,
like a clustering Web
log click streams to find patterns of
users and reorganize Web page structures.
Or doing like a clustering biological
sequence data to construct
the biological models and biological
networks and discover anomalies.
In Social Network Analysis, cluster
analysis has been popularly used, for
example, clustering to find hidden social
communities called community detection.
Although, subsequent analysis for
anomaly detection,
classification, influence analysis and
link prediction.
There are many,
many more emerging applications.
They are very exciting.
They, they show a cluster analysis,
that's very important for
data mining and for
broad social applications.
There are many things waiting for
you to contribute.
We hope you will play
some very active role
in exploring broad applications
of cluster analysis.
Finally, we summarize this lecture in
this Advanced Topics and Applications.
Lecture, we discussed
Clustering Data Streams.
We introduced K-Median-Based Approach and
the CluStream Approach.
We also touch a little on
Advanced Themes of Cluster Analysis,
then we get into Application
of Cluster Analysis.
We introduce two interesting applications,
name disambiguation and
evolution of heterogeneous networks.
Then we touch a little broad
applications of cluster analysis where,
and we hoping you will contribute
more on cluster analysis and
its broad applications.
Finally, I'll just show you
a few reference book and
research papers we covered and
used in this lecture.
Hopefully, you will enjoy programming
assignment if you select to do so.
And you enjoy,
enjoy the remaining of this course.
Hopefully, you will get on more
data mining courses in Coursera and
you enjoy other Coursera courses.
Thank you and goodbye.
