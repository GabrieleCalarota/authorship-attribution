Hi, in this session,
I'm going to give you a brief overview
of user insights and clustering.
Usually, users may have some
interesting insights or views.
User may like to interact
with the clustering process
to influence the final
results of clustering.
One interesting one is visual insights,
because a picture is
worth a thousand words.
Human eyes are actually powerful,
high-speed processors because
they are also linked
with rich knowledge-base.
A human can provide a lot of
intuitive insights on whether this
clustering result is good or
something they desired.
It's not achieved based on
the current clustering result.
Okay.
There's usually users good on two,
one or two dimensional.
At most 3D they may,
they may be able to find clusters.
There, you know, algorithms for
example are HD-eyes.
How to visualize high
dimensional clusters.
The second one is
semi-supervised insights.
That means user may have certain insights
or intention on the clustering process.
They may like to pass their insights
through the system to influence
the results of the clustering.
For example,
user may provide some seeding.
That means you can provide
a number of labeled examples,
or some approximate representation
of the categories of interest.
Then you may like
the clustering process to
take your insight to do
some desired clustering.
The third one is the multi-view and
ensemble-based insights.
So called multi-view clustering is
different clustering may
generate different perspectives.
The multiple clustering, you know,
you can ensemble them together to
provide a more robust solution.
Finally, a very important one
is validation-based insights.
That means you may want to evaluate
the quality of the clusters generated
based on certain validation measures.
For example, you may use case studies or
you may provide specific measures,
or you may provide some
pre-existing labels.
All of these we are going to
discuss in detail in some chapter.
Finally, I will briefly summarize what
we have discussed in this lecture.
We introduced the concept of cluster and
a cluster analysis.
And we also introduced some
applications of cluster analysis.
We discussed the requirements and
the challenges of cluster analysis.
We provided a multi-dimensional
categorization of cluster analysis.
Especially we provided an overview
on typical clustering methodologies,
overview on clustering
different types of data, and
overview on user insights and clustering.
Finally, I provide a few
reference books and
especially the chapter by Charu Aggarwal.
An Introduction to
Clustering Analysis is a very
nice introduction of the general
ideas of clustering analysis.
Thank you.
