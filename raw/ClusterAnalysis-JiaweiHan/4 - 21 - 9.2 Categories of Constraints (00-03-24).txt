[SOUND] In this session,
we just introduced
different Categories of Constraints.
Constraints can be categorized based
on what kind of constrains it is, okay?
So the constraints can
be instances objects.
For example, you can specify how a pair or
set of instances,
those objects should be grouped
in the cluster analysis.
Usually the most typical ones are
must-link versus cannot-link constraints.
Must-link of x and
y means the objects x and
y must be group together into one
cluster in your cluster analysis.
For example, you can think these
two orange colored objects.
Once we say must-link that means in your
finer, in your cluster analysis when
you try to form clusters these two objects
should be in the same cluster, okay?
Constraints also can be
defined as variables.
For example,
you can say cannot link of x,y if
the distance of x,y is greater
than the predefined distance d.
For example,
you can say these two objects,
different colors, [INAUDIBLE] point
of orange color, other is blue color.
If we say these two objects cannot
be linked together simply says.
You can say these two objects
should be in different clusters but
once you specify these constraints.
You basically say, any kind of objects,
x and y, if their distance is
greater than d then cannot-link,
simplicity cannot be linked together.
The constraints on clusters
means you want to specify
requirements of the clusters.
That means finally when you form clusters,
what the cluster should satisfy?
Okay, for example, you may specify a
minimum number of objects in the cluster.
Simply says, this cluster must
contain at least say 100 optics.
The maximum time of a cluster
simply says these cluster,
the diamonds [INAUDIBLE]
cannot be over say 100.
The shape of cluster, for example the
cluster must be in the shape of convex.
The number of cluster, for example the k.
Also the constraints can
be on distance measures,
that means we can specify requirement,
the distance calculation.
The distance function,
distance calculation must
respect such a constraints.
For example, we can say eh,
when you are thinking about house,
households we use set up deliver centers.
You can say the cars must be driving on
the road when you calculate the distance.
And they must observe obstacles that
means they cannot cross rivers and
lakes using Euclidean distance.
They have the thinking about
a cross bridges or go around.
So these are the popular used,
the different categories of constraints.
