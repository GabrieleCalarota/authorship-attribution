In this session, we are going
to discuss proximity measure for
symmetric versus asymmetric
binary variables.
For binary variables, we usually reference
their occurrences using contingency table.
Okay.
Suppose we have two objects, i and j.
The number of times they
both appear could be q,
they both missing could be t places,
i appears and j does not,
but there are cases and
i does not appear and j appears s times.
Then for symmetric binary variables,
that means the chance they appear or
not appear actually
have equivalent chances or
proximate same chances.
We call these symmetric binary variables.
In that case, their distance like r and s.
These two cases, they are different.
So their distance measure is r
plus s divided by all the cases.
Okay.
For asymmetric binary, usually we assume,
the, they both appear the case is much
rarer than they both not appearing.
Okay.
So for these asymmetrical variables,
they are different, this r plus s.
But they, they both,
you know, not appearing.
In that case, actually it's t is,
is not so important.
The reason is for example, a medical test,
only the positive one
will attract attention.
Okay.
Then for the distance measure we,
we look at r plus s divided
by q plus r plus s.
That means all the cases
with t cases removed.
Okay.
Then for their similarity measure,
that means how many times they
are the same, actually is a q cases.
And for the q cases, we probably can
see that's the same denominator.
Okay.
Actually, Jaccard coefficient was somehow
rediscovered in
the Pattern Discovery field.
They call this one coherence.
Actually, this coherence definition,
if you really map one into this contingent
table, they have the same demi,
definition as Jaccard coefficient.
So then we look at the rare cases.
Suppose we have some medical tests.
Then we have Jack, Mary and
Jim three cases, three people.
Their test, actually is represented in,
in, this table.
We can map them into contingency table.
Okay.
Since gender, the chance to be male and
female are roughly equivalent.
So this is a symmetric cases.
So for us, we are only
interested in asymmetric cases.
That means, the remaining
attributes becomes more important,
then we try to examine
how they are different.
Suppose we say Y and P is positive case and
a value N and no other case would be zero.
Okay.
In that case, we look at our distance
measure for asymmetric attributes.
We can work out these contingents table
approach for Jack and Mary we proceed.
Jack and Mary they are the same parts
of the case like both have fever.
Those the tests one acts as positive.
There are two such cases.
Okay.
They have both negative,
like a cough test two and test four.
Actually, they, there are three cases,
they are both negative.
But they do have one case,
they are different.
Okay.
So the similarity we can workout
contingency table for Jack and
Jim, Jim and Mary.
In this case,
we can calculate their difference, but
we can easily see Jack and
Mary actually are most similar.
Jim and Mary are most different.
We may conclude that Jack and Mary may
have similar disease in this case.
Okay.
