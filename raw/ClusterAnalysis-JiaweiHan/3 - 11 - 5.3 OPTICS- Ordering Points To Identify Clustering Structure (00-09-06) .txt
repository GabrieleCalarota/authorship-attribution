[SOUND] In this session, we are going to
introduce Optics: Ordering Points
to Identify Clustering Structures.
Actually, this method is
an extension of DBSCAN by almost
the same research group still
led by Hans-Peter Kriegel.
Published in six March 1999.
This method produces a special
clustering ordering of data points,
with respect to density
based clustering structure.
That means you try to find a cluster
ordering the very dense cluster,
actually they are nested within
the last dense clustering structures.
So that means contains information
equivalent to density based clustering,
but it's corresponding to a broad
range of parameter settings, that may
overcome the sensitivity to
the parameter setting problem of DBSCAN.
It is good for both automatic and
interactive clustering analysis,
because it finds intrinsic
clustering structure.
The general idea is,
we give a fixed minimum number of points,
then the density-based clusters
,with respect to a higher density,
that means a lower epsilon
are completely contained in clusters
with respect to a lower density.
Simply it says, the higher
density if they pass a threshold,
they definitely,
pass a lower density's threshold.
So you will find a massive structure,
because a very dense one nested
within the less dense clusters.
That means the higher density
points should be processed first.
You can find the high
density clusters first.
Then you can store such a clustering
ordering using two pieces of information,
one called core distance,
another called reachability distance.
So we'll see how this is defined.
The first,
how the core distance is defined.
Okay, the core distance of a point
p is the the small epsilon,
such that, that p's epsilon threshold at
least minimum number of points objects.
Suppose we say the minimum
number of points is five.
In this case, if you look at the p,
p will become a core,
if you set the epsilon prime
to be three millimeters.
Then it will reach five points
because you can see p and
its neighborhood, total number of
points adding together is five already.
So three millimeters,
it is a good core distance.
That means,
if we wanted to find a core distance with
respect to epsilon and
minimum number of points of p, then,
we will say, if p's epsilon neighborhood
cardinality is smaller than minimum
number of points, then p is undefined.
Otherwise, p is the minimum
points distance.
That means whenever it reaches
the minimum number of points,
that radius actually is the core distance.
Then we can define reachability
distance of object p from object q,
is the minimum radius value that
makes p density reachable from q.
Simply says,
if you want to reach q you can see
how what is the minimum radius.
And we can make this number of
points as five, we can keep rolling,
we can reach the q.
Then p and q reachability
distance is Is this value, okay?
If we want to define reachability
distance using ipsu and
minimum number of points to reach p,
if q is not a core object,
that means that you actually you
cannot reach no matter what ipsu and
minimum number of points,
then we say this is undefined.
Otherwise, you just look at
the core distance and the,
the real distance between q and p.
Pick their maximum value.
Then, if we use index, suppose k is number
of dimensions, n is number of points,
then the computational complexity is
O(N logN) it is reasonably efficient.
So, this method will generate
a interesting clustering structure,
which can be described
in this curve structure.
Essentially is, if,
if they are density-reachable,
their reachability distance
actually is pretty low.
But once you try to go
out of this cluster,
then the reachability
distance will become higher.
So if it's very far away you
try to get it, it is undefined.
So you basically,
you write the point like this.
So the valley corresponding to
the clusters and because you have a nested
structure, so that you basically can
consider this whole thing as one cluster,
but these are the nested clusters,
they can be hierarchically nested.
Because this one cluster and
if you were nested, is three sub-clusters.
So you can probably see you have clusters
within clusters, once you do the mapping
you still find the, the cluster instructor
with different parameter settings.
Actually they are not so
sensitive to the number of clusters,
because you still see one,
two, three, four.
You may see one, two, three,
four as a major cluster,
but they have some minor clusters
you still will be able to find.
Here, like this is
actually a tennis court,
the tennis match if we can see
these other fields or trees, and
this is the tennis court, these are the
players, but with this if you tried to
use the density based clustering, you will
be able to find several different things.
You will find a very nice hierarchical
clustering structure using
the optics method.
