[SOUND] Welcome to lecture 7,
Methods for Clustering Validation.
We have been working on clustering
measures, but a very important thing
is how to evaluate whether the clustering
there is good, is stable or is valid.
So we want to introduce the basic
concepts of clustering renovation,
then we will study how to
evaluate clustering quality.
Especially we will introduce external
measure, internal measures and
the relative measures.
For external measures we are going to
introduce matching-based measures,
entropy-based measures,
and pairwise measures.
We will also study clustering
stability and clustering tendency.
We first introduce some basic
concepts of clustering validation.
We know clustering is unsupervised method.
In a sense,
we do not have any expert to judge whether
this clustering is good,
what should be clustered.
So it is important to
evaluate clustering quality
That means evaluating
the goodness of the clustering.
Also we want evaluate
clustering stability.
That means to understand the sensitivity
of the clustering results
to various algorithm parameters.
For example, the number of clusters.
That means what number of clusters is
really good based on our evaluation.
The third one is clustering tendency.
That means whether it's
suitable to do clustering.
That means whether the data has
inherent to grouping structure
then we should in for
some kind of clustering to discover it
