We first introduced STING, the first grid
based maser which is statistic
information in the grid structure.
This maser called statistic
information grid approach.
Essentially you can think the grid
structure look like this.
You got a multiple layers.
That means the spatial areas
divide into rectangular cells
at the different levels of resolution.
Then these cells actually
form a tree structure.
That means each cell at a higher layer,
each cell actually store a summary
of the lower level set of cells.
That means a cell at the higher level
contains a number of smaller cells
of the next lower level.
To that extent,
it form a hierarchical tree structure.
What the cell will store.
The statistic information of
each cell actually calculate and
store beforehand, and
then can be used to answer queries.
That means you can calculate
the statistic information and
its corresponding set of sales and
the lower layer.
Then the parameter of the higher level
cells, the calculation contains a bunch of
statistical information including number
of points in the cell which is a count.
Okay.
Then their mean, their standard deviation,
the minimum value, the maximum value,
and also the type of distributions.
For example, whether these points
form a normal distribution, or
a uniform distribution, or
other kinds of distributions.
So if we store these cell
in the hierarchical way,
to process a region query,
including finding clusters,
we can start at the root
of this grid structure, and
proceed to the next lower level
using this STING indexing structure.
That means we can calculate the likelihood
a cell is relevant to the query
at some confidence level using the
statistic information stored in the cell.
Once we are confident,
we need to go down only children
at the likely relevant cells
are recursively explored.
So it is quite localized,
it could be quite efficient.
We can repeat this process until
the bottom layer is reached.
The advantages,
this structure is query-independent and
the process can be easily paralyzed and
we can do incremental update as well.
Also, the efficiency is very good.
That means the complexity
is quite low because if
the K is number of grid
cells at the lowest level.
Then the complexity is big O linear to K,
while K is much less than N,
the number of data points.
However, it's disadvantageous,
because you form a great structure
you may lose a lot of details.
The probabilistic nature of
the higher labor may imply
a loss of accuracy in the lower level for
query processing.
