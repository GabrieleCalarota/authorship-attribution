[SOUND] In this session, we will briefly
introduce the approaches for
graph clustering.
There are many methods proposed for graph
clustering, we will just introduce a few.
One approach called partition
with geometric information.
For example, one algorithm called
Geometric Bisection algorithm.
The general idea is you will partition
the graphs according to their meshes.
However, in many real graphs,
especially social networks and
many other abstract graphs,
such geometric information
is not available,
is not really quite related.
So that algorithm cannot be applied.
Then there are some other methods called
graph growing and a greedy algorithm.
The general philosophy is try to
start from the smaller graph and
it grow into the bigger one.
One interesting algorithm in this
bigger category called Kernigham and
Lin algorithm, we call K/L,
which was proposed in 1970.
The general philosophy is
we take a random partition,
the graphing to the required partition,
then we can apply K/L algorithm to it.
This K/L algorithm means at
each iteration we try to swap
the pairs of vertices if
we can increase the gain.
So, essentially if we can keep swapping
pairs of vertices to maximize the gain,
then we can get the desired partition.
Then the third group of algorithms called
agglomerative and divisive clustering.
This is similar to the algorithm
we studied in the hierarchical
clustering method.
One representative one was proposed
by Mark Newman in 2004, the general
idea is merge small communities if
it increases the graph's modularity.
Okay.
And he proposed one algorithm
called fast modularity algorithm.
Then the first category is
using spectral clustering.
This one is quite popular
clustering method introduced and
its popularity keeps increasing.
So we will cover the spectral clustering
in detail in the next session.
[COUGH] Then the fifth category
called Markov clustering.
The general idea is we have
transition probability matrix,
then we'll iteratively apply expand and
inflate these two steps on
transition probability matrix.
After that,
we are going to prune away the smaller
values in each column and
renormalize this matrix.
Then next iteration, we'll do this again.
Due to limited time, we will in
all these graph clustering methods
we'll introduce the most popular one.
Spectral clustering in the next session.
