Hi, in this session we are going
to discuss the first group of
external measures,
called matching-based measures.
For matching-based measures, we will first
introduce purity versus maximum matching.
We still use similar notation.
Suppose we have ground truths
we get three categories.
T1 actually marks the brown points,
T2 marks the green points,
T3 marks the black points.
These are the ground truths.
Then the clustering we finally
got is cluster C sub 1,
actually is marked as the,
the ellipse of the orange color, okay.
C2 mark as surrounded by the red color.
And C3 is surrounded by the black color.
So what is the purity?
Actually quantifies the extent
of that cluster C sub
I contains the points only from
one ground truth partition.
Suppose we have r clusters final.
So for purity sub i, actually is,
you first count how many
points in this cluster.
Then you try to see the maximum
number of the ground truths here.
The maximum number of ground truths,
actually the black points.
You will see the max number is one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven.
So you get this one seven but
the total number is nine so
you get a purity of seven over nine.
Then what is the total purity
of the whole clustering C?
Essentially this total
purity is each ones purity.
Suppose we have R cluster.
Each one's purity gets their
corresponding proportion.
So you add them together,
so that's the total purity.
Or we can transform this one
very easily into this one, okay.
Of course, the perfect clustering is
in the case when the purity's one.
That means you, everything's very pure.
You add them together, it's one.
And the number of clusters ob,
obtained is the same as the number
of groups in the ground truth.
Then we look at these two tables, okay?
Let's first look at the green table.
The green table,
the purity one, that means the first
cluster, you get a maximum 30.
So the purity is 30 over
the total number of points, is 50.
So you get 30 over 50.
Purity 2 obviously you get 20 over 25 and
purity 3 is 25 over 25 is really 1.
Then the total purity for the whole class
range, is according to this formula,
we get a maximum y as 30 plus 20 plus 25
over the total number points you get 0.75.
Interestingly, if you look at
the orange table, orange colored table,
you will get exact number the same thing
is 30 over 50, 20 over 25, 25 over 25,
then finally get that purity
is exactly the same formula.
But, you may find one undesirable
thing for this orange color table.
Because as you see the ground truth,
T2 total gets 50.
The actual partition into two clusters,
C1 and
C2 That means both C1 and C2 would say,
we belong to ground truth T2.
But on the green table, you probably
can see it's different, because C1
more pair with T3, and
C2 more pair with T2.
So that motivates people
propose maximum match.
That means one cluster can
only match to one partition.
If we have this rule,
then we have to find a pairwise match.
That means when we look at this,
we look at the weight, we will allow these
element only belongs to one cluster.
The ij and ij.
The ij must be the exact same.
Then if this element belongs to M,
then it only belongs to one.
So then we need to look at what
is the maximum weight match.
The maximum weight match simply
says you look at the whole group.
And then you look at the all over points.
You try to find the final matching
together should be maximized.
For example, if you look at a green one,
the max matching is 30 pertaining to t3,
t2 pairwise with C2, P1 pairwise with C3.
That's why green's maximum
matching is equal to purity 0.75.
However, for
this orange color table you pertain C is,
if you sin T2 to C1 then
you can assign T2 to
C2 then you have to assign T3 to C2 then
finally you get this matching 0.6.
However, if you assign T3 to C1, T2 to C2,
T1 to C3 you'll get matching at 0.65.
To that extent,
this assignment is better because
the max matching the value is bigger.
So that's the reason for the max matching,
you do have restriction,
you have the pairwise assignment.
Then another popular use matching-based
measure called F-measure.
F-measure has been very popular
used in information retrieval.
F-measure essentially is
computed by precision and recall.
Let's look at how the precision
is defined, okay.
The precision is defined is for this
particular matching what you want to see
is for
precision C sub I what you want find
that is what's a maximum one
matching this particular cluster.
Then divide by the number of, the total
number of points in this cluster.
So in that sense, you're position
actually is the same as purity.
That means if you get a fraction of C sub
I from the majority partition of C sub J.
Then the J's partition
contains the maximum number
of points from C sub I
then you get this formula.
For this formula you get this,
the precision and the purity.
Actually, this point is the same.
You get 30 over 50,
20 over 25 and 25 over 25.
'Kay?
That's the precision.
What about recall?
Recall actually is the fraction
of the points in the partition
shared in common with cluster C sub i.
Simply says, if you assign T3 to C1,
what you want to see is you get 30, but
T3 actually got 35 ground truth,
you only capture 30.
That means your recall is 30 over 35.
That's exactly you probably
can see the formula.
Similarly for
the second partition if this time
branch is T2 to C2 what you
can see is you only get
a 20 over 40 so
their recall is 20 over 40.
Similarly for, for the third one,
when you assign the ground truth
of T1 to C3, the 25 over 25.
That means that the fraction
of the point in this partition
share in common with the cluster C sub i.
Then you get this recall.
Then what about F-measure?
F-measure actually is a harmonic
means of precision and recall.
So, F-measure for cluster C sub i is
the harmonic means of precision sub i,
and recall sub i.
If you transform the formula,
it will become like this one.
Then for F-measure for
the whole clustering.
What you need is, you just need to
average all the clusters, the F-measure.
That means, suppose you get r clusters,
then you get F-measure from one to r.
You add them together divided by r, okay.
So for this green table
what you can see is why you
get F1 is because you
got 2 times 30 divided
by total is these two
add together you get 85.
Then for F2 you get 2 times 20
divided by these two adding together.
The F3, of course, is 1,
no matter what you calculated.
Then, your average of these 3,
you get F-measure this number.
