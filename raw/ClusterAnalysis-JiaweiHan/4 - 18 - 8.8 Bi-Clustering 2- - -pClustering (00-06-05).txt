In this session,
we are going to introduce another
interesting bi-clustering method,
called delta-pClustering.
We just studied delta bi-clustering,
Cheng and Church's approach.
They published their
paper in ISMB year 2000.
Their approach is
an optimization-based approach.
Essentially is you first try to chop
anything with quite a big residue,
you try to find a small one, actually
chop quite many in the deletion phase.
Then you try to add, one by one,
rows and columns to add them
back to still maintain their XMO,
they're a bi-cluster.
Okay.
That's quite costly.
So an efficient algorithm called
delta-pClusters is exploring
pattern similarity using enumeration
approach done by Hijin Wang's group,
they published in year
2002 SIGMOD conference.
That measure of the general philosophy is,
we get submatrix I times J
if we want to define they are perfect
coherent, we just look at I1J1,
I2J1, these cell is difference,
then look at I1J2, I2J2.
These two cells,
they're rather different, okay?
So, that means for any two by two matrix,
we can define p-score as follows.
You get this, smallest two by two matrix,
you want see they
are two rows, difference different
columns then look at their difference.
If their difference is the absolute value,
it's very small.
Simply says the p-score is pretty small.
That means they are almost
perfect coherent.
Okay, then we can define bigger
one like I times J submatrix.
Okay.
So, they start a pCluster or we can say
they're a pattern-based to close, cluster.
Essentially if you look at it,
every two by two submatrix
they are p-score if it's
within their threshold.
This delta is a user specified tolerance
threshold, tolerance of the noise.
Then this p-score controls
the noise on every sub-element,
submatrix of the delta bi-cluster,
which is actually a little more rigorous
comparing to the delta bi-clustering
algorithm they use mean square residue.
They capture the, the average noise.
This one is captured every 2 by
2 matrix they are submatrix or
every submatrix, they are noise.
Then this delta-pCluster has
a nice monotonicity behavior.
That means,
you look at at the I times J submatrix.
Actually, every,
their submatrix, that means for
every x times y, x and y greater than 2.
They are 2 by 2, 3 by 3,
3 by 4, all of these submatrix.
They are also delta bi-cluster.
So it's quite nice we
have the monotonicity.
With this monotonicity, we can use,
like, a average based algorithm.
Like in pattern discovery, we can find it.
However, we only want find the maximal y.
That means if no more rows and
columns can be added to still make
it a delta bi-cluster,
then we say this one is a maximal.
Our algorithm only need to compute
the maximal delta-pClusters.
Actually, there are some
additional advantages.
One advantage is, it contains no outlier.
Because the original delta
bi-cluster algorithm is
taking the averaging of these ratios.
But the outreach actually it still,
it may contain the outliers just
because you get a quite big and
quite small value once the average,
they still maintain value in the middle.
So they may still, within the
delta-threshold, so it may not be so nice.
Another interesting thing is if we look
at scaling pattern like this pattern,
the down part of the right of this corner,
this pattern.
We per see, if we take,
for this scaling pattern,
if we take a logarithmic on this value,
because scaling means,
if you take the ratio,
the ratio should be less than delta.
But, if you take a log, the original
division becomes the difference.
So it takes exact p-score form,
the only difference is all of
these values just take their log.
Okay?
Then, this actually, you do not need a new
algorithm, you also can find the scaling
patterns, which is quite nice.
A year later Jian Pei working together
with Haixun Wang, they develop another
algorithm called MaPle to further
improve the mining efficiency,
based on a pattern-based approach,
like f p growth like method.
But they actually just need to
find a frequent closed itemsets.
That method is based on the ca,
condition of the combination you
can find a maximal subset of genes.
They're still delta bi-cluster.
Then you, based on this idea, you can
further improve the processing efficiency.
