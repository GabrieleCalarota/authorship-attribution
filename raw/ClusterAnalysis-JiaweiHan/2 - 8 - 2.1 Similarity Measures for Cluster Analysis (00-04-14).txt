[SOUND] All right, welcome to lecture two,
Similarity Measures for Cluster Analysis.
In this lecture, we're going to introduce
the basic concepts of similarity measures,
especially we were focused on
measuring similarity between objects.
Were we introduce Minkowski Distance for
measuring numerical data.
Introduce proximity measures for symmetric
versus asymmetric binary variables.
We will discuss the distance measure
between categorical attributes,
ordinal attributes and mixed types.
We will introduce proximity measure
between two vectors, cosine similarity.
First, we are going to introduce
correlation measures between two vectors
called covariance and
correlation coefficient.
So we first get into session one.
Basic concepts means how to measure
similarity between objects.
Since clustering is
an unsupervised learning process.
So we do not have predefined labors
to judge whether it's right or wrong.
So how can we judge
a clustering process is good?
That means whether it produce
high quality clusters.
Usually we need two methods,
one called high intra-class similarity and
the other called low
inter-class similarity.
What is high intra-class similarity?
That means you want to see
the objects within the same cluster,
they are rather similar,
they are cohesive.
You also want to see
inter-class similarity is low,
in the sense you want to see
the objects in different clusters
they are rather de-similar or
they are distinctive.
So, to measure this we need
some separate quality function
to measure how good a cluster is.
However, it is hard to define
what is similar enough or
good enough but the answer usually
could be quite subjective.
Thus the reason we want to look at
different similarity measures or
the similarity functions for different
applications but they are critical for
cluster analysis.
For terminologies,
people actually want to distinguish
quite interesting similar things
called similarity measure,
dissimilarity measure or
proximity measure.
What is similarity measure or
similarity function?
Usually similarity function
is a real value function
to quantify the similarity
between two objects.
Usually the higher value
It means more similar,
so the value range is 0 to 1.
0 means there is no similarity,
1 means they are completely similar or
they are identical.
Then similar to similarity,
many people want to use dissimilarity or
distance measure.
Distance measure or distance function
is a numerical measure to measure how
different these two objects are.
To some extent, the dissimilarity
is inverse of similarity,
that means the lower or
the shorter the distance, the more alike.
The minimum dissimilarity is zero means
they are completely similar or identical.
The value range could be either 0 to 1 or
0 to infinity based on the definition.
Another term called proximity,
this is usually referred to as
either similarity or dissimilarity.
