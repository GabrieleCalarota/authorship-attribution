[SOUND] In this session,
we're going to introduce graphs and
networks, their basic concepts and
their representations.
So what is a network or graph?
A network or
graph usually treated like synonyms.
A, a graph G is written by
a set of vertices, V, or
is also called nodes for
some literature, and
a set of edges E, or
some people will call it a set of links.
E, actually it's a subset of
V cross product with V and
n is the number of vertices
also called order of G,
and it's the number of edges
also called the size of G.
The multi-edge means if
there exist more than one
edge linking between the two vertices,
for example one, two,
if there were more than one edge we
call this is a multi-edge graph.
Okay.
Also,
the loop means edge connected
a vertex to itself.
Usually we call this as a self loop.
For example, if you get a Y, you get
another edge also connected to Y directly.
That's a self loop.
For simple network we will not
consider self edges or multi-edges.
Then, if we want to represent this simple
network, we rep it as adjacency matrix.
If i and j is one simply says there is
a edge connecting between vertex i and j.
'Kay.
Then, otherwise it's a zero.
Directed graph simply says
the edge may have directions,
like tail, point to head.
The, in that case, if the adjacency
matrix A sub i, j equals one,
means there's an edge from j to i.
It's directed.
Otherwise this is zero if there
is no such directed edge.
'Kay.
Sometimes the graph may not just a one or
a zero,
they may have certain
weights with every edge.
Weight w sub i j usually it's
a real number is associated with
each vertex each edge of v i, sub i j.
Then this graph is a weighted graph.
Then we see how to define
the vertex degrees.
Suppose we get a network G
consists of set of vertices.
And edges.
For Undirected Network essentially
there's no direction like this graph.
Then the degree of a vertex is defined as
how many edges from the other
ones going down here.
Going in and out is just
the same because it's undirected.
For example, okay.
We give it A.
Obviously the number of edges containing,
connected to A is four.
That's why the degree is four.
Similarly, the degree of H is two.
Then we look at directed network.
Directed network, the in-degree is how
many, edges pointing to this v sub i.
'Kay.
For example, if you look at the n degree
of A you probably can see there's three
edges pointing to A.
That's why n degree of A is three.
And n degree of b is two obviously.
Out-degree just reversed.
So look at how many edges
actually going out of it.
Okay?
From v sub i.
Okay, then if you look A's outgoing
edges you will find only one.
But at B's outgoing
edges you can find two.
So that's the basic concepts of vertex and
degrees.
