[SOUND] In this session we'll discuss
User Guided Meta-Path Selection for
Clustering in Heterogeneous Networks.
Why we want user guidance in clustering?
Simply says different users may
like to get different clusters for
different applications.
For example,
we may want to cluster authors based
on their connections in the network.
Suppose we get eight authors and
four of them came from UIUC.
The other four are from MSR,
Microsoft Research.
Then we may have four different
authors published papers in KDD.
The other four published papers in SIGMOD.
Then how can we cluster
this eight authors?
It really depends on what do you want.
For example, if you follow the meta-path
AOA, that means common organizations,
you will group 1,2,3,4 into one
cluster 5,6,7,8 as another.
However, if you say the venue is more
important, the publication venues.
You will group differently,
you will get a 1,3,5,7 or
the KDD authors group in one cluster.
2, 4, 6,
8 they will be in another cluster.
Okay, however,
you say both of them are important.
You probably will get 1, 3 as one
cluster because they are from UIUC,
they published in KDD.
So that's rather different.
However, which meta-path we should choose
we may not know, we want to ask users.
That's why user guidance
determines the clustering results.
That means different user preferences
may lead to the choice
of different meta-paths.
The problem is how the user can give you
the right meta-path or different weights.
Actually, the best is you
ask user to give some seeds
to give you the hint on desired clusters.
For example, okay,
if user say, I do not care but
I want 1 and
5 to be in different clusters.
You may get, set of cluster like this but
you say no, the user want to 1,
2, 5, 6 in four different clusters,
you may get
the reader like this, you may work
with a meta-path that is AOA plus AVA.
So the research problem
becomes we want user-guided
clustering with meta-path
selection it simply says
when we input target
type like the authors.
The number of clusters, k and
the seeds in some clusters,
that means you give some examples.
Then you give a set of
candidate meta-paths.
Then, what we want to work out is
the weight of each meta-paths and
also the clustering results that
consistent with user guidance.
This is the basic idea of PathSelClus,
a path selection doing clustering.
It is a Probabilistic Modeling Approach.
For the first part,
we'll remodel the relationship generation.
That means a good clustering
result should lead
to high likelihood in observing
the existing relationships.
That means we want high quality relations
to count more in the total likelihood.
Now how we should do this, actually,
we need to model the guidance from users.
That means, the more consistent
with the user guidance,
the higher probability of
the clustering result.
Then, the probability
model has another feature
it's modeling the quality
weights of meta-paths.
That means we want the more consistent
with the clustering result,
the higher quality weight.
So that means we can work out
this in a systematic way but
I will ignore the details,
you may read the paper.
But the general philosophy,
I can show it in this Yelp data.
The Yelp data for business reviews,
you may have review as the star center.
It counts as a set of terms.
A setup business, and a setup users.
Okay.
Then you may have different
relationship type.
That we may have,
say we may have two candidate paths.
B-R-U-R-B means these two business,
they are reviews, share some common users.
Then B R T R B means these business,
they reviews shares,
shares some common terms, okay.
Suppose we want to get our target objects
is clustering results the restaurants.
We want to get six clusters.
So you probably can see
the testing on the rear data sets.
You only select the 1% sample or
2% samples or 5% samples.
Then, if we look at accuracy or
normalize neutral information.
We proceed these path selection clus,
this algorithm,
in any case they generate far better
with that in some other algorithms.
Why?
Because the user gives some hint or
give some seeds based on the data sets,
you will work out a nice
way to the meta-paths.
And another interesting discovery
actually is if you look at
the restaurants to
clustering restaurants or
clustering shopping business for
example selling clothes then
you will find their meta-paths
weights are rather different.
For example for these,
Meta-paths B-R-U-R-B that means whether
it's business share or common users.
For restaurants, it weights much
less comparing for the terms.
Okay.
And also,
comparing to clustering shopping business.
Why?
Because you probably can see the different
people, actually the users, may like
to try different kinds of foods so they
may likely to go to different restaurants.
However, the users maybe shared more
by the shopping business like shopping
clothes just because for some very
expensive clothing store, you may attract
one group of user more regularly.
For some very cheap store, you may likely
to attract another group of users likely.
But the restaurants people
actually may try more varieties.
That's the reason you
get different weights.
So it is very subtle and
in many cases you have to derive
the weights based on the data instead
of based on your own thinking.
So in summary,
in this lecture we discussed Cluster
Analysis in Heterogeneous Networks.
We introduce the concepts of
heterogeneous information network and
how to do data mining in
heterogeneous information networks.
We discussed RankClus and
NetClus as two interesting
ranking-based clustering measures
in heterogeneous networks.
We also discussed a new similarity
measure called PathSim,
meta-path based similarity measure for
heterogeneous networks.
We then discussed how to use
user guidance to do meta-path
selection then we can do effective
clustering in heterogeneous networks.
Here I give you a set of
interesting research papers.
If you like to dig deeper,
you may like to read those papers.
And this is still a young theory,
there are lots of open research
problems people can work on.
Thank you.
