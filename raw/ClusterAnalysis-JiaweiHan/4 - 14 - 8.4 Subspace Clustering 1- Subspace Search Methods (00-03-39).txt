In this session we are going to
introduce the first kinds of
subspace clustering methods called,
Subspace Search Methods.
What is subspace search methods?
That means we try to search various
subspaces to find clusters.
The measures can be categorized into two
categories called bottom-up approaches and
top-down approaches.
For bottom-up approaches,
it starts from the low-D, the lowest D,
of course, it's one dimension subspaces.
Then you try to find dense regions,
and then you try and
search higher,
higher dimensions like two-D, three-D.
Only when you can find clusters or dense
regions in the low dimension space and
then you go to the high damaging
to find their candidates.
So there are various kind of pruning
techniques to reduce the number of high
dimension space to be searched.
For example, CLIQUE is introduced
as a grid based approach
by Agarwal There's a typical
bottom-up approach.
The top-down approach is
start from the full space and
search smaller sub-spaces recursively.
It is effective only if
the locality assumption holds.
That means we restrict our search
to those sub-spaces of cluster.
Because the sub-space can be
determined by the local neighborhood.
If we don't have this assumption,
don't have this locality assumption, so
the search may not be effective.
A typical method is PROCLUS
method by Cheryl Aggarwal.
A k-medoid-like method.
Then we just review what we did for
CLIQUE.
The CLIQUE, essentially is we start
from one dimension space like salary or
vacation, when these in 1-D,
they are dense.
You try to find the,
the greats In the 2-D candidates
because we're corresponding one
dimension space are pretty dense.
Okay, so
you find dense region in every such space.
And then you try to generate their
minimum descriptions like clusters.
Then you only use this dense region
to find promising candidates
in higher dimensional space.
For example, that when salary and
vacations in these parts,
are dense, you find their
intersections these are candidates
to check whether they are dense.
Only when they are dense,
then you try to find the higher
dimensional space candidates.
So, CLIQUE actually automatically
identifies these subspaces from
low to high.
Then it will terminate
when no more cluster or
cluster candidates can be found,
so you actually found all
the lower dimension subspace and
here you cannot go even higher.
