[SOUND] Now we examine distance
between categorical attributes,
ordinal attributes, and mixed types.
What are categorical attributes?
Categorical attributes are also called
nominal attributes because they
are a value referenced by names.
Take color as the example.
We may have a yellow,
red, orange, blue, green.
If forget their positions in the color
spectrum in physics, they are not ordered.
In that sense, either the two values
are the same or they are different.
The same is profession and
the many other things.
Then how to calculate their distance.
We can use simple matching method.
For example, suppose there are total
p variables and there are m matches.
Then the number of mismatch is p minus m.
So their distance between i and
j will be the number of mismatches
versus the total number of variables.
Another method is we can map
them into binary variables.
That means each value, like a red,
if they are existing as a red we write,
as 1.
If they are not red we write them as 0.
Then we can change
the categorical attributes ins,
into a set of binary variables.
Then we can use the previous
binary attribute
validation function to evaluate them.
Another kind of variable
called ordinal variables.
Ordinal variable means they do have order.
They, they can be discreet like a rank and
like a military rank or
even the rank for
a undergrad student in the university.
Or they could be continuous, like time.
Then order is becomes important.
For example, in the university
the freshman is a first year,
the senior is a fourth year student.
In that sense we can replace,
ordinary variable value by its rank.
Then we can map any particular
variable using this formula,
map them into either 0 or 1.
For example, we can map
a freshman into 0, because their
position is 1, 1 minus 1 is 0.
And the same for senior is four, so
by the total range is four
that's why they map into one.
Then the distance for
example between freshman and
senior would be 1 minus 0,
their distance is 1.
But between junior and senior,
their distance is only one third because with this formula.
Then we can compute their dissimilarity
using the interval scaled variables.
What about we get a dataset may
contain all attribute types.
Nominal, symmetric binary,
asymmetric binary, numeric numerical or
ordinal. Then we can use a weighted
formula to combine their effects.
Then, if there are numerical data,
we can use normalize the distance,
like [INAUDIBLE].
If they are binary or nominal data we can
use this formula, as we just discussed.
If they are ordinal data, we can compute
their distance using this formula.
Then we can combine all their effects
to compute their overall distance.
