[SOUND] In this session, we will discuss
Constraint-Based Clustering with
Constraints on Distance Measures.
Constraints on distance measures
is quite a real problem.
There is one research paper developed
by Anthony Tung, in ICDE, 2001,
spatial clustering in
the presence of obstacles.
This is pretty real problem in the sense,
if suppose you want to
find delivery centers.
Like at UPS and we want to deliver
to different households or
commercial centers.
So you don't want to assume ye, the, the,
the car can fly over the river or
highway or fly over even the lakes.
Whether you want to observe
the constraints on those obstacles and
you have to go over it by
crossing the bridge then you can
deliver your passers to the other side,
of the bank.
So to observe this constraints we
have thinking about how to do it.
The first thing is we probably should
use a K-medoids algorithm instead
of K-means because K-means may finally
locate the center of the service.
Right in the middle of the lake or
right in the middle of the river or
right on the highway.
Okay, so
this may not be quite desirable but
a K-medoids [INAUDIBLE] objects
it just says to be here.
However, to construct such clustering,
actually it is quite costly to compute.
The reason is every time we
use [INAUDIBLE] you have to
compute the distance of all the nearby
objects assigned to the center.
Calculate 30 cents,
say which one is closer and your center
by this object reassignment, you'll
recalculate center, center will change.
When the center's changed,
all this distance has to be recomputed so
this is very costly process.
How to efficient process it?
Okay, the first interesting thing is we
should thinking about triangulation and
a micro-clustering.
Triangulation essentially is
try the compute the visibility
graph because you use triangle within
this triangle, all things are visible.
You can base it on distance to compute
it but once you go to the other
triangles sometimes you have
to go over the vertices.
So you cannot do directly
compute being there you created
distance because they may have
to cross over the obstacles.
Then another important thing
is build those join indices
that is to pre compute
the shortest passes.
Why we have to build these join indices?
Just because you don't
want to compute it again,
again using, you know, the very similar
kind of thing to do recomputation.
If we computed the VV index,
the vertex to vertices index for
obstacles, that means you, you,
getting, you get this obstacle.
Another obstacle you want to
see their vertex to vertex,
how far away?Because in some cases
you have to go over these vertex eh,
then finally getting into another point
to calculate their distance, okay?.
Another is MV index, that means you
think about your micro-cluster,
you're thinking you do
the micro-cluster within the triangles.
And then you don't have to compute so
many points,
you take micro-cluster,
each cluster like one super object, okay?
So but we have to compute
a micro-cluster to the obstacle index.
For example, you compute this
micro-cluster to this one then you can you
will be able to compute their
distance in efficient way.
Because every micro-cluster to this
obstacle index then they link together
is the distance between
these two micro-clusters.
So the index surely will
speed up computation because
you don't have to recompute it.
Let's just look at examples,
we actually have two, the same
group of micro clusters and
same group of obstacles.
But one computation is we assume this
delivery center can fly over the rivers to
deliver things, probably in the future
those drones may be able to do it, okay,?
But it, the, the second one,
the right side one, is the one,
that means you have to observe the,
the obstacles.
For example, this center if they want to
deliver to the house over here they have
to observe, they can only go over those
vertex then they can go down there.
So, by observing these
obstacles as constraints,
as actually hard constraints then you'll
probably get a rather different kinds
of distance computations and
different kind of clusters, okay?
Actually, this study did
not consider highways,
there are some subsequent
studies even consider you can
only drive on the highways then
you can re-compute the distance.
Anyway, the general idea is the distance
computation may follow some constraints.
So this is constraint based
clustering with constraint
obstacles distance measures.
