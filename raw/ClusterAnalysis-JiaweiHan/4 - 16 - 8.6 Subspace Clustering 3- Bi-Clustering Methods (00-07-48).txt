[SOUND] In this session, we're going to
introduce a third kind
of subspace clustering
methods called bi-clustering methods.
What is bi-clustering?
Bi-clustering is to cluster both
objects and attributes simultaneously.
That means we treat objects and
attributes in a symmetric way.
Let's look at example.
Suppose we go to gene
expression data analysis.
We have rows.
Every row represents a gene.
We have m columns.
Every columns represents a sample or
a condition.
Essentially, these are the real
value represented expression level.
Then, we have four requirements
to find bi-clusters.
The first requirement is, only a small
set of objects participate in a cluster.
That means,
only some genes participate in a cluster.
Then, the second requirement is,
a cluster only involves
a small number of attributes.
Simply says, only some columns
are involved in the cluster.
Then the third line is an object may
participate in multiple clusters or
does not participate
in any cluster at all.
Simply says, some genes, some rows,
some genes may be in multiple clusters,
but there could be many genes that
are not in any cluster at all.
The first one is an attribute may
be involved in multiple clusters or
is not involved in any clusters at all.
That means some columns like
this condition, this sample,
could be involved in more
than one cluster, but
there could be many columns that
are not involving any cluster at all.
Then, a typical example is a gene
expression, or microarray data.
What you got is this matrix we call
gene sample, or gene condition matrix.
So each element in the matrix
represent real number,
it records the expression level of
a gene under a certain condition.
Another example could be customer,
and product, their relationships.
This simply says, one customer may
be involved in these bi-cluster,
in more than one cluster.
But, at some product, also may be
involved in more than one cluster.
Or some product may not be
involving any cluster at all.
Now we look at the types of bi-clusters.
Suppose we get a set of genes and
a set of conditions.
Bi-cluster essentially try to
find a submatrix like this.
The genes and conditions follow
some nice consistent patterns.
We can look at different ideal cases.
Could be we may find
one kind of bi-cluster,
or could be every value
just like a constant.
Like if this one is 10,
these are all 10s is,
idea of constant value sub-cluster and
this bi-cluster is very idea but
it barely can see such cases.
The second case is the bi-cluster
with constant value in rows.
That means each row in this bi-cluster,
they have a constant value.
The third one could be,
the bi-cluster have some coherent value.
That means they have certain pattern.
This, aka, means as no,
as pattern-based clusters.
For example, we can see here, you may
observe some relation like if you've
increased by 10, so everything just
like a copy, and here increased 30,
every year like a copy, decrease by 50,
every row also like a copy.
That is also ideal case.
The last one could be if
all these rows in a column.
They have the relationship.
It's hard to find.
For example, this increased by 10,
this by 30, but this is by 50.
This is by 0.
If you find this,
what is the relationship?
And we find the relationship
is the increase or
decrease follow the same trend.
Simply says, you look at the corresponding
two cells, you will say,
if 0increase,
the other one is also increase their
product will be greater than zero.
Okay, or, y, increase the other
one at least maintain the same, so
it's equal to 0.
If they are decreased, that simply says,
you get negative and negative.
They multiply still positive.
So that means, you're only interested
in up- or down- regulated changes.
In that case,
this is another kind of pattern.
Then, in the real-world data, they cannot
be so ideal like we Illustrate above.
That means the real-world data is noisy.
We try to find not ideal bi-clusters, but
we try to find approximate bi-clusters.
Essentially, there's two kinds of methods,
one called optimization-based methods,
another called enumeration-based methods.
The optimization-based method is trying to
find submatrices only one at a time but
we try to achieve the best
significance as a bi-cluster.
Simply it says, we try to find
the best one we can find each time.
However, the computation is very costly.
Try to find best one may
not be quite realistic.
The best is to use a greedy search
to find local optimal bi-clusters.
That means in, locally, this is best,
globally, it may not be.
Okay.
Then, one such algorithm called
data bi-cluster algorithm
developed by Cheng and Church in ISMB,
published in International Symposium
of Molecular Biology inspiring
from ethics conference.
Another way is enumeration base method.
The method essentially is,
to use a tolerance threshold.
That means, as long as they
are approximate, the follow within certain
threshold, we can specify the degree
of noise allowed in the bi-cluster.
Then we try to enumerate all
these sub-matrices as bi-clusters
that satisfy the requirements.
Trying to find this is like
a pattern analysis, so
one algorithm called delta p cluster,
algorithm developed
by [INAUDIBLE] Wang's group,
published in 2002's SIGMOD Conference.
Their further refinement, called MaPle,
was published by Jan Pei and
others in ICDM conference.
