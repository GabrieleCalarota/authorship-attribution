Welcome to lecture 9.
Constraint-Based Clustering.
In this lecture we're going to
discuss why do we want to do
constraint-based clustering.
We will study different
categories of constraints.
We will study how to do
constraint-based clustering.
For example, how to handle hard
constraints, how to handle soft
constraints, how to encopper constraints,
and distance measures.
Finally, we will discuss
user-guided constraints.
That means taking users
hints as constraints.
So at first discuss, why do we want
to do constraint-based clustering?
Constraint-based clustering
means clustering
by taking user-specified
constraints into consideration.
Usually, this kind of clusterings,
also called semi-supervised clustering.
Because they are often in the form
like cannot link, must link.
Cannot link means these two objects
must be in separate clusters.
Must link means these two points or
two sub-clusters must be linked together,
must be in the same cluster.
Constrained based clusters
can be much broader.
For example, we can take a distance
constraints, user-guidance constraints,
user may specify different
numbers of clusters,
may specify the granularity of clusters.
All of these can be taken as constraints.
Constraint-based clustering
actually is very useful.
It's highly desirable.
Why?
Because users usually know there
applications the best.
Also you use more user-desired
constraints and guidance.
You can take less parameters.
There are many,
many applications they may like to use,
user guided or
constraint based clustering.
For example, if you want to group
students into different groups,
people may ask why do you
want to group those students?
Are you considering
different kinds of awards?
Or do you want to organize parties?
You thinking different food or
different costumes?
And we probably can look at this, map.
Suppose we want to allocate
some delivery centers.
For example, you want some UPS or
Federal Express.
You want to have different centers, you
can deliver it to the house, in a city.
However when you think about this,
you cannot just use Euclidean distance
to compute the center of a cluster.
Because usually the cars
cannot fly over the rivers.
They have to go through the highways,
they cannot cross mountains or lakes.
So they have to go around it.
Also there could be available roads,
they may even consider traffic,
and other things.
So that means, we, in many applications,
will have to consider our
constraints when we do clustering.
