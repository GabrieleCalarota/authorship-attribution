Hi, welcome to lecture one,
Cluster Analysis: An Introduction.
In this first lecture,
we're going to introduce the basic
concepts of Cluster Analysis.
We are going to discuss
what is cluster analysis?
The applications of cluster analysis,
the requirements and
challenges of cluster analysis and
we will pre, then clus,
cluster analysis from a multi-dimensional point of view,
essentially it's
a multi-dimensional categorization.
Where we'll provide an overview on
typical clustering methodologies and
overview on clustering
different types of data,
an overview on user insights and
clustering.
And finally,
we'll provide a summary of this lecture.
So the first session is on
what is cluster analysis?
To understand what is Cluster Analysis,
we should know first, what is a cluster?
The cluster is actually
a collection of data objects,
those objects are similar
within the same cluster.
That means, the objects are similar to
one another within the same group and
they are rather different or
they are dissimilar or
unrelated to the objects in other
groups or in other clusters.
Okay.
Then cluster analysis,
which is also called clustering or
data segmentation.
Essentially is given a set of data points.
The cluster analysis is to partition them
into a set of cluster or say, groups.
They are sim, as similar as
possible within the same group and
as far apart,
as possible amount different groups.
Cluster analysis is unsupervised
learning in the sense
there's no predefined classes.
This is very different
from classification,
which needs supervised learning or
needs to given the class labels,
then you can construct
the classification models.
There are many ways to use or
apply cluster analysis.
Essentially, cluster analysis can
either provide as a stand alone
tool to get inside into your data
distribution, like a summary.
Okay.
Or you can serve, you can use it to serve
as a pre-processing step or
intermediate step for other algorithms,
like classification or
prediction or, you know,
like other many other tasks including
data mining and other applications.
Thank you.
