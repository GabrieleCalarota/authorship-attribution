[SOUND] Welcome to
Lecture 11.
Cluster Analysis in
Heterogeneous Networks.
We have discussed Cluster Analysis in
Graphs and in Homogeneous Networks.
Now we come down to Cluster Analysis
in Heterogeneous Networks.
We will first introduce what
a Heterogeneous Information Networks.
We will then discuss a RankClus algorithm,
NetClus algorithm,
PathSim measures,
that means PathSim similarity search
based on PathSim measure for
Heterogeneous Networks.
We will finally discuss
the User Guided Meta-Path Selection for
Clustering in Heterogeneous Networks.
First, we're going to
introduce the basic concepts
of Heterogeneous Information Networks.
What are Heterogeneous
Information Networks?
We first see what other networks.
Okay.
And networks actually are the nodes
represent an entity or
we call vertex, okay.
Like a actor in a social network and
then we have links or we call edges,
essentially it's a tie in a social
relationship between entities.
Then we can consider each note or
each link may have attributes,
labels and weights.
Okay.
Link may also carry rich
semantic information.
For networks, we can categorize them into
homogeneous versus heterogeneous networks.
Homogeneous networks
are the single object type and
single node type, like France and
France link with France.
Like world wide web, you can think
it's a collection of linked web pages.
So you get similar kinds of web pages.
And a web page link page
by pointing to those pages,
so you are looking for
single object type and single link types.
However, in reality, there are many things
are heterogeneous, multi-type networks.
That means the network actually consists
of multiple typed objects and the links.
For example, in a medical network,
you will see patients, doctors,
diseases, contacts and
treatments and drugs and
all of these actually can interconnected
together to form a medical network.
Similarly for people in a bibliographic
network, you may see publications and
they contain authors,
they publish in certain venues and
other information, other pieces.
Okay.
So for example, for DBLP, which is
computer science bibliographic database,
it contains over 2million paper entries.
This is a typical bibliographic network.
Now we take the bibliographic
information network as an example,
if we see there, we have a papers.
They link to venue, they link to
terms they link to authors and
the paper may cite other papers.
And for this model,
we can think how much in this network.
Actually, can often be derived from
their original heterogeneous networks.
For example, coauthor networks.
You can think if the different authors,
they share a same paper id.
You're thinking they actually
are forming coauthors,
but you can think this coauthor network
actually is a projection of these
more complete heterogeneous networks.
Similarly, citation network,
paper citation network also can be
derived from this original
heterogeneous networks.
However, heterogeneous networks
carry richer information than their
corresponding projected
homogeneous networks.
Take a coauthor network as example.
If you just know A and B are coauthoring
a paper, but you do not know whether
they only cross at one paper or many
papers, what paper they are coauthoring,
discussing what kind of themes,
publishing what kind of venues, so
you lose lots of information if you
just look at coauthor networks.
So another important thing is type
heterogeneous network versus non
type heterogeneous network.
If you look at the, like, a.
If you don't type them, you think every
word, distinct word is a single type.
So you get a, you connect them together.
You say,
this word is similar to the other word.
Actually, it's very hard to make
good use of such information.
However, once you type them,
these typed nodes and
links may imply more
structures in the network and
may use such structures to get
a rich knowledge discovery.
That's why our goal is
we try to mine typed
semi-structured heterogeneous
information networks.
From there, we will study clustering,
ranking, classification, prediction,
similarity search.
We can do a lot of a very powerful things,
we again to focus in this
lecture on cluster analysis
in heterogeneous information networks.
