[SOUND] In this session,
we're going to introduce graphs,
and networks, their basic concepts,
and their representations.
So, what is a network or graph?
A network or graph,
usually treated like synonyms.
A graph G is referenced
by a set of vertices,
V, or also called nodes,
for some literature.
And a set of edges, E, or
some people call it a set of links.
E actually is a subset of
V cross product with V.
Then n is the number of vertices,
also called order of G.
M is the number edges,
also called the size of G.
The multi-edge means if
there exist more than one
edge linking between the two vertices,
for example one two.
If there were more than one edge,
we call this as a multi-edge graph.
Okay.
And also,
the loop means edge connects
a vertex to itself.
Usually we call this is a self-loop.
For example, if you get one,
you get another edge also connected to
one directly, that's a self-loop.
For simple network, we will not
consider self-edges or multi-edges.
Then if we want a rapid and
this simple network we'll
reference as adjacency matrix.
If i and j is one it simply says,
there's an edge connecting
between a vertex i and a j.
Okay.
Then otherwise it's a zero.
Okay?
Directed graph simply says the edge may
have directions like tail upon to head.
In that case if the adjacency
matrix A sub i j equals 1,
it means there is an edge
from j to i is directed.
Otherwise it's a zero,
if there's no such directed edge.
Sometimes the graph may not just a one or
zero, they may have certain weights
associated with every edge.
Weighted W sub i j,
usually it's a real number,
it's associated with each vertex,
each edge of v i, sub i j.
Then this graph is a weighted graph.
Then we see how to define
the vertex degrees.
Suppose we get network G consist
of a set of vertices and edges.
For undirected network, essentially,
there is no direction like this graph,
then the degree of a vertex
is defined as how many edges from
the other ones going down here.
Going in and out are just the same,
because it's undirected.
So, for example, okay.
We give it A obviously
the number of edges containing,
connecting to A is four,
that's why the degree is four.
Similarly the degree of H is two.
Then we look at directed network.
Directed network, the in-degree is how
many edges pointing to these v sub i.
Okay.
For example,
if you look at the in-degree of A,
you can see there's three
edges pointing to A.
That's why in-degree of A is three.
The in-degree of B is two, obviously.
Out-degree just reversed, look at how
many edges actually going out of it.
Okay.
From v sub i.
Then if you look at A's outgoing edges,
you will find only one.
But B's outgoing edges, you can find two.
So that's the basic concepts of vertex and
degrees.
