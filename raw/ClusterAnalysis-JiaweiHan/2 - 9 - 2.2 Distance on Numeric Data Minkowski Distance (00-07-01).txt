Now we examine session two, Distance
on Numeric Data Minkowski Distance.
So we first introduce Data Matrix and
Dissimilarity Matrix or distance matrix.
Data matrix is rep in the typical
matrix form is we have n data points,
we use n rows.
We have I dimensions, we use I
columns to represent this data set.
The distance matrix or
dissimilarity matrix usually is rep in
triangular matrix because
you have n data points,
we register only the distance
between like objects.
1 versus 1 or 2 versus 1 to
look at their distance, 'kay?
But the distance function usually could be
quite different with different kinds of
variables like real, boolean, categorical,
ordinal, ratio and vector variables.
Their distance definition
could be different.
Moreover, sometime they may have
weights associated with those
different variables based
on the applications and
data semantics,
we're going to introduce this more later.
Then we look at an example,
suppose we have four points,
four objects in two dimensional space.
Then the data matrix is represented
in this typical form, 'kay?
Then for dissimilarity matrix or
distance matrix or
Euclidean distance you can see
the matrix is in this way.
That X1, X1,
they are identical their distance is zero.
X2, X1 their computation
is based on the distance.
This part is 2, this distance is 3,
you take sum of the square,
you take square root you get this value.
Then in general, we define the
Minkowski Distance as this formula that
means if we have l dimensions for
object i and object j.
Then their distance is defined
by taking every dimension to like,
look their absolute value of their
distance then to the power of p.
Then you sum them up, get the root of p,
then we get the Minkowski distance.
Such distance the p is the order,
we usually also call this
distance as L-p norm.
The Minkowski distance in general
they have these properties.
The first property is called positivity,
it means the distance
must be 0 when they are identical,
otherwise they are greater than 0.
The second property callled symmetry,
means the distance between i and
j, distance between j and
i should be identical.
Then, the third one called
triangle inequality means for
the distance between i and j.
If you go through k, that means
you go first to k then from k to j
that distance should be no less
than directly go from i to j.
Should be you know, greater than or
equal to directly go to i to j.
The distance measure that satisfy these three
properties called metric distance,
notice not all the distance are metric.
For example, set distance is not metric,
of course in this lecture,
we mainly discuss metric distance.
Then look, we look at some special
cases of Minkowski distance.
If p equals to 1, we call L1 norm,
they also call Manhattan or
city block distance define this formula.
In particular,
if we are dealing with binary vectors,
we call these as a Hamming distance it's
the number of bits that are different.
Then, if p equals 2 is defined also called
L2 norm is Euclidean distance defined
in the typical way like this.
This is very familiar one eh,
I think for all the people, 'kay?
Then if p goes to infinity
means we're dealing with
L infinity norm or L max norm.
This is also called supremum distance is
defined is a limit for p goes to infinity.
In that case,
actually the distance is really
the maximum difference between
any attribute of the vectors.
For example, you can see for
f from 1 to l,
the maximum such absolute
value of the distance is
the distance of l infinity norm or
supremum distance.
Let's look at some examples, for
the same data sets like we get four
points, we get two dimensions.
Then we look at the Manhattan
distance is just based on
delete there's a city block distance,
for example from X2 to XY.
You will go three blocks
down then two blocks left so
the Manhattan distance is
3 plus 2, you get 5, okay?
Of course X1 to X1 itself is 0.
And Euclidean distance as we discussed
already that's the measure for
supremum distance L infinity norm,
you can see X2 to X1.
So probably you can see the difference
is you first go down three blocks
from Manhattan distance you
can see you get a 3 plus 2.
But for supermum distance,
you just see which attribute get
a maximum distance or maximum difference.
So you probably can see the maximum is 3
instead of 2 that's why X2 to X1 is 3.
So it's pretty easy to compute.
Thank you.
