In this section,
we are going to introduce CLIQUE.
A grid-based subspace
clustering algorithm.
This algorithm CLIQUE, actually is
abbreviation of Clustering in QUEst.
QUEst is IBM data mining system.
It was developed by a group
of researchers at IBM.
It was published in
SIGMOD 1998 Conference.
CLIQUE is a density-based,
grid-based subspace clustering algorithm.
Why it is grid-based?
Because it discretizes the data
space through a grid structure and
estimates the density by counting
the number of points in the grid cell.
Why it is a density-based?
Because a cluster actually
is a maximum set of
connected dense units in the subspace.
That means a unit is dense if
the fraction of the total data
points contained in the units
exceeds certain parameter,
then you try to connect it those
dense units into a structure,
into a cluster that it is density-based.
Why it is subspace clustering?
Because it starts from a low dimension,
like a sinker damage.
For this particular subspace,
you try to find neighborhood
dense cells in arbitrary subspace and
that you can grow into a to 2D,
3D and
find the maximum number of dimensions.
In the subspace, it contains clusters.
It also disco, discovers some
minimum description of the clusters.
That means for this particular algorithm,
it automatically
identifies the subspaces of a high
dimension data space that allows
a better clustering than the original
space using the Apriori principle.
Let's look at an example.
Okay.
Suppose we want to find
the clusters based on salary,
age and number of vacation weeks.
And we can first, start one dimension
to find out where are the dense parts.
For example if you just look at salary,
you may find the salary,
the dense points is 20k to 50k.
That part is pretty dense,
especially around 40k.
You'll find that the ages,
it is pretty dense between 30 To 50, okay?
And is very few.
Probably, the lower ones.
Then based on number of vacation,
you probably can see
the vacation is clustered
around the two to four weeks.
That means we find dense
region in each subspace,
then generate their minimum descriptions.
Then we use this dense region to
find a promising candidates in 2-D
space based on the Apriori principal.
Simply says, you find it's dense and
1-D on salary and a 1-D on age.
Then you probably can find that
they are ca, combined one.
That means you try to find clusters
within this candidate space.
Similarly, you can find
clusters within the candidates
space in salary and, and the vacation.
Okay.
Then we can repeat this process
in the level-wise manner in
high dimension subspace.
Using the Apriori principle,
simply says if you find
a dense in this 2-D part and
this 2-D part,
then you might find the candidates
in the 3-D region based
on their intersections.
So the major step of
CLIQUE algorithm is first,
try to identify subspace
that contains clusters.
That means we can partition the database
space into the grid structure,
then find the number of points that
lie inside each cell of the partition.
Then try to identify the subspaces
that contain the clusters
using the Apriori principle.
Then that means we try to identify
clusters as a second step.
Determine the dense units in
all subspace of the interest,
then we determine the connected dense
units in all the subspaces of interest.
Then we'll regenerate the minimum
descriptions of the cluster.
That means determine the maximal
regions that cover the cluster of
the connected dense units then determine
the minimal cover of each cluster.
So this method,
the interesting points is it
automatically finds the subspaces of
the highest dimensionality
as long as the high
density cluster exists in those subspace.
Because you find a 2-D,
you try to find their intersection.
If the 2-D form a cluster,
the intact intersection at
a 3-D space, likely you may
be able to find clusters and
it is insensitive to the order of records.
We input and also let's not assume
a particular data distribution.
And it's scales linearly with the size
of the input and has good scalability
as the number of dimensions in
the data when the data increases.
Well, this is quite efficient algorithm.
The weakness of the method is essentially,
because use, you,
we use the grid-based clustering approach.
So the quality of the results would
depends on how to choose the number and
width of the partitions and
the grid cells.
Nevertheless, it's a very interesting
subspace clustering method.
Then for this lecture,
we do a simple summary as we introduced
density-based clustering and
a grid-based clustering.
We introduce the basic concept
of the density-based clustering.
We introduce DBSCAN and optics methods and
we also introduce the concept
of grid-based clustering.
We introduce the sting and
the CLIQUE that's two interesting
grid-based algorithms.
Finally, I should say,
all the original papers on these
density-based and
grid-based clustering are listed.
Also, for Charu Aggarwal and
Reddy's book there are two chapters.
One is called Density-Based Clustering
by Martin Ester.
Another is called Grid-Based Clustering
by Cheng, Wang and Batista.
They have a very good summary and
also introduce many more methods on
density-based clustering and
the grid-based clustering methods.
