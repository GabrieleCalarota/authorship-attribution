[SOUND] In this session we are going to
discuss how to handle soft constraints
in constraint based clustering.
Soft constraints means you have must
link and cannot link constraints.
You better observe it,
because you pay less cost.
If you aren't not observing this
constraint to to go over this constraint,
you have to pay some penalty.
So that means we will treat
constraint based clustering
as a optimization problem.
That means when the clustering
violates a soft constraints,
a penalty should be imposed
on the clustering, okay.
Then the overall objective is we want
to optimize the clustering quality and
also minimizing the constraint
violation penalty.
Let's look at one example algorithm
called constrained vector
quantization error algorithm,
or called CVQE algorithm.
That algorithm is to conduct
a k-means clustering while enforcing
constraint violation penalties.
Let's look how these method works, okay.
So there's a objective function.
That means we use some of
the distance used in the k-means but
it is adjusted by the constraint
violation penalties.
For example if the clustering
violate the must-link constraints.
What the penalty should be
obtained is if objects x and
y must be linked that means they have
must-link constraints tied with it.
They should be assigned to the same
cluster based on the must-linked,
however now suppose you assign them to
two different clusters, C one and C two.
Then you should add a penalty
distance between C one and C two,
is added to the object function as
the penalty when you optimize it,
you try to reduce the penalty.
That means you try to, you know,
assign them to different clusters.
Then what is penalty for
a cannot-link violation?
That means if objects and
y cannot be linked but
now you put them into the same cluster.
That means you assigned to
a same cluster center c.
Then we should have object to
function added to it as a penalty.
The ob,
the adding y is the distance between c and
c prime,
where c is the currently assigned center,
c prime is the closest center to
c that can accommodate x or y.
