And let's build up our
notation step by step.
I should warn you that, yes, the notation
is going to get a little hairy, but
there is going to be a value
at the end of all of this.
At the end of all of this,
we're going to have a formal edifice,
a structure on which independence
crops up, essentially, for free, okay?
And this is just a drought
of well worth the candle.
So let's begin with a consideration
of a compound experiment broken up
into two individual chance
experiments to independent trials.
The first trial results in
a space of possible results,
we will call it gothic A.
And gothic A is a set of possibilities,
which I shall denote a sub j.
J running over a finite or
contemply infinite range.
So for
example in a coin toss a1 was heads,
in this case a green head and
a2 was a green tail.
Right, but now more generally if you
imagine that the first trial in roll or
through of a die then the age is
could be the numbers one through six.
The atomic mass function here need not
be combinatorial anymore in general.
In other words, we can assign atomic
probabilities to individual masses for
the first trial.
To the mass aj assign a chance p subject.
Excellent, color coded green,
keep in mind, that this represents
things for the first trial.
The experiment is not concluded.
We're now going to do
another change experience.
A second individual chance experiment,
a second trial.
It's results are captured in a set
that's called a gothic b and
gothic b can be a finite or infinite set.
Let's call the elements of gothic b,
b sub k, where k ranges over
various finite or infinite ranges.
We're going to call it b sub j
instead a rows by any other name would
smell as sweet.
We are indexed j or k here just either
define of various elements in the set.
But it'd be nice and
wise to keep the indexes
representing the generic results of
the first and second trials separate.
So, let's use an index j for the first
trial, and index k for the second trial.
Of course j and
k are generic algebraic variables.
We color code this let's
say by a blue color.
So gothic b and
the various elements of gothic b are the
potential results of the second trial.
It's a chance driven experiment
a nd therefore we want to allocate
chances to each of these atoms.
To the atom b sub k,
suppose we allocate a chance, q sub k.
Nothing says that the experiments
have to be the same, for
example we could throw a die, as the first
trial and toss a coin as the second trial.
What matters is that they've got
a finite or contemply infinite range of
possibilities and that for each of these
possibilities you've got an atomic chance.
P sub j in the first case,
q sub k in the second.
Now we're going to stitch these two
together to form a compound experiment.
We shall call the resulting
sample space a product space for
natural reasons and the resulting
probability measure a product measure.
The sample space omega
is now the Cartesian product
of gothic a with gothic b.
What does this mean?
The sample points are ordered pairs.
A sub j, result of the first trial,
covered together with b sub k, resulting
from the second trial, j and k ranging of
all possible indexes in your index sets.
And now, we naturally have
what we call a product space,
you have taken a cartesian
product of two trials.
What makes things independent is the
specification of the probability measure.
I'm giving you a discrete setting, a
finite or a countably infinite setting for
this compound experiment.
It suffices to provide an atomic mas
function to every atom and probability.
What are the atoms in this game here?
The atoms are ordered pairs,
first trial, second trial.
Suppose the first trial
results in the result a sub j.
The second trial results in b sub k,
then we have an atom.
A sub k, bk,
to which we attach the probability,
p sub j times q sub k,
this is where the independent trial
part of the experiment comes into play.
Independent trials means that
the compound probability mass function
is obtained by taking as
a product the individual masses.
Once you've got this in play, we can
now start stitching together evidence.
Okay now we can need
a little more notation.
Keep in mind the key idea, if you're
an event determined solely by the first
trial, it should, if we've said our
prayers at night and been very good,
be independent of an event specified
solely in terms of the second trial.
We have now set up what the product
space is for the compound experiment.
A system of pairs, a cartesian product and
this is the key element.
What it meant to have a product measure?
This is at heart what we
mean by independent trials.
The atomic probabilities multiply
to give us the atomic probability for
the ordered pair.
We should now set up events and
again the key idea is
to set up events which depend
upon separate trials and
event A which depends only upon
the results of the first trial and
an event B which depends solely on
the results of the second trial.
We're going to need formalism so
notation to carry us through this.
What does it mean for
an event to determine, or
to be determined by the first trial?
It means that,
that event is ultimately determined by
some sub-group of possible results
of the first trial that occur.
We identify the locations of
that subgroup with let us
blackboard j representing
a collection of indices,
representing locations of points in
the set of possibilities gothic A.
So, blackboard j represents say
this location, this location,
that location one, three,
nine for example, okay?
likewise we set up a system of
possibilities for the second trial.
Blackboard K represents a collection
of outcomes results of trial two.
Again these collections j and k could
be finite or even countably in finite.
Okay, what does it mean to say that an
event a depends only on the first trial?
Well if a occurs whenever
the results of the first trial
were any of the tagged locations
identified by blackboard j.
Then we will say that a was
determined by the first trial.
Let's put this in notation,
the elements tagged by blackboard j in
the first set gothic a, give you a subset
of gothic a, call that gothic s.
Just temporarily, as a nonce notation.
Gothic s represents a collection,
a sub-collection of results
of the first trial which
are identified by a particular set of
locations, a set of indices, Blackboard j.
An event A,
which is determined by just that set
in a formal sense depends only on
trial one, what does this mean?
Suppose A is an event, a system of pairs,
where the first element a sub j is one
of the tagged elements in gothic s.
The second result, the second element,
b sub k, representing the result of
the second trial, is completely
unfettered, can be anything whatsoever.
The first element is constrained
to a particular set,
the second element is unconstrained.
Naturally we will say A is
determined by the first trial.
It occurs or not occurring is not
dependant upon the second trial,
it only depends on what
happened in the first trial.
Likewise, an event B, which depends
only on those results identified or
tagged by the blackboard k set
of indices for the second trial.
And does not depended upon the first
trial is a system of pairs, a,
j, b, k, where aj, now, the result of
the first trial is completely unfettered.
Whereas the result, bk, the result of
the second trial, is one of an identified
subset of possibilities which
are identified let's say by gothic t.
In a very natural sense
A depends on trial one,
B depends on trial two, we would
anticipate that they are independent.
Now what does independence for
pairs of events mean, and
we have a rule of products for
intersection probabilities.
And therefore we need to construct a third
event, the event A intersection B.
I'm going to call this a rectangular event
because of a graphical
reason I'll come to shortly.
What, what does A intersection B mean?
A intersection B is now
subset of ordered pairs,
a sub j for the first trial,
b sub k for the second trial.
Where a sub j is the paired group
of the first trial and b sub k is
the paired group of the second trial.
In other words, now the first and
second trials are both not unfettered.
A sub j has to be one of
an identified sub group,
b sub k has to be one of
an identified sub group.
We'll call such intersections rectangular
for simple graphical reasons.
If you imagine that the subset of indices
Blackboard J represents let's say
the interval shown in the upper right of
the screen and the subset of indices,
blackboard K, represents
a another interval on your screen.
Then if you allow the first
index to be in blackboard J,
the second index should be unaffected,
you get a strip.
If you allow the,
the second index to only in blackboard K,
the first index to be unfettered, you
get another this time horizontal strip.
The intersection of those
two give you indices
where the first element is in blackboard J
and the second element is in blackboard K,
in other words,
you get visually a rectangle.
Okay now we abstract this principle and
call such sets in general,
general rectangular sets.
Okay?
All this means is that the first
element varies freely over some set.
The second element varies
freely over some of the set and
the result is what we
call a rectangular set.
Of course, what matters now is what are
the chances of all of these events, and
does a rule of products emerge.
Let's pause and take a look at this now.
First, we start with the individual
chance experiments and
we're allocating mass
functions to each of them.
P sub j for the first,
q sub k for the second.
Naturally enough, the mass functions
have to be non-negative and
they have to be properly normalized.
All possibilities for
the first trial have to add to one.
All possibilities for
the second trial have to add to one.
So the pj's add to one,
and the qk's add to one.
Excellent, this is setting the stage we're
now looking at the compound experiment.
Now, in the component experiment,
we're looking at ordered pairs and
a mass function allocates probability pj,
qk to the atom consisting
of the order pair aj bk.
Our first question should be, well this is
a by fiat of definition,
which is writing down what we say,
what we claim is going to give
us a probability measure.
Does it in fact give us
a probability measure?
Now, if you multiply two non-negative
numbers you're going to get a non-negative
number so positivity's trite.
The atomic measure is going to
give you a non-negative number.
The question is,
is it properly normalized?
And of course this should be checked,
right?
This is a sanity check to make
sure the foundation is solid.
So, we want to add up
over all possibilities,
the atomic probabilities
which are of the form pjqk.
But it is sum over all j and all k,
we can simply separate the subs into
a sum over j of pj times
the sum over k of qk.
Each of the terms in the round
brackets is one because the individual
mass functions with a digital
trials asked you to be anomalized.
So we get one times one, or in fact, one.
This atomic measure is,
in fact, suitably normalised.
It gives rise to bona
fide probability measure.
Now, let's turn to the events.
What can I say about
a change of the event A.
Naturally enough by we sum over all
possibilities for the atoms in A.
What are the atoms in A?
Well they are pairs, aj,
bk, where J arranges where
an identified subset of integer indices,
blackboard J.
K is authentic.
Can range over all indices.
Ak in the sum,
factors into a product of two sums.
You're first in the wrong brackets
is a sum over a restricted range for
the index j or the item defined locations
for the first trial over blackboard j.
Some of our indices in blackboard
j off the probabilities b sub j.
The second term in wrong brackets just
sums overall possibilities for q.
But the q case are probably
normalized They add to one
the second term vanishes quietly.
Like [INAUDIBLE] leaving
you simply just a sum
over a restricted range of intercedes
blackboard J of the probability B J.
Likewise, an entirely analogous argument
gets us the probability
of the [INAUDIBLE] B.
To get this probability we have to
sum over all atomic probabilities for
the atoms in B.
The atoms in B are pairs aj,
bk where j is unfettered, but
k now is in a restricted group,
a blackboard K divide ahead of time.
The first sub knowledge one, because
the pj's are properly normalized, and so
we now get an expression for
the probability of B,
as a sum over blackboard K,
of the probabilities QK.
Right.And now the million dollar question.
What can you you say about the probability
of the intersection of A with B?
Again, the sum of all possibilities, but
now we're looking at ordered pairs where
the index j has to lie in the ID
defied subset black board j.
The index k has to lie the ID
defied subset black board k.
We separate the sum again to a pro,
into a product of two terms.
The first term in round brackets is
exactly what we added to find as
a probability in a.
The second term in round brackets
is exactly what we added to find
as a probability of the event b and
therefor inevitably,
the probability of a intersection b
is exactly the probability of
A times the probability of B.
And rule of products has magically
emerged from this notational mess.
Of course you realize that this
argument is impeccable however I choose
the identified set of indices j,
however I choose the particular subset.
Of gothic a that triggers
the first event and
however I chose the second subset
of indices, gothic, blackboard k
which gives us a subset of gothic b and
therefor we've discovered that.
Any events a and b so constructed,
where a is determined by the first trial
in the sense that I've outlined here,
and b is determined by the second trial,
again in this sense, any two such
events are forced to be independent,
provided the probability
measure is obtained.
By multiplying independent probabilities,
the probability measure is
a product measure obtained by multiplying
probabilities from independent trials.
Here is a wonderful general principle.
Notice, the moment I can make this claim,
the moment I can identify
events like this.
The necessity for
checking independence goes away.
The moment events can be so broken up
we automatically get independence.
This is what I mean by the necessity for
checking independence
is not there anymore.
Independence is now
transparent in such a setting.
Our next step now, of course, is to
take what we've done for two trials, and
quickly expand it into many, many
trials and this is what comes up next.
