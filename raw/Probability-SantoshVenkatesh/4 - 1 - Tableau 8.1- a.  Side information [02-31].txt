Characterising side information
in chance experiments; the role
of conditional probability.
Thus far in our development,
we've started with a preamble on
the nature of chance around us.
Building on this,
we took steps towards the construction of
an exumatic foundation for
the theory of probability.
By considering chance and
common place experiments around us.
We now have a formal
mathematical framework.
And we wish to build upon this.
As a first step,
we will explore tributaries from
the main stream as it were.
To understand something about the nature
of the construct we have built up.
We shall start, by considering the nature
of side information on chance processes.
Now, the idea of information on the side.
About some aspect or the other,
of a problem in real life.
It's familiar to us in varied and
diverse settings.
For example, in public policy
the idea of insider trading
on the financial markets has,
of course, a disreputable air.
It conveys inside information
with a certain oh,
socially charged to
morally charged flavor.
There are other aspects
of side information,
where one gets innocuous side
information about some process.
Without necessarily any kind of moral or
ethical flavor.
And one can imagine various kinds of
settings like this, where information
arises, related to something which
is chance driven which is going on.
And this information sheds light
upon the underlying process.
Our job today is to try
to come up with a formal,
articulate mathematical foundation for
what should characterize side information.
And, as always, we will begin with the
idea of chance in very simple settings.
So that we can extract in,
intuition for the problem and
build upon this a formal foundation.
