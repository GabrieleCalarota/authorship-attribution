Tableau 9, Part 2.
Repeated independent trials,
product spaces.

The thread or skin of independence runs
right through the story of probability.
In many ways,
it is the central concept in the science.
Now, thus far, we've built up an idea
of independence for a pair of events.
It is now time to build
upon this structure.
And think about independence in a rather
more abstract and general fashion.
At it heart, the idea of independence
is codified in the elementary
mathematical observation that
independent possibilities multiply.
Let's go back again to simple settings
where we have a finite number of elements,
and we start putting together
extended multiplication tables.
If you recall in Tableau 9, Part 1,
we started by looking at an ordinary
multiplication table where we had two
elements, a row and a column building
up an array of possibilities.
Now let's move on to a setting
slightly more abstract
where we have three alphabets.
To distinguish them,
we'll use Gothic, upper-case letters,
Fancy A, Gothic B, and Gothic C
respectively for these three alphabets.
We will deal with a certain amount of
abstraction by assuming that the first
alphabet, Gothic A, has got let us say,
L elements, labeled A1 through AL.
The alphabet Gothic B has got, say,
M elements, labeled B1 through BM.
And the alphabet Gothic C has got, let us
say, N elements, labeled C1 through CN.
Now the dimensionality is still small
enough that we can visualize this.
For example, by a three-dimensional cube.
Imagine writing down the elements of
the alphabet Gothic A along the x-axis.
The elements of the alphabet
Gothic B in the y-axis.
And the elements of Gothic C
along the zed axis.
Now, the moment you arrange them in
this fashion, we observe that we have
various lattice points, cubicles,
grid elements, that pop up.
And we can think of arranging
them in various fashions.
So for example, if we look at slices.
For example, the xy slice, or
the x zed slice, or the y zed slice.
You get pairs of possibilities,
that every pair is an ordered pair.
One element followed by the other,
which tells you all the possibilities for
that slice.
Now there are three possible slices and
these give rise to three
Cartesian products.
The Cartesian products of A with B,
of A with C and B with C.
Now of course there's
one more possibility,
in order to triple of possibilities A,
B, C.
And this case,
now we've got all possibilities for
cutting and dicing these three alphabets.
Our question now is, how many ways
can we cut and dice in this fashion?
And our very basic elementary
principle of counting tells us
that the number of ways we can arrange
ordered pairs A and B is L times M.
It's just a multiplication
table of possibilities.
The number of ways we can arrange
ordered pairs A and C is L times N.
Again, it's an ordered
pair of possibilities.
And finally, the number of ways of getting
an ordered pair of possibilities B and
C is M times N.
How many ways are there of
getting an ordered triple?
Well naturally enough, each triple
corresponds to a lattice point
on a three-dimensional cube.
A lattice point, or
a grid point, this corresponds to each
of those cubicles you see in the figure.
And there are exactly L times
M times N such possibilities.
Very basic simple idea,
the fundamental property of counting
that independent possibilities multiply.
We can specify each element in a pair,
each element in a triple
independently of the other.
Now let's immediately
abstract this principal
into a formal definition
in a probabilistic sense.
Of course, as we've seen, when we're
dealing with combinatorial elements, then
this counting principal immediately gives
you a product rule for probabilities.
We will now abstract this to settings
where the probabilities are not
necessarily rational numbers but
could be generic real numbers.
And this gives us a rule of products.
Let's begin by looking at three events.
So we will say that three events
in some probability space,
creatively called A, B,
and C, are independent,
if and only if,
four relations are satisfied.
The first three relations talk about
a product rule for pairs of those three.
A with B, A with C, and B with C.
The last tells you a product rule for
all three of them together.
Independence is a rule of products.
And already, we say that the setting
is a little more complex than when we,
what we had for two events.
For two events, you only have one way
of combining them, A to section B.
But when you have three events,
you have many ways.
Now, in this case, exactly four ways
of looking at pairs or triples of them.
Now, before you go on,
the first three relations look familiar.
They correspond to independent
statements for pairs of events.
If the first three relations
are satisfied, then we will,
we shall say that the events A,
B and C are pairwise independent.
But pairwise independence,
as we shall see, does not, in general,
imply independence in the sense that
all four relations are satisfied.
