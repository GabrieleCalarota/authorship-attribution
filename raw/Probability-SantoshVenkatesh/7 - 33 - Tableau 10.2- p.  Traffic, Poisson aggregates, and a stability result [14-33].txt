This is a dangerous bend section and
can be sampled at your discretion.
We now turn our attention to
aggregates of Poisson variables.
The concentration here is that
of things like traffic and
we've all seen images of merging
traffic at high speed visually.
So you can see just traffic merging in and
forming a larger,
collective of a highway for example.
Similar kinds of phenomena occur on
the internet when we have traffic of
packets arriving at a router and
then they all routed, routed together and
sent on their way.
In such settings, our natural question is,
if one has independent streams coming
in and joining to form a collective,
what can one say about
the distribution of the merge streams?
This leads naturally to questions
of Poisson aggregates, so
let's start with simplest of the statics.
So, recall that a Poisson variable has
got a distribution and a parameter.
The parameter is fixed, let's say
it's lambda, and we have a particular
distributional form who support
e is on a non-negative integers.
Now let's start a very basic simple idea.
Suppose we have two traffic steams
merging and going the other way.
Suppose we look at the steams
over a certain period of time.
Let's say a minute,
an hour, what have you?
What can we say about the distribution of
the total traffic in that time period?
Naturally, in this kind of setting,
we are going to imagine that
the merging streams are independent.
Let's say we have X1 elements coming in,
in the first stream.
X2 in the second.
These could be cars, it could be people.
It could be packets to an internet router.
We can imagine that each of
these is a Poisson variable.
We're going to think of
them as arrivals and
then naturally enough a Poisson
distribution comes into play.
And of course, because if you have two
routes coming into a common center,
it is not necessary that the traffic
in those two routes will have to
have the same characteristics.
Or the same expected value.
So, let us say that X1 is a Poisson
variable with the parameter or
expectation lambda 1.
And X2, likewise, is a Poisson
variable independent of the first,
with a Poisson parameter or
expectation lambda 2.
Our question now is,
what can we say about a chance variable,
S obtained as a sum of X1 and X2?
This is the merge stream.
Of course, S is a chance variable which
takes non-negative integer values,
if we add to non-negative integers, you're
going to get a non-negative integer.
So naturally, the question is,
what can we say about the mass function
for the chance variable
S which is derived from
an underlying coordinate system
of variables, X1 and X2?
So naturally enough,
our first question then should be,
what is the sample space for this problem?
Well, clearly the chance
elements underlying this problem
are a pair of transvariables, X1 and X2.
And therefore, to completely specify
the experiment, all I have to do
is determine all pairs of
non-negative integers.
In other words, the sample space visually
is on the set of grid points, or
the lattice points, in the first
quadrant in a two dimensional space.
Every point in that grid,
in that lattice, is determined by
a pair of non-negative integers.
Say k1 and k2.
This now is our sample space.
Our next question of course is, well,
what is the probability measure?
Well, this is simple enough
because the atoms in
the space correspond to pairs
of variables, k1 and k2.
More di, diversely,
what this means is the sample point k1,
k2 arise is, if the first chance
variable X1 takes the value k1 and
the second chance variable
like takes the value k2.
But, we're given something
about this experiment,
X1 and X2 constitute independent trials.
And therefore,
we immediately have a rule of products.
The probability, then, is a product of
probabilities, one for X1, one for X2.
If we further presuppose that these
traffic streams are governed by Poisson
distributions, they're arrival processes.
And therefore, each of these
probabilities is a Poisson probability.
But we have to be careful here.
Now the parameters are becoming
relevant and important.
The first chance variable has a parameter
lambda 1, and therefore we're talking
about the probability of P of
k1 with a parameter lambda 1.
The second variable is Poisson
with parameter lambda 2 and so
we look at a probability P of k2 and
lambda 2 where the generic form for
a P of k of lambda is given on
the top left of your screen.
So far so good.
We've got the sample
space under control and
we've got the probability
measure under control.
What's next?
Naturally, the events of interest.
So what is the event of interest?
Clearly, we want to specify a mass
function for the sum S of X1 and X2.
The mass function, places mass on
non-negative integers k, k equal to 0,
1, 2, 3 and so forth.
For any given k therefore,
we're interested in the event,
that the sum is equal to k.
Of course in terms of my sample points,
these are all pairs of non-negative
integers for which the sum is exactly k.
But, the equation X1
plus X2 is equal to k,
connotes a line at negative
45 degrees on the plane.
For example, if k was 6, the line runs
through the following grid points.
0 comma 6, 1 comma 5,
2 comma 4, 3 comma 3,
4 comma 2, 5 comma 1, and 6 comma 0.
Of course, we quickly extrapolate for
a general value of k.
Then, the grid points for which the line,
X1 plus X2 is equal to k, runs through,
are exactly the values, 0, k, 1,
k minus 1, 2, k minus 2, and so forth.
Ending up with k, 0.
Of course, it'll be used for
the compact as in notation and
write that simply as,
if the sum is equal to k then the first
variable must take some
non-negative integer value say j.
But if the first variable takes the value
j, then the second variable must
take the value k minus j because
the sum of the two has to be exactly k.
And so here's a simple set theoretic
description of the event at hand.
Our next order of business, of course, is
to compute the probability of this event.
And then allow k to vary freely and now
we've let now with the mass function for
the sum of the two variables.
So let's go ahead and do this.
So here's our setting.
We want to begin by looking at the
probability that X1 plus X2 is equal to k.
We've discovered that is corresponds
to all the grid points or
lattice points on the line
X1 plus X2 is equal to k.
And so
there is exactly k plus 1 grid points.
0 comma k, 1 comma k,
minus 1 and so forth.
Additivity of probability measure
tells us that the probability of this
collection is the sum of
the atomic probabilities, and
let's involve summation notation
to simply our expression.
So for every pair j and
k minus j whose sum is of course exactly
k, we sum up the atomic probabilities.
This of course is merely
additivity of probability measure.
But for each of these atoms,
each of these pairs of integers,
we know we've got a product probability
because the individual variables, X1 and
X2, constitute independent trials.
And therefore,
we've got a probability for X1 of j,
a probability of k minus j for X2.
But we know something further.
Each of these probabilities
is a Poisson probability,
which has a particular functional form.
So our next step is to simply replace
each of these Poisson probabilities
by the explicit formulation
in terms of the Poisson.
Observe a parameter lambda 1 for the first
probability, a parameter lambda 2 for
the second probability.
At this point,
we've got a clear algebraic setting and
now all we have to do is simplify it.
Our first order of business is to make
the summation as clean as possible.
In other words,
let's pull out all the terms for
the sum that do not depend upon j.
In this case of course, we have
the two exponential which don't depend
upon the summation parameter j and we
just pull them right out of the equation.
Now, on the moment you do that,
what remains is something very simple.
You have an exponential,
collect the two exponentials together, and
then a summation over j running from 0
to k, of a fraction times two powers.
One involving lambda 1,
the other involving lambda 2.
Take a good hard look at the fraction.
Does that remind you of anything?
Has that perhaps a faint
atavistic tug on your memory?
Hm, perhaps you said, well, that looks
vaguely like a binomial coefficient
because you recall a binomial coefficient
has got two factorials in the denominator.
This looks a lot like it, of course, there
is a missing factorial in the numerator.
Well, let's see what
happens if we fill it in.
Suppose we multiply and divide our
expression on the right by k factorial.
Clearly, I've done no violence to
the expression because k factorial will
cancel.
Now let's take a look at
the fraction inside the summation.
And we realize, oh, this is exactly
the binomial coefficient k choose j.
Let's write that down.
There you go.
And now we got a simple expression and
not, even though there are these
strange parameters, lambda 2 and
lambda 1 floating around.
If you look at that
summation holistically,
you might be reminded of something.
Did you perchance realize that
that summation is exactly
the binomial expansion of lambda
1 plus lambda 2 to the power k?
In fact,
this is exactly the binomial theorem
when you take a power k of
the sum of two quantities.
Oh, this is elegant.
This is beautiful.
Now we've got a simple compact expression.
You see the summation has vanished.
And you've got a clean expression for
the mass function of the sum of
the two independent Poisson variables.
Does this look familiar?
And if you are looking at the top right
of your screen, of course it is familiar.
This is exactly in the Poisson form.
And in fact,
this is exactly a Poisson probability
whose parameter is lambda 1 plus lambda 2.
And there you go.
Of course, k is fixed but arbitrary.
It ranges over all
the non-negative integers.
And we've discovered a beautiful result.
We've added two Poisson
variables which are independent.
The first one with parameter lambda 1,
the second with parameter lambda 2.
The result is a Poisson variable.
The Poisson is stable
under such additions.
Whose parameter, whose expectation
is the sum of the individual
parameters lambda 1 and lambda 2.
But of course we cannot
promptly turn this.
What if we add a third stream in there?
Add an X3, and
independent Poisson variable with,
let's say, parameter lambda 3.
Well the sum of the first
two gives you a Poisson or
parameter lambda 1 plus lambda 2.
If you add that Poisson to a new Poisson,
you're going to get yet
another Poisson whose perimeters
are the sum of the three.
Lambda 1, lambda 2, lambda 3.
And proceeding in this fashion,
we've discovered a wonderful
stability property for the Poisson.
Formally, suppose X1,
X2, X3, through X sub n,
are independent Poisson variables, each
with a potentially different parameter.
Then the sum of these
variables is also Poisson.
And its parameter, its mean,
is a sum of the individual parameters.
A politically charged age demands
a mathematical slogan to capture
our identity, our stability.
Sums of independent Poisson
variables are also Poisson.
This key stability
observation fuels the lead
into time or spatially varying processes.
For example,
traffic on a highway or data net.
The distribution of
stars in the firmament.
And these lead, naturally,
to chance dependent phenomena,
which vary continuously with time or
space.
This is our next dangerous
bend optional segment.
