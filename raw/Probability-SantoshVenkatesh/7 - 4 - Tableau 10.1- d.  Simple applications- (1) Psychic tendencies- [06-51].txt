To settle concepts,
let us look at simple settings where
the binomial arises naturally.
To keep things firmly in view, we are
dealing with the toss of a metaphorical
coin whose success probability is p.
We're going to toss it repeatedly n times.
In other words,
we have a sequence of n Bernoulli trials.
We represent these
trials by x1 through xn.
We form the accumulated sum.
These will represent the accumulated
successes in these n trials.
We call that s sub n.
And we've discovered that s sub
n has got atomic probabilities
governed by the binomial distribution,
b of k, with parameters n,
the number of trials, and
p the success probability.
Our first example is whimsically titled,
lets call this psychic tendencies.
The problem at hand is the following.
Imagine that we have
a standard 52 card deck.
The experiment proceeds as follows.
A card is selected at
random from the deck.
You are asked to guess what the card is.
The card is replaced, and
a random new card is drawn.
You are asked again to
guess what that card is.
This is repeated ten times, and
you now have a sequence of ten guesses.
What is the chance that you guessed
two of the ten cards correctly?
What is the probability that you
got at least one guess right?
What does your intuition
say about the problem?
Do you think that either of these
probabilities is large, small, very small?
Now you already have enough
of a technical armory
to be able to set up a probability
space in this problem and analyze it.
Give it a go.
And when you're ready,
restart the lecture.
Well now that you're back, let's see
if we can put together a systematic
analysis of this problem in the framework
that we have developed so far.
The simplest way of thinking about
the accuracy of a guess is as follows.
There are 52 possible cards.
A card is randomly selected, and
therefore, you have a 1 in 52
chance of getting your guess right.
Since the cards are replaced, and
sampling is at replacement and
the new samples are independently drawn,
every guess forms an independent event.
In other words, we have a system
of repeated independent trials.
Each guess being right or
wrong, successful or
failed with probabilities 1 in 52 and
1 minus 1 in 52.
In other words, we are dealing with
a succession of 10 coin tosses,
10 Bernoulli trials whose
success probability is 1 in 52.
Success here, of course,
connotes that your guess was correct.
Let's promptly put in place
a mathematical structure around this.
The guesses are Bernoulli trials,
x1 through x10,
corresponding to the toss of a coin
whose success probability is 1 in 52.
The number of successful guesses is
the accumulated number of successes,
the sum s sub 10 of x1 through x10.
And of course, we know that now this
is governed by a binomial distribution,
corresponding to n equal to 10 trials,
and whose success probability
is p equal to 1 over 52.
And as in particular,
we can write down an atomic probability,
the probability that
S10 takes the value k.
In words, the probability that you
are successful with k out of your 10
guesses is exactly the binomial
probability on the right of the screen.
Now we are ready to handle the individual
problems that I pose on the left.
What is the probability that
you've got two guesses right?
Well, this is exactly the probability
that S10 is equal to 2.
We simply right down the binomial
probability, evaluate it,
a simple calculator will do it for you.
Or, if you're not feeling
particularly adventurous,
you can simply type in estimate
binomial probabilities or
a binomial calculator into
a search engine on a website.
And you can just type in these values and
out comes an answer.
Your chances for getting at least
two out of ten guesses right is
approximately 1.4%.
What about your chances of
getting at least one guess right.
Well, let's begin by writing it down.
The event at hand, of course, is
the probability that S10 is 1 or larger.
Is easiest to think of it
in terms of its complement.
Since S10 has to be some
value between 0 and
10, the event that S10 is at least 1,
together with a disjoint
event that S10 is 0.
In other words, we get no guess right,
is the entire sample space.
And therefore, by additivity, we can
relate the probability that S10 is bigger
than 1 to 1 minus
the probability that S10 is 0.
Now, we simply write the binomial
probability, evaluate it,
and out comes a clean and simple answer.
The probability that in ten guesses of,
of cards,
you get at least one right
is approximately 18%.
Now this is surprisingly
large if you think about it.
This says that one in five people making
guesses will guess at least one right.
Now if one really wanted to test
somebody's psychic abilities,
one would test their performance
against these binomial probabilities.
And deviation from these binomial
probabilities, of course,
would then be taken as evidence
of psychic behavior or perhaps,
more reasonably, evidence of a rigged
game where the cards are rigged.
