Now let's formulate a simple problem
in the throwing of two dice.
Two dice are thrown.
Now we're told that the sum of the face
values of the two dice is eight.
What now is the chance that at least
one of the two dice shows an ace?
Now this perhaps is not quite so
intuitive.
And maybe it is not so easy now to arise
or jump at quickly at the wrong answer.
But if you like, pause for a moment and
think about it, and see if you
have an instinctive feel, an intuitive
feel for what the answer might be.
Start the lecture again when you're ready.
Now, albeit in the immediate intuition for
the problem.
We should start again by constructing
a probability space for it, and
we should begin with a sample space.
Now we have seen this sample space
before in Tablo three, part three.
When we talked about
the dice game of craps.
Now in this setting,
the sample space is naturally
obtained by identifying the results for
each die in turn.
Say, die one and die two.
The sample space then becomes a system
of ordered pairs of integers,
where the elements run from one through
six, the possible faces for the die.
The sample space has got
36 possible outcomes.
Six possibilities for the first die,
six possibilities for the second die.
In this space, what are the subsets that
give rise to the events of interest?
Again let's color code these subsets.
Let A denote the event of interest,
which is,
that at least one of
the two dies shows an ace.
Now we think about this for a moment, and
we can identify precisely those pairs for
which one of the two elements are n,
j, show six.
And we can enumerate
them very systematically.
For example the first die shows a six.
And then the second die can show any
of the numbers from one through six.
Now or, the second die so,
shows a six, and
now the first die can show any of
the numbers from one through five.
And there are now 11 possibilities in
total, and these comprise the event A.
What about the side information
that we are told about
the outcome of the experiment?
Well we're told that the sum
of the face values is eight.
Notice we're not told what the outcome is.
We're not told what each of
the two dies are showing.
what we are told is that this,
whatever the outcome is it
falls into this category.
This is the information we have.
Now the sum of the two
face values being eight,
will constrain the possible
pairs to five in number.
Six and two, five and
three, four and four.
Three five, or two and six.
There are exactly five possibilities and
no more.
Now the two events at hand are clear,
we now need a probability measure.
And again, the natural probability
measure here is combinatorial.
The, we have a discrete setting, a finite
setting with 36 possible outcomes, and
naturally enough.
We assign an equal atomic probability,
a one in 36 to each of
these 36 possibilities.
The other probabilities are by the peel
to additivity obtained by simply
adding up the atomic probabilities in
each of these events, since A has got.
Eleven sample points in it.
The chance of A is now 11/36.
And since B has got five sample points
in it, the chance of B is now 5/36.
Again a visual picture might
drive this abstraction home.
We can depict the sample space in
a six by six array of numbers.
This is omega.
There are 36 elements.
Each square
here represents one possible outcome.
The event A of interest to us,
where there's at least 1- 6,
is obtained as the band around
the edge in red, shown in the figure.
The chance of A, then is,
naturally enough, 11 out of 36.
This is the unvarnished chance
that you get at least one ace,
when you're told nothing else about
the outcome of the experiment.
But wait, we're told something
about the nature of the outcome.
We are told that the sum of
the face values is eight.
The event B is obtained as those five
squares along a diagonal in your figure.
Once you're told that B occurs, none of
the other elements could have occurred.
We're expunged from the 36 possibilities,
31 possibilities.
The sample space has now been
reduced effectively to just B alone.
And in this new sample space,
we have five possibilities,
and of these possibilities,
precisely two trigger A.
The possibility, the first die shows six,
and the second die shows two.
And the possibility that the fire
die shows two and the second die
shows six again, highlighted
with red borders in your figure.
Now once you're told that they'll
be a this is the entirety of a new
sample space.
To normalize it properly,
we had to ask ourselves now not just
what are the chance of A among the
universe of original possibilities, but
what is the chance of A among the reduced
possibilities that constitute B?
The chance of A now,
given that B occurs, and therefore
we come to the conclusion that given
that the sum of face values is eight.
The chance of observing
an ace at least one ace
on the two faces must
inevitably be two and five.
These simple chance experiments
in very commonplace settings,
oddly allow us to identify
the key elements of how we wish
to fold side information formally
into the abstraction process.
For our purposes now,
side information is always provided.
When it is the present,
in the form of an ancillary event.
The moment we specify an ancillary event,
the question then is how does a target
event, in this case a,
interact with the ancillary event b?
Ineluctably, they are twinned together and
in this twinning arises a conditioning
of factoring inside information.
So this is the basis of the formal
definition that will arise next.
