So, let us start today
with the idea of families.
Now, we understand the families
can have various sizes,
and of course, the chance-driven
element in these ideas is
the question of the gender
of the children.
And let's start with a very sanitized and
simple problem.
Say a family has two children.
It is known that one of
the two children is a boy.
What are the chances that
the other child is a boy?
Pause and think about this for
a moment, and see whether you come
up with an instinctive answer.
Was it perhaps one half?
Now, if you came up with such an answer,
this is entirely reasonable.
It is based upon a vague
presumption that the genders
of children are independent,
whatever that means,
and that the two sexes are equally likely.
And therefore,
if you're told that one child is a boy,
then the gender of that child does not,
in our intuitive understanding,
affect the gender of the other child, and
since then, both sexes are equally likely
of occurrence, then the chance of
that child being a boy is one in two.
This sounds really reasonable, but
before we accept this as
an accurate answer, we should pause
and think about this in terms of
the abstract formulation that we built up.
What is the probability
space under consideration?
What is the sample space of outcomes?
What are the events of interest?
And, what does the probability measure?
Before we come to a right understanding of
what this particular question is asking.
So, let us start with a sample space.
What is a space of idealized
outcomes of this experiment?
Well, it is natural to write down each
sample point, or idealized outcome,
of the experiment by listing
the genders of the two children by age,
older child first, younger child next.
To use B for boy, G for girl, and
using a gothic font to distinguish
it from ordinary letters,
we find the sample space has got four
outcomes in it, four sample points.
The sample points are BB older boy, and
younger boy, BG older boy,
younger girl, GB and GG.
What now, are the events of interest
in this particular structure?
Recall that events are subsets
of the sample space.
Now, we are interested in the other
child being a boy, and therefore
the native event of interest to us is
the event that both children are boys.
Let us call this event A.
Now, there's only one sample
point which will trigger A, and
that sample point is when
both children are boys.
In other words, it's B, B.
And therefore A, the event of interest,
is comprised of a single atomic event,
a singleton,
a set consisting of one sample point.
Lurking in the background, and this is the
information we're given about the problem,
is another event,
the event that there is a boy.
Or more accurately,
there is at least one boy.
Now, if you take a look at this in a hard,
cold light, what this says is,
this excludes the possibility
that both children are girls.
And if we remove that particular
sample point from the sample space,
then the remaining three sample points
are all triggers for this event.
Let's us call it B.
That at least one child is a boy,
and therefore,
B is comprised of the sample points BB,
BG, and GB.
Excellent.
We've got two elements of the probability
space under control, the sample space and
the events of interest.
We now have to come to a probability
measure, and naturally enough,
we have a discrete setting,
in fact, a finite setting.
It's suffices to provide an atomic
probability, a probability for
each atom, each singleton set.
And in this very natural setting,
in this very sanitized setting,
it is natural to assume that all
atoms have got equal probability.
To assign equal probability mass
to each of the atomic sets,
consisting of BB alone, BG alone,
GB alone, and GG alone.
The moment we have these
atomic probabilities,
we can construct the probability for
any set whatsoever,
by simply adding up the probabilities
of the constituent atoms.
Because this is combinatorial setting,
the resulting probabilities are going to
depend only upon the number
of elements in your sets, and
not on what the precise elements are.
And therefore, the probability of
the event A, that both children are boys,
is simply 1 in 4, and
the probability of the event B,
that there is at least one
boy in the family is 3 in 4.
A picture can sometimes help to make these
abstract concepts a little more vivid.
So, suppose we write down
the four elements in the sample space in
this tilized picture that I've shown you,
color coded to help us notice
what the various elements are.
I'm using red for the event A and
green subsumed within the red in
the case of BB for the event B,
that there's at least one boy.
This now is a sample space.
In this sample space,
the chance of A occurring
because it is a combinatorial setting,
is naturally 1 in 4.
This is the unvarnished
probability of A without
any side information about
the process at hand.
But wait, we are not told something
about the outcome of the experiment.
We're told something about
the family that is being observed.
We are told that this particular
family has at least one boy.
This means that in the sample
space that we started with,
the sample point consisting of two
girls is eschewed, is removed.
It is as if the sample space was
simplified by the expulsion,
by expunging certain
elements of the space.
This is what the information
on the side is providing us.
It has reduced the space of possibilities.
We now have three possibilities.
It's as if our sample space
has become this new event, B.
Now, given that B has occurred,
we know now that only one of three
possible outcomes can have occurred.
And now we ask,
what is the chance that A occurs?
What is the chance
the other child is a boy?
What is the chance that
both children are boys,
given that there is at least one boy?
This naturally resides at
the intersection of these two events.
The chance there are two boys and
that there is at least one boy,
is precisely the event
that there are two boys.
The event A, in this case,
happens to be contained in,
it's a subset of the event B.
Naturally enough,
the space of possibilities is reduced.
Instead of four, we now have three.
All of them happen to have equal chance,
and therefore,
the probability of observing
that the other child is a boy,
given that there is at least one boy,
is a ratio of these two.
It is a proportional part of a that
lies in B, colloquially speaking.
And therefore the chance we will ascribe,
naturally,
is 1 in 3, not 1 in 2 as we
might naively have presumed.
Here, now,
is an example in a very simple setting
of how side information can
modulate underlying chances.
A chance, a native chance, or 1 in 2,
has now become a chance of 1 in 3.
Let's take a look at a slightly more
complex example to drive home this point,
and let us return to enter
the old standby, dice.
