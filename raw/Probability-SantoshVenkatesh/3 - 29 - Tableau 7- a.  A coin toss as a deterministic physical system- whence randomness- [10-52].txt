Tableau 7.
Is the outcome of the toss
of a coin really random?
Thus far in our development of
an abstract theory of probability,
we have appealed to intuition from
commonplace chance experiments,
to put together a foundation
consisting of three elements.
First, an abstract sample
space of idealized
outcomes of a thought experiment,
a experiment.
These are the sample
points of the experiment.
Second an algebra of events.
And third, a probability measure a set
function which ascribes to events,
numbers, in accordance with
three fundamental axioms.
The axiom of positivity,
the axiom of normalization,
and most importantly,
the axiom of additivity.
So far, so good.
We've now got the beginnings
of an abstract
fully mathematical theory of chance.
But, how does such an abstract theory
gel with our common experience?
How does it fit with
commonplace chance experiments?
Inevitably we go back to
the simplest settings
to get a right understanding of
how theory measures with practice.
And the simplest of all,
of course, is the toss of a coin.
And so, inevitably we return
to the toss of a coin.
Let us consider what is
involved in the toss of a coin.
We hold a coin up with some orientation,
we toss it, it lands,
and perhaps it bounces.
At this stage, one discerns that
the process is purely mechanical.
This is a physical experiment
governed by physical laws.
What are the kinds of laws which govern
where the coin actually ends up, and
what it's final orientation is?
Well, one can think about it and
say, well,
the mass distribution surely should
have some effect on the coin.
So how is material distributed on and
around the coin?
The resistance of the air
might play a part.
The gravitational force,
which, could depend upon the altitude
at which this experiment is conducted.
Is it conducted at high altitude?
Is it conducted at sea level?
The elasticity of the floor which
governs the number of bounces,
if the coin is allowed to bounce.
And of course, the initial velocity
with which the coin leaves the fingers,
and the spin or
the angular velocity imparted to it.
So these,
one could discern are primary factors,
effecting how the coin moves,
how it evolves, and how it ends up.
But the moral of the story is that a coin
toss is properly viewed as a fully
deterministic, evolving,
dynamical, physical system.
And if it's a purely deterministic system,
it is governed by physical laws.
And in consequence,
the outcome should be predictable.
Well before we launch
into an analysis of this,
it is always wise to simplify
the problem to essentials.
If one looks at the situation as a whole,
there are several factors which could
conceivably affect the experiment.
But not all of them are of
primary importance.
For example, the listener might well agree
that the distribution of a normal
coin is reasonably uniform.
Yes, there is a head embessed, embossed on
one side and there's a tail on the other.
But these are minor variations in
the thickness of the coin, and at least,
your first approximation,
it might be not unreasonable to imagine
the coin has got a uniform mass density.
Likewise, the air resistance, one might
pose it that over a relatively short
distance of transit the air resistance
is not significant, not primary.
Similarly, the gravitational force,
well we could just suppose that we
do the experiment at ground level.
But wherever it is we can assume,
again to first approximation that
the gravitational force, the gravitational
acceleration does not vary significantly
over the duration of the coin toss,
over the height of the actual coin toss.
Floor elasticity creates
a variation on this theme.
And we can eliminate it
again from consideration for
first principles by simply
saying we just catch the coin.
And at this point we don't have
to worry about repeated bounces.
Now if this is the case, then many
of these factors become secondary.
But of course it is very hard
to get away from the conclusion
that two factors are primary and
will affect the outcome.
The first, the initial velocity,
how fast is the coin moving?
What speed is imparted to it
by the flick of your fingers?
And the second, the angular velocity.
How fast is it turning when
it leaves your fingers?
So it appears that there are two
fundamental physical parameters
which affect the outcome of a coin toss,
at least to a first analysis.
So now let us consider how these
two elements come into play and
how they interact.
So let's go back now to
a sanitised model of a coin toss.
Here now we have a coin and
we are going to toss it, and
we will simplify the experiment by
assuming that we toss it and we catch it.
It'll simplify the analysis
if we assume that
we catch the coin at the same
height that we tossed it at.
This is not essential for the analysis but
it'll make the algebra
a little more transparent.
Nothing is wise that unnecessarily
complicates existence and
therefore without further ado,
here is a sanitized model of a coin toss.
We begin by imagining that the real
coin is modeled by a thin uniform disk.
One side labeled heads, the other labeled
tails, as depicted in your figure.
Now, at time zero for the experiment,
we imagine the coin is placed flat at
a certain height above the ground and
we will call that the origin of
a coordinate system, height zero.
Now this is a matter of definition.
So let's say that this is now
at height zero, at time 0.
T, inevitably, will denote time.
And now there are two
parameters of interest to us.
One is, how high is the coin at a certain
time from my starting position?
And, how much has it rotated
from my initial position?
Now there's one more parameter which can
add an element of chance to this and
let's dispose of that, and that is
the initial orientation of the coin.
Let us say that we start
with heads facing upwards.
So now we've got an experiment.
A coin at height zero, at time zero,
with heads point upwards, is tossed.
It is caught at the same height,
a certain speed, a velocity v,
is imparted to the coin and we assume the
coin is now travelling straight upwards.
Inevitably we call the height
the letter y, because
long experience with the calculus has
inured us to calling the vertical axis y.
So let's call the height y.
And for similar reasons the angle that
the coin makes with the horizontal.
So the moment we impart
a flip to the coin,
the coin is revolving
around a horizontal axis.
The angle it makes with that axis
we shall call inevitably, theta.
So y represents height, theta, the angle
the coin makes with the horizontal.
Of course both of these
are function of time.
At time zero, in the initial position
with heads pointing upwards,
the height y at time zero is zero.
The angle at time zero is zero.
So we say, y of zero is zero,
and theta of zero is zero.
Now the coin is tossed.
Let us consider what happens at time t.
The coin is at a certain height,
let's say, y at time t.
And with a certain angular orientation,
theta at time t.
As the coin progresses and
comes back down,
we catch it at the same height that
we had caught the coin earlier.
Its termination time, when we catch the
coin, let's say is a time t equal to tau.
And at time tau, the coin is
returned to its original position.
Its height is now zero again.
And when its height is zero,
its angle however,
is not quite zero, not necessarily.
So at time tau, it forms some angle theta
of tau with respect to the horizontal.
The hand of course absorbs the force
of the returning coin, and the coin
is then kept flat with the upward
pointing face at the moment
it returns to its starting point, the
ultimate outcome of the toss of the coin.
So at this point we've got a coin which
has returned, its angle at time tau,
the termination of experiment
is theta of tau, and
the angle determines everything about
what the outcome is going to be.
