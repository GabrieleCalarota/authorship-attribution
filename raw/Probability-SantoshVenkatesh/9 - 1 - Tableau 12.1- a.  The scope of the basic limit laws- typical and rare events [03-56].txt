Tableau 12.
A potpourri of titillating applications.
And so,
we are come to the end of our repast.
But, even the most filling of
meals deserves a delicate dessert,
and so I'm going to give
you a dessert of provoking,
titillating, curious applications.
This is a dangerous bend lecture,
and so this tableau is intended for
those who have the fortitude
to brave perhaps other
dangerous bend tableaux.
The mathematical content
here is not excessive.
I will hide much of the detail.
But the applications you might
well find are persuasive and
tempting, and so this is optional.
And for those who want to indulge
in this dessert, carry on.
We shall see an application
in the art of making money
in optimal stock portfolio selection.
We shall discuss the curious case
of Sir Cyril Burt, psychologist.
And we will conclude with what was
apparently a serendipitous discovery
in the theory of rare events,
leading to a beautiful and
ubiquitous probabilistic sieve.
Before we start with our applications,
let us recapitulate the key idea
behind the fabulous limit laws which were
the crowning point of our development.
The limit laws in essence
described typical behavior.
This was engendered by sums
of independent variables.
And it led to a notion of centrality,
a notion of concentration.
This is what typically happens.
And we've seen how the behavior around
that typical center was governed,
loosely speaking, by a bell curve,
a normal distribution.
But along the way,
we also made a serendipitous discovery
in the theory of rare events.
And this was in tableau ten,
part two where we saw that the binomial
distribution in the context
of rare successes devolved
into a beautiful approximation,
the Poisson approximation.
That looked serendipitous.
It looked accidental.
It handled rarity.
But this accidental discovery fuels
an entire theory of exceedances and
rare events, and this is governed
by the Poisson distribution.
So our discoveries today
our direction in today's lecture
will be in two portions.
On one hand, we'll consider typicality and
two beautiful and
subtle applications where concentration,
the law of large numbers,
and the central limit
theorem come into play.
And we look at a bevy of applications
at the other end of the spectrum,
where things are atypical,
where things are rare, and
now we will find that the Poisson
distribution comes into play.
And in the context of a beautiful,
remarkable, ubiquitous,
probabilistic sieve.
