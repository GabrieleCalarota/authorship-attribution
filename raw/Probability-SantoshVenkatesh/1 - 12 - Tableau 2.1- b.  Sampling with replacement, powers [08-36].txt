Our next order of business
is asking how many
different ways we can sample
under various conditions.
Let's start with a very simple and
elementary problem.
This is part of a genre of problems
called ball and urn problems.
The language is archaic.
And who uses urns anymore?
Except perhaps in funerary circumstances.
But it is traditional and
we will continue to use it.
So for us an urn is a receptacle,
a box, a cell.
You would imagine that these
are metaphorical urns, metaphorical boxes,
they are infinitely distensible, they can,
you can put in as many elements
as you want inside them.
Right?
So they are not limited in capacity,
now, now consider a setting like this.
Suppose we have three balls,
I have indicated them for you in colors.
A peach colored ball.
A green ball and a purple ball.
And five urns.
The urns and the balls are considered
implicitly to be distinguishable.
For example, the balls are clearly given,
you have three different colors.
Or they could have the numbers one,
two, and three on them.
Something like a snooker or
a billiard ball setting.
The runs likewise,
are considered to be distinguishable, and
I've indicated this by giving them
numbers one, two, three, four, five.
Now, here's a question,
how many ways can I put these
three balls into these five urns?
So, here are possible examples.
So the peach colored ball could
fly over and land in urn 2.
The green ball could decide to
fly all the way over to urn 5.
And the purple ball perhaps also
decides to go land in urn 2.
When you think about this,
if you want to describe the experiment.
All you do,
you have to do to tell me is tell me
where did the peach colored ball lie?
Where did the green ball lie?
And where did the purple ball lie?
Now ahead of time, we agree on a covenant.
We decide on a mode of interaction and
operation.
We decide on a dictionary of translation.
For how we describe things.
So you could tell me that I'm
going to tell you first where
the peach-colored ball goes, and
then where the green-colored ball goes,
and then where the purple ball goes.
Now, the moment you do that,
you can compact all of this
by giving me three numbers.
The urn order, the urn numbers,
where these balls in this order, peach,
green, purple, have ended up.
And so, in this particular example, all
you'd have to do is give me 2, 5 and 2.
And that describes completely
the experiment for me.
Now let's step back and abstract this and
try to understand how this
would work in general.
The idea now is I've
abstracted the urn and
ball metaphor and said here's what we do.
Let's decide on a priori order for
the balls.
In our case, peach, green, purple.
And then simply specify
a triple of numbers in order,
representing which urns
these balls landed up in.
Here is an abstraction.
The balls are specified
in a particular order.
Remember, the balls are distinguishable
by color, by number, or otherwise.
And where they have landed up
gives me a triple of numbers.
In our case 2, 5, 2.
In general specify three numbers,
three indices.
Let's call them j1, j2, and j3.
These three indices
are numbers between 1 and 5.
And represent, one at a time, where
each of these three balls have landed.
Lovely.
Now, we have some abstraction.
From here, suppose we ask, how many ways
can you specify these three numbers?
Notice already, the moment we have
compacted the notation like this,.
Certain modes, or directions of
thought are becoming clearer.
It is much harder, when we're
dealing with balls, and urns, and
things are moving around.
But the moment we have
abstracted the essence,
the mathematical essence of what was
going on, the problem has simplified.
There is now a route to solution.
Let's think about this.
The first number, J1, representing
where the peach ball has gone,
could be any one of five possibilities.
Beautiful, let's hold on to that.
The second number, j2, representing
where the green ball has gone,
has also five different possibilities.
Nothing is precluded, remember
the urns are infinitely distensible,
you can put in as many
balls as you want and
nothing the problem statement prevents you
from using an urn you have used before.
So there are five distinct
possibilities for j2.
And likewise there are five distinct
possibilities for j3 for the purple ball.
Now an elementary principle of counting,
which you all have learned
in kindergarten, perhaps.
Maybe in second or third grade,
or perhaps in fifth grade.
Is that independent
possibilities multiply.
This is the essence of
a multiplication table.
And therefore, the number of ways
in which you can specify, and
order triple like this, is exactly.
5 times 5 times 5.
Of course, this is 125.
But we will ordinarily not worry
about simplifying such numbers.
The logic behind the calculation, for
our purposes, is much more
important than the final answer.
So the idea here is that the number
of urns multiplies three times.
Of course from very early on in school we
have a short compact notation for this.
We call it 5 to the power 3 or 5 cubed.
This is a power notation with
which we are very familiar.
So at end what have we concluded?
So in fine there are.
5 to the power 3 distinct
ways in which three
distinguishable balls can be distributed
into five distinguishable urns.
Once we've understood the basic principle,
we very quickly abstract out and
try to find a general answer.
So, let's put in some notation.
It's going to look a little
formidable at first sight,
but if you keep this example in mind,
it'll become transparent.
So, here is the question.
Suppose I start with
a population with n elements.
a1 through an enclosed enclosed in
curly brackets because it is a set,
the order does not matter.
Suppose I select from this population
an ordered sample of size K.
I'm selecting three urns out of the five
to place my three balls in some order.
I'm selecting K earns out of my n
to place my K balls in some order.
How many different ways
can I specify this?
How many different ordered samples
of size k are there when sampling is
with replacement from an underlying
finite population of size n?
That is, that's a lot of verbiage.
But the mathematical notation compacts all
of that through our, this dictionary of
translation, into something very simple
and susceptible of easy analysis.
And analysis is exactly
the same as before.
The first number, the first urn from
the first ball can be specified in n ways.
The second urn for the second ball,
can be specified independently in n ways.
Similarly, n for
the third and n for the kth.
Independent possibilities multiply, and
therefore there are n times n times n,
k times number of ways in which we can
specify an ordered sample of size k,
when sampling is with replacement.
And of course.
In our usual notation,
we call this n to power k.
