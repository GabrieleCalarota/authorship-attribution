Tableau two, part two,
Basic properties of binomial coefficients.
[MUSIC]
Now,
you might have wondered when you saw
our definition of binomial coefficient,
that this wasn't quite the form
that you saw it in high school.
It is useful for such an elementary,
and important object to look at it from
several different vantage points, and
to discover structure and properties.
So this is what our tableau
is going to be about.
So we begin with an alternative form for
the falling factorial.
The motivation here is that a falling
factorial is a key component
in the definition of
the binomial coefficient.
And therefore, it behooves us to look
at it a little bit more carefully
to understand its mathematical structure.
Accordingly, let's begin
with n to the k falling.
Recall that this stands for
the number of distinct
ordered samples of size k
that we can engender from
an underlying population of size n when
the sampling is without replacement.
Now, by definition,
this gives you a product of k
successive tabs starting at n.
Each term one less than the previous one.
Excellent.
We call this the falling factorial.
Now, it looks like a factorial, but
of course it is not quite a factorial.
So, what if we go ahead and
complete the missing terms?
Now the terms that are missing are the
expressions n minus k, n minus k minus 1,
n minus k minus 2, and so forth,
all the way down to 2 and 1.
If you multiply all of
these in the numerator,
we will get a bonafide factorial.
But we can't simply multiply numbers,
can we?
We're going to have to properly normalize
by dividing by the same quantity,
to keep our identity honest.
So let's write down the next step.
We simply put in all the terms that
are missing from 1 till n minus k,
in the numerator and in the denominator.
Pause for a bit and write it down.
Remember, learning mathematics is
an intrinsically tactile endeavor.
You write, you think,
you pause, you think again.
Write, think, read,
in the words of Alain Touraine.
Now, when you're ready,
restart the lecture.
Now, as you progress, what do you say?
Well, in the numerator,
we've got a factorial.
We got all the terms from 1 till n.
Of course, that gives us n factorial.
In the denominator, we have all
the terms from 1 through n minus k.
We have n minus k factorial.
And now, we've discovered an identity.
n to the k falling is nothing more than n
factorial divided by n minus k factorial.
Excellent.
Let us quickly test our understanding.
Evaluate, express n to the n
minus k falling in terms of factorials.
Pause the lecture,
see if you can work it through.
Restart when you are ready.
Okay.
Now, we're back.
n to the n minus k falling
is a falling factorial.
And therefore, if in the previous
expression we replace k by n minus k,
we will get an identity.
All this is easy,
let's go ahead and do this.
n to the n minus k falling,
then is n factorial?
And in the denominator, you subtract n
minus k from n and take its factorial.
Or in other words,
you get n factorial over k factorial.
Excellent.
Now, we got, come into a right
understanding of what exactly this falling
factorial is, and
where the factorials come into play.
Now, let's leverage this understanding and
move on to the binomial coefficient.
