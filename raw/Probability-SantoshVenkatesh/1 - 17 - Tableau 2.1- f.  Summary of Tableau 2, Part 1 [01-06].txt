So, at this point,
let's take stock, right?
So what have we done?
We figured out that from
a finite population,
sampling can be done in three
distinguished kinds of ways,
ordered samples, which can be in two
flavors, with and without replacement, and
subpopulations, where
the order does not matter.
To summarize, if we have a finite
set of population of size n and
we generate a sample of
size k from that set,
if the sample is ordered and
sampling is with replacement,
then there are n to the power k different
ways we can generate such a sample.
If sampling is without replacement,
then there are n to the k falling
ways of generating such a sample.
And if one is interested
in a subpopulation,
then there are exactly n choose k ways
of engendering such a subpopulation.
