Here is a recurrence.
We have a, a recurrence for P of n and m,
in terms of P of n minus 1 and
m, and P of n and m minus 1.
We have certain boundary conditions.
Now,.
This gives us a two-dimensional
array of values P and n.
The boundaries are specified for us.
So here's what we have.
Axes n and m, starting at the origin and
increasing through positive integers.
The boundary conditions tell us that
along the Y axis, the probabilities
are 0 because M exceeds N.
Along the X axis, for positive N,
the probability is 1 because if Bob
gets no good, Jane always leads.
And in fact, everywhere along a diagonal,
a 45 degree diagonal,
the probabilities are 0.
So everything at a diagonal and above,
you have 0 probability, all right.
These are what the boundary
conditions give us.
Now what about the rest of the values,
okay?
Of course,
this is the million dollar question.
So what if n is 6 and m is 4?
We want P of 6, 4.
This was our original problem.
Or modify problem.
What if n is 51 and m is 49?
Well that's somewhere in
the wedge out there, and
that's what we want to determine.
What does a recurrence tell us?
The recurrence tells us that if we want
to look at a particular n and m value.
The probability of Pn,m is determined
by two other probabilities.
A P value directly below it
corresponding to N and M minus 1.
A P value to is left
corresponding to n minus 1 and m.
If I know these two p values,
call them earlier p values.
Together, they allow us to deduce
our target's p value through a.
Process of aggregation, okay.
This means that we build up everything
in that wedge via this recurrence.
Well, let's build up some idea of
how we're going to do this, right.
So let's start with
the simplest non-trivial case.
Let's look at the case where n is 2 and
m is 1.
That's the little grey
triangle we're looking at.
The values south of and
west of the desired value 2,1
will inform the value at 2,1.
Let's put it together.
Well, we know the values to the south and
to the west.
They are given by the boundary conditions.
Throw them into in a relationship,
and out comes an answer, oh beautiful.
Now, the chance of Jane leading Bob,
every step of the way,
when she gets two votes and
Bob gets one vote is 1 in 3.
Now this is so simple that you can
work out all possible arrangements and
verify this for yourself.
Oh, very good.
Well, what about the next step?
Well what can we say if Jane gets
three votes and Bob gets one vote?
Well, we build up it again from
the point south and west of 3 comma 1.
South of 3,1 is a value.
3,0, which is certain.
Worst of 3,1 is a value
corresponding to 2,1, but
we've just calculated this probability.
We plug it in.
We evaluate it and we find it's 2 and 4.
Curious error, curious error,
as Alice remarked.
If we look at the next value,
n is 4 and Bob is 1, and, and n is 1.
Again, the values south and west of these
values will inform the target value,
we plug it in and we find it's 3 and 5.
This looks quite beguiling.
In fact, as you progress along the line,
n equal to 1.
It looks like the probabilities are
increasing like n minus 1 over n plus 1.
That's very interesting.
Now let's try a different value for
m, say m equal to 2.
What if n is 3 and m is 2?
Again, the point south.
Is n is 3 and m is 1.
Oh, but we know this value.
The point to the west is n is 2 and
m is 2.
Oh, but we know this value as well.
Plug it in and
we now have a new probability, 1 in 5.
What about the point 4,2?
Jane gets four votes, Bob gets two votes.
Pro, go through the same process,
we now find it's 2 and 6.
Now we can see,
we have a systematic process.
We can populate for
any n value, all values for n.
Then we keep doing this until we
fill up everything in the wedge,
going out as far as we need to.
And if we do that,
we end up with this array of values.
At least at this level we have a numerical
method of getting to any n, m value.
In particular, we can read off.
The probability P of 6,4
in your screen will tell
you 6,4 has a chance of 2 in 10 or 1 in 5.
There's a 20% chance that
in the original problem,
Jane will lead Bob every step of the way.
She gets six votes, Bob gets four votes.
What about 51,49?
Well we could, have to far enough along
this wedge until we get to 51,49 but
it would be nice wouldn't it, if we had an
explicit formula for what P of n and m is.
Now if you look at this and
stare at it long enough,
you will see a pattern emerging.
Okay?
And the pattern gives you a conjecture for
what the answer might be.
P of n, m appears to take a particularly
simple and beguiling form.
The ratio of n minus m to n
plus m when n is bigger than m.
Of course,
one shouldn't believe a formula just
because it appears on screen or in a book.
Right?
One should verify it
to make sure we believe the structure.
So, let's take a look at
how we might verify this.
Here is a projected, a putative answer.
P of n,m is n minus m over n plus m.
And there's a recurrence.
The Pof n,m needs to satisfy.
To verify it,
let us see if the left hand side is in
fact, equal to the right hand side.
On the left, I have n and m in play.
On the right, I have two terms,
one involving n minus 1 and
m and one involving n and m minus 1.
If our formula is valid,
we plug in and we get fractions.
Simplify and verify we have
an identity and we do have a solution.
And a particularly simple and
elegant one at that.
If in a two party election,
one candidate gets n votes and
the other gets m votes and
n is bigger than m.
The chance of the winning
candidate leading
at every step of the way
is n minus m over n plus m.
We could hardly have hoped for
a simpler or cleaner answer.
And against the odds,
out of this very complicated looking
structure emerges a rose of an answer.
A beautiful, elegant answer.
What about the case when Jane got 51% of
the vote and Bob got 49% of the vote?
Notice, as long as Jane gets 51% and
Bob gets 49%,.
The actual numbers n and m don't matter.
It's only their relative
proportions that matter and
so whatever the size of the population.
Imagine let's say a vote
in the US state of Florida
would say approximately 6 million voters.
If Jane gets 51% of the vote and
Bob gets 49% of the vote,
well it's a very large number.
Jane and Bob Bob are both getting
approximately 3 million votes apiece.
The chance of Jane leading every
step of the way is in fact
51 minus 49 divided by 51 plus 49.
Or in other words,
there is fully a 2% chance.
That Jane leads Bob every step of the way.
Chance in commonplace settings tends to
mean different things to different people.
So, at some level, people might look at
2% and say, well, that's a small number.
But if you think of it in
the context of 6 million voters.
Each of the candidates getting
approximately half the votes,
votes are in random order,
that one candidate actually led
the other candidate every step of the way,
that seems to feel unnatural,
it doesn't feel right, all right.
Or to put it into context,
if in 50 states in a country.
The 50 states of the United States for
example.
You had contentious
elections where one party
led the other by 51 to 49
in each of the 50 states.
In many other states of course,
the running count would go all,
all directions,
one party ultimately triumphing.
But, on average in one
out of those 50 states,
perhaps the unhappy state of Florida,
you might have a candidate leading
over 6 million counted votes where
she gets half of them approximately.
She leads at every step of the way, for
many people you might find this is.
Okay and
this is again illustrative of the fact,
that chance has got unexpected
wells of possibility.
Places where intuition is not sufficient
to get at the underlying ground to truth.
For our purposes here, this example,
the ballot problem of WA where to add.
Illustrates how additivity and
conditioning on a carefully chosen
ancillary event can unlock an apparently
intractable and difficult problem.
Subtle and nuanced, right.
The difficulty was not in
the utilization of the formula.
The formula is as simple as can be.
It's just a chain of
conditional probabilities.
The difficulty in this
problem is identifying
the appropriate underlying
answer of the event.
Which, partitions of space and
peels out what the individuals pieces are.
This problem is not just for fun.
It's not just for
illustrative purposes but
it turns out to have deep consequences.
Right?
A, an eventual descendant
of this line of thought
leads to questions about
where random walks move.
They lead to questions in what
is now called Martingale theory.
And the understanding of
simple problems like this
leads then to profound new results
in new directions of endeavor.
