Our first application deals
with the art of making money.
How does one make money?
Well, a facetious answer might be,
well print it.
Of course, there are a couple
of objections to that score,
that tends to earn us a long stretch
under the hospitality of the government.
As long as I'm being facetious, what is
the difference between the government
printing money and
an individual printing money?
In the former case, it's called economics.
In the latter case it's called fraud,
but we are being facetious.
Of course the setting here is,
how should one
invest in a stock market?
What governs the growth or
wealth in a stock market?
Of course the underlying
setting is much too complex
to be able to do it full justice
in one short introduction.
But, what we can hope to do is perhaps
glean some underlying fundamentals
about the movements of this
apparently chaotic phenomenon
of the stocks in the stock market.
And so the question then is,
how does one categorize a stock market?
And how does one characterize portfolios
which govern investment
in the stock market?
Let us begin by considering the movement
and the price of a stock over a given day.
On the day I recorded this lecture
I looked at the movement in price
of the stock of Apple Incorporated.
Now, at the end of the day of trading,
one stock in Apple was worth 127.08.
Of course the movement of
the stock price is chaotic,
random, apparently unpredictable
over the course of the day.
The natural point of reference for
us then is, how much the stock is
appreciated by the end of the day
from where it was the previous day,
or how much it has lost ground?
And so the natural point of reference is,
what was the closing price
of the stock in Apple at the close
of the previous day's trading?
And if you'll look at
the right of your figure,
you'll find in fine print
that at the previous close,
the stock price for Apple was 126.46.
In other words,
there's been a slight appreciation.
The percentage of
depreciation is captured in
this idea of the price
relative of the stock.
The relative price at the close of today
to the close of
the previous day's trading.
So, let's give it a name.
Let's call this the price
of the stock relative.
Let's call this X and is defined
to be the price at closing today,
divided by the price at close
of trading of the previous day.
For the given numbers, X turns out
to be 127.08 divided by 126.46,
or just a smidgen more than 1, 1.0049.
That was about a one
half percent increase,
an uptick in the price of the stock,
and this is fairly typical.
In routine days, stock prices move up or
move down gradually,
and so we end up having price
relatives which hover around one.
Of course if one has a calamity, a very
sharp bear market, and the stop, stock
prices drop dramatically, then of course,
we'll have a number much less than one.
If, on the other hand,
we have some irrational exuberance,
in the words of the former
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
If an irrational exuberance and unbridled
optimism, and maybe on a given day,
a stock price may jump up substantially.
But typically we expect
the stock price relative, X,
to be somewhere near one, maybe just a bit
below one if you have lost a little bit of
ground, maybe just a little bit above
one if you've gained some ground.
All right,
now let us see what might happen if we
invest on this day on Apple Computer.
All right, so we're going to look at
an investment, at the close of trading
on the previous day, we purchase a stock,
or more than a stock.
And then we examine what it is worth,
at the end of today's trading.
Suppose we had invested $1,
one Euro, one Rupee in Apple,
at the close of trading
of the previous day.
How much is it worth?
Well naturally it is worth
exactly the price relative.
So $1 at the,
at the end of the previous day's trading
is now worth $X at the end
of today's trading.
Of course we could invest more than $1 or
less than $1 in principle.
Suppose we invest a fraction a,
a's some real number.
If we invest a, how much do we get?
Well, it will now be worth a times X.
Each dollar gives you X,
therefore a gives you a times X.
Excellent.
We now have an understanding of what
an investment will bring us for
this stock on this day.
But of course,
we know that it's dangerous to invest
all our eggs in one basket,
however pretty the basket.
This leaves us completely exposed
to the vagaries of stock movements.
And so, a natural way of hedging
against the risk of movements of these
individual stocks is to diversify,
to invest in a portfolio of stocks.
Look, for this now, we need to consider,
not one stock, not one company, but
an ensemble of stocks.
So, let's take a look
at a stock market and
again, we are going to look
at one day of trading.
Now, what is a stock
market characterized by?
Well it's going to be characterized
by possibly several companies and
several publicly traded stocks.
How many?
Well let us say there are n
stocks that are being traded, and
the individual stocks may go up,
they may go down.
Each of the individual
stocks then is characterized
by a stock price relative for that stock.
So let's say there are stocks one, two,
three up til m, and let's say that for
the jth stock, over the course of that
day, the price relative for that stock is,
in a natural notation,
x subscript j, or simply, xj.
So X1 represents the price relative for
stock one, X2 for
stock two, Xm for stock m.
Bear in mind, we typically anticipate
that these numbers X1 through Xm
are bobbling around one,
though of course they could be turbulent.
They could either be very
much larger than one, or
perhaps much smaller than one if you have
either a, a bull market or a bear market.
But this is what we typically expect,
these X's, are so many of them.
Let's characterize this
vector of possibilities,
these m possibilities by giving it a name.
Let's call it bold face X and
now the stock market is
characterized by this bold face
X of stock price relatives.
Now, this is telling us what has happened
from the close of trading yesterday
to the close of trading today for
each of the individual stocks.
What is the appreciation or the loss,
in position, for each of those stocks?
We now have an investment question.
Let's say we have a dollar to invest.
We could invest it all in a given stock,
perhaps Apple, or
we could split up the dollar and
invest it across multiple stocks.
This is what is called a portfolio.
So what is a portfolio?
It is an allocation of our wealth
across the different stocks.
So let us say again,
we focus on a generic stock j.
And let's say, at the close of
trading on the previous day,
I invest a portion a sub j of my wealth,
in that stock.
Now, that means I invest
a sub 1 in stock one,
a sub 2 in stock two, a sub m in stock m.
And these represent
the fractions of a wealth
that have distributed across these stocks.
Of course since the a sub
j's represent fractions,
they are numbers between zero and one.
They could be zero.
If an aj is zero, that just means
you've invested nothing in stock j.
And, if a particular aj is one, that means
you put all your eggs in one basket.
You invested all your
money in that one stock.
But more generally,
you want to spread your wealth around,
across multiple stocks.
And this is the essence of
a diversified portfolio.
You hedge your risk by spreading
the risk across many entities.
Again these numbers, a sub j have to be
non negative, and because you're dividing
your total wealth across these entities,
these numbers have to add to one.
So your portfolio then is
a vector of these possibilities.
Let's call that bold face little a.
So now we have an idea of our portfolio.
Let us fix a particular designation
of allocation of resources
across these stocks.
Let's fix a particular fort, portfolio.
This is our investment at the end
of the previous day's trading.
Having invested in this fashion,
having spread your wealth in this fashion,
what is your wealth worth
today at the end of trading?
So, let's take stock.
So, we're starting with an investment at
the previous close, and now we are asking,
what is the value of the investment now,
at the end of today's close?
Let's start by saying
what if we invested $1?
Now the $1 is split into these pieces.
A portion a1 of the $1 goes to stock one.
A portion a2 goes to stock two.
A portion am goes to stock m.
An a1 investment in stock one,
which has a price relative X1,
will earn you a1 times X1 at
the end of today from stock one.
Likewise, an a2 investment in stock two,
which has a price relative of X2,
Well I've earned you a2 times X2 for
stock two, and so on and so forth.
And a sub m investment in
stock m at the end of today's
trading will have earned you am times Xm.
And naturally your net wealth now
is going to be the sum of a1X1,
a2X2, through amXm.
Let's give this a name.
Let's call this sum, s for sum of course,
but of course the sum depends upon
the particular stock price relatives,
bold face X.
Depending on how the stocks move,
the sum is going to move around, for
a fixed portfolio a, right?
So let's give it a name.
Let's call it S, and of course,
S depends implicitly on the particular
stock price relatives for that day.
What if we had a wealth W to invest at
the end of the previous day's trading?
Well, then each dollar
in W will earn S(X) and
therefore W dollars will have
earned you today W times S(X).
So, S of X is now a critical
element to look at.
What does it come out?
It is the amount wealth has grown if $1
were invested over the course of a day,
where a vector of stock
price relatives x resulted.
In other words,
S of X tells you the ratio of
your wealth at the end of today,
to the wealth at the end of yesterday.
We'll call this simply then,
the wealth relative,
the wealth at the end of today, relative
to the wealth at the end of yesterday.
So, the game here now is clearly
going to be devolving upon the nature
of these wealth relatives.
Bear in mind that underlying
these experiments
is going to be a chance phenomenon,
a very complicated chance phenomenon.
So, in general,
the X's are going to be chance driven and
we are not going to be apriory or
able to be able to predict what an X is.
If one could of course,
we could make a lot of money very quickly.
So the wealth relatives, S of X,
are themselves chance driven, and dictated
ultimately by the choice of portfolio.
So this is what is going
to be coming up next.
Let us now look at what happens when
we look at not one day of trading, but
a succession of days of trading.
