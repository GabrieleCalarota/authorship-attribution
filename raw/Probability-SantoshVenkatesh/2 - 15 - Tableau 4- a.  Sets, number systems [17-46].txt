Tableau 4, a little set of theory.
[MUSIC]
In our last module, we discussed
chance in commonplace settings.
A basic feature that I rose repeatedly in
these settings was in the consideration
of aggregates of outcomes,
collections of outcomes, sets of outcomes.
The mathematical language of
sets provides the alphabet
with which we describe elements
in the theory of chance.
So at this time it'll be convenient for
us to remind ourselves that basic
elements of sets and operations on sets.
We will not need very much
from the basic theory.
This is the kind of material which
is traditionally seen sometime
in a high school
curriculum in mathematics.
And we will review the basic
elements that are needed for
us to describe chance
elements in this context.
For those of you who
are familiar with basic sets and
set set operations,
you could jump ahead to the summary.
Quickly refresh your memory
of the basic concepts and
then move on to our development
of the theory of chance.
For others, stay with me and
we will develop the basic elements.
So to begin, what is a set?
A set is a collection of objects.
To focus our attention,
pick something quite commonplace.
Let's, for example,
pick a collection of fruit, say pears.
I happen to like pears.
Now what I'm showing you is a collection
of eight different kinds of pears.
I understand actually from
the Pear Growers Association.
I didn't know there existed such an
entity, but the Pear Growers Association
actually claims there are more
than 3,000 varieties of pears.
But that seemed a bit excessive for
today's lecture, so
we'll begin with eight pears.
And you know what it is?
These pears are distinctive.
They've got distinctive features, colors,.
The key element for us is that
they are distinct types of pears.
And we represent it mathematically
by enclosing the collection
in curly brackets.
And as always in this kind of
context when you are dealing with
collections of objects,
aggregates of objects,
we describe it mathematically
succinctly by using curly brackets.
Okay.
And so, these curly brackets then connote,
for our purposes,
eight different kinds of pears.
Now, the semantics here are not
particularly relevant for our purposes.
It is not so critical that the first
pear on that list is an Anjou pear, or
perhaps let's say the fourth or
fifth pear on the list is a Bosc pear.
What matters is that there
are eight different objects.
Now we could have described
these objects quite differently.
Instead of just putting them
in a basket and saying well,
here are eight fruit types, we could
have listed them, say by their names.
For example, Anjou, Bartlett,
Starkrimson, Bosc, and so forth.
What is material here is that these names,
these images represent objects which
we have a common understanding for.
The individual pears have
particular characteristics.
Shape, color, perhaps taste,
texture, where they are used.
These provide the underlying semantics
where we want to use these collections.
And this semantics is ordinarily not
particularly relevant for our purposes.
What matters is there
are eight kinds of objects.
Now with this kind of
understanding in mind,
we could give these objects
any kind of name we wished.
For instance, we could simply call
the objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
Implicit in this kind of description
is a compact, a common understanding.
A dictionary of translation
that one assumes has been
established ahead of time.
So in our case,
1 could represent the first kind of
pear on that list, perhaps an Anjou.
2 could represent a Bartlett,
the second pear on the list, and so forth.
With this common understanding we might
just as well deal with a collection
of eight numbers, 1 through 8.
Or if you wished, letters,
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h.
The selection of
description is dictated by
common necessity, and an overriding
idea is the simpler the better.
Nothing is wise that complicates
existence, and in this case,
we pick simple names,
simple descriptions for objects.
As long, of course,
as there is no possibility for confusion.
What about other objects that might arise?
Well, let me think about another,
again, visual kind of setting.
You're all familiar with the idea
of graphs in the calculus.
We describe functions typically visually
by drawing a graph of the function.
Graphs appear in other areas
in mathematics as well.
And in graph theory, graphs connote
entities which are described by
two kinds of objects,
commonly called vertices and edges.
You could think of vertices as dots
on a page, one dot per vertex.
And you can think of edges as
connections between the dots.
Draw lines between
the dots to create edges.
Now, here's a very simple
kind of graphical structure.
Think of a graph on three vertices
with some description of edges.
Okay, and here we go.
Three vertices,
I've numbered them 1, 2, and 3.
They appear in,
as red dots on your screen.
And now the graph is completely described
once I tell you there are three vertices
by which edges, which lines are present.
So, we can now in a very lexicographic way
describe the various possibilities for
these entities.
Graphs on three vertices by
describing systematically
graphs with no edges,
graphs with precisely one edge,
graphs with two edges, and
finally graphs with three edges.
You should convince yourself that I
have listed all possibilities here.
There are eight different possibilities
for graphs on three vertices.
Now where do these kinds of things arise?
Well, they arise in all kinds
of settings in the 21st century.
If one thinks of a very complex social
network like Facebook or like Twitter,
we can imagine the participants as
vertices in a very large graph.
And connections between vertices,
for example,
are friends in Facebook,
people who see each other.
Now you understand or
you begin to get a feeling for
why objects like these could become
important in a variety of engineering,
scientific and mathematical settings.
Once we have established that we
are going to be dealing with graphs
on three vertices, then we could have
an implicit dictionary of translation.
And without explicitly drawing them,
or exhibiting them, or
giving you graphs in a basket,
simply give them names.
Our dictionary of translation might say,
let's provide a lexicographic arrangement
of these graphs on three vertices
starting with graphs of no vertices.
And then building up systematically one,
two, three, four up to a graph with
all edges available on the three vertices,
and that's graph number 8.
With such a dictionary of translation,
the numbers 1 through 8 then, completely
describe the picture on the left.
What about more complex syntax?
And now in abstraction,
sets collections that
appear routinely again and
again are collections or sets of numbers.
And these have a particular
important importance.
So let's turn to these next.
And, at this point, you know,
we should bear in mind,
that the kinds of descriptions I've
given you of sets is explicit.
For example, I've given you a basket,
or more formally two curly brackets,
which represents this basket,
this collection.
And inside this basket,
I've been putting entities.
The entities don't have
any particular order.
All that matters is what is in
the basket in that collection.
And for visual clarity we've
separated the entities by commas.
Of course, that wasn't essential if
you could clearly separate them.
But when we're dealing with
an alphabet involving a common theme,
sometimes things run into each other and
it'll be useful to visually separate
them by commas, spaces, what have you.
These are all explicit representations.
I've listed everything in the collection.
And okay.
This makes a good starting point for
describing collections of numbers.
So let's start with the very
simplest collections.
The simplest collection of numbers
arises in the theory of logic,
what is sometimes called Boolean algebra.
It crops up routinely in modern
day binary digital communications.
Where the idea is that the basic
element for describing objects is
one of two letters, zero or
one, false or true, yes or no.
Now, if you put numbers around these,
the simplest description is zero and
one in some order.
You could say one, comma,
zero, or zero, comma, one.
The arrangement does not make much matter.
Again, we enclose this in curly brackets.
The context's telling
us that this is a set.
A collection of objects,
very simple to be true,
on which I am going to actually build some
kind of theory, some kind of analysis.
This is an explicit
representation of object at hand.
Let's go on to something
a little bit deeper.
For imagine, consider the throw of a die.
If we imagine that the die faces have
numbers one through six painted on them,
representing the actual pips we see.
One pip, two pips,
all the way up to six pips.
Here's our dictionary of translation.
Then is natural to denote
the possible outcomes
of the throw of a die by one of
the numbers from one through six.
And again we have
an explicit representation.
But there's another possibility.
We could describe this
collection implicitly.
Okay.
And this is going to become important
when sets get richer and richer, and
it becomes impossible to explicitly
list all the possibilities.
What would an implicit representation
of this throw of a die mean?
Well, let's generalize this a little bit.
Imagine in one hat a die with many faces,
not necessarily six.
Well, how many faces?
Well, I don't want to put an apron or
a restriction
on how many faces a die could have or
how many outcomes you could say.
So what should I call it?
Well, inevitably I want to call this
an algebraic variable fixed but arbitrary.
And, again, inevitably long tradition and
custom has inured us to
calling such variables N.
Why N?
Well, because it is inconceivable
that I call it anything else.
And so now we have a collection of N
numbers representing, for example,
N faces on a tie, N distinct objects,
N pairs, N graphs.
Again we enclose it in curly brackets.
Now, an implicit representation for
this is, we've now have
a dictionary of translation.
We've got numbers one through N.
These are integer numbers.
So an implicit representation
would be to write down a generic
letter representing an element
of that set, of that collection.
In this case, again, long custom
tells us to write down a letter,
lowercase n,
to represent a typical number.
Notice how we've described this.
We first write down a generic,
a typical element of the set.
N, fixed but arbitrary.
Put in a colon and say following this,
this object described is
described by this condition.
Now this gives us a generic way of
describing more and more complex sets.
This is a descriptive or
implicit way of describing a set.
Let's move on to a slightly
richer collection.
Where do you go beyond
a finite collection?
Well, of course an infinite collection.
And the simplest infinite collection
is that of the natural numbers.
How do we describe them?
Well, if we want try to rescript, describe
it explicitly, I would start by writing
down the number one, then the number two,
possibly the number three.
And then I realize well I really cannot
write down all possible natural numbers.
There's an infinite number of them.
And so we put down a sequence of dots.
And the dots means and so on and so forth.
This is the idea.
This is an attempt at an explicit
representation for these numbers.
How would an implicit
representation look like?
How would a descriptive
representation look like?
Well, we write down a generic letter n and
say that this n satisfies
the following property.
We describe the property that
a typical member of the set satisfies.
In this case, n is any natural number.
And now we have it, an implicit or
descriptive notation for this.
Now this set is widely seen,
and it's hugely important.
And therefore,
long tradition has given us a name for it.
And this name is a short form
which captures the entire set
much like somebody's name is a short
way of describing that person.
In this case, a name for a natural
number is given by a boldface letter N.
Now, this blackboard bold font means from
now on the system of natural numbers.
And this is the notation we adopt for it.
Where do we go from the natural numbers?
Well, history tells us that a zero was
discovered somewhere in the Middle East or
perhaps India.
And once a zero is discovered,
negative numbers were discovered, and
these then create the family
of a set of integers.
These are important.
We'll see them repeatedly.
They have a name denoted by
blackboard bulge zed, and
they connote explicitly all integers we're
familiar with, zero, one and minus one,
two and minus two, three and
minus three and so on.
And the descriptive notation
says this is a collection of
letters N where N is any integer.
Still more complex orders of
infinity are available and,
of course, the most common one for
us is the real line.
The real line now moves from counting
objects onto a continuum of objects.
The notation or the language for
it is blackboard bold R.
We denote it by a line, and we implicitly
think of a real line of length.
We sometimes represent it by
an open interval familiar from
calculus running from minus infinity on
one hand to plus infinity on the other.
And you describe it by saying
it's a collection of objects x.
Why x?
Again, because it is inconceivable I call
a real number anything else, isn't it?
And x must satisfy
the following properties.
It is a real number in the range from
minus infinity to plus infinity.
Of course the names that we give
these objects don't make much matter.
We could choose other names for integers.
For example, tradition compels us to use
letters in the middle portion of the Latin
alphabet, I, J, K, L, M and N,
typically to denote integers.
N denoting a generic such integer.
Similarly for real numbers, tradition
compels us to use letters at the end of
the Latin alphabet, S,
T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z.
And we use x as a typical or
generic member.
Now these kinds of sets or
systems are going to be important to us.
But even more complex
collections can be emulation
