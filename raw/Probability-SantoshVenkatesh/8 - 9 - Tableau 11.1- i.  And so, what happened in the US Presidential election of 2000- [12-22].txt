Polls are endemic in modern life.
Pollsters seek our opinions
on anything and everything.
Our opinions on toothpaste,
on the newest video game,
on the new movies, on a film star.
And especially in politics.
There is perhaps no other place
where polling and opinions get so
fraught with emotion.
And for the reason's I've just given you,
relatively small polls
can give us accurate results
with high confidence.
Except when they don't.
A case in point, apparently,
was the bitterly
contested Presidential
election of the year 2000.
The protagonists were the Republican
George W Bush and the Democrat Al Gore.
The peculiarities of the U.S.
presidential election system meant
that states were allotted to presidential
candidates on a winner-take-all basis.
So whoever won the popular vote in, say,
Florida would then win
the state of Florida.
The election was very close, and
everything then hinged upon which of the
two candidates won the state of Florida.
As the votes were counted,
polls were being reported in
real time on the TV networks.
Now, why bother reporting the polls?
Say, after all, within a day we
were going to know the result.
But we are an impatient race,
we'd like to know the answer before
the answer's actually provided to us.
And so, pollsters camp outside election
booths and query people who voted.
Who did you vote for?
You now have a captive audience, you see,
people have voted, they're coming out of
the polling booths, and so
it's very easy to ask them questions.
So, these are called exit polls and
you can very quickly engender a large
amount of data, much more than the small
numbers using Chebyshev's inequality.
By 10 pm that evening,
the networks had called Florida for
the Democratic candidate, Al Gore,
and therefore, the presidency.
But by midnight, doubts were creeping in,
into their pronouncement.
And by 2 pm, they had reversed course and
said, oh, no, no.
The Florida, the state of Florida
is actually won by George W Bush.
And therefore, the presidency now
is going to go to George W Bush.
Remember, this was actually
the pivotal state.
This battleground was going to
determine who won the election.
Now, what could possibly go wrong?
Have I been telling you a big fib?
By 10 pm already,
millions of votes had been counted.
Not one or 2,000 or 3,000, but millions.
And I've already told you a small
sample should give us good estimates of
the proportions.
Which proportion of the populist is
going to go to George W Bush and
what proportion of the vote
is going to go to Al Gore?
We should already have
extraordinary good estimates.
And yet, apparently, it was not enough.
By 2 pm,
millions of the votes had been counted and
the election had swung
the other direction.
And by early morning, the networks
had left the field in disarray.
They said we don't know who won.
And by this time,
almost all the votes have been counted.
Something seems to have gone badly wrong.
Was it with the mathematics or
was there something else going on?
To come to right understanding we're
going to have to dig into a little bit of
the details of what was
seen unfolded in that year.
So, in that year,
the number of votes that were cast in
Florida was very close to 6 million.
It turned out to be a very tight election.
Yes now, the numbers I want to show you
have been debated in many quarters.
Many different counts have been
provided with different numbers.
But what all the protagonists have agreed,
is that which a way these votes were
counted, the difference between the few,
the candidates was of the order
of a few hundred votes.
Here is one such official count.
Mr. Bush got very close
to 3 million votes.
Mr. Gore got very close
to 3 million votes.
As a proportion of
the voting population then,
each of them received very close to
50% of the votes that were cast.
If for the numbers I've given you Mr.
Bush obtains just slightly more than 50%.
A smidgen more than 50% of the vote.
Mr. Gore,
a smidgen less than 50% of the vote.
Now to get a feeling for
the complication that this causes, let's
take a look at a slightly more sanitized
example where two candidates
are separated by 1% of the vote.
Say one candidate gets 51% or so,
more precisely, 50.5% of the vote.
And the other candidate,
49.5% of the vote.
Now, recall that in the process of
polling, we are going to make errors.
The more the data we have,
the smaller the error we can guarantee.
But take a look at a consequence
of even a small error,
let's say an error of
1.5% in estimating a p.
And therefore also in estimating a q.
If p, 50.5% in this example is
off by 1.5%, say it is on the low side.
Then what happens?
Well the 50.5% becomes 49%, and
therefore the q,
which was originally 49.5%
now increases by 1.5%,
and now becomes 51%.
The roles of the candidates
have now reversed.
The candidate two who's leading because
of a slight error in the estimate
is now the candidate who's following.
And abruptly our entire perception of we,
who wins and who loses is now upside down.
It's now clear what we
need in our estimate.
You see, the idea here is not
just estimating a proportion, but
estimating a relative proportion.
Not just estimating p or q, but
estimating a difference between them.
We need an error, which is no more than
half the separation between p and q.
So that in the worst case, p can't edge
more than half the distance toward q.
And q can't edge more than
half the distance towards p,
keeping the relative ordering unchanged.
And therefore, for a generic value for
p and q, we need an error no more than
one-half of the absolute value of
the difference between p and q.
Whether p is bigger than q or
q is bigger than p makes little matter.
They just reverses the roles
of the protagonists.
You want the error to be no
more than half the separation.
And in our example with both p and
q bobbling just around 50%, whatever the,
the, the count we actually adopt.
It turns out,
the error epsilon we need is about,
something like two parts in 100,000.
Well, this is remarkable.
This is really, really, really small.
With such a small epsilon, if you say we
want a confidence in our poll of 90%.
Recall the sample size by
the Chebyshev estimate increases like
the reciprocal of 4 times the square of
the error times the confidence parameter.
You plug in these numbers and
we find that the requisite sample size for
this tiny area and with a confidence
of say, 90% is in excess of 1 billion.
Pause and look at this again.
A sample size in excess of 1 billion
to capture what 6 million people said.
This is absurd.
Remember sampling ideally is
going to be with replacement
from the entire voting population.
This is going to say that every
member who voted in Florida should
be queried in average 200 times
asking the same question each time.
Who won the election?
And if you did that, and
if they didn't get mad at you and
throw you out, you would actually
get a beautiful precise answer.
And you'd be able to separate Mr.
Bush and Mr. Gore.
But of course that is absurd statement.
Polling breaks when you
need such accuracies.
Now, in such settings of course,
the natural thing to do is to say well,
polls are useless lets throw it out
the window, just count everybody.
Well, that, that's exactly what
the election does doesn't it?
But we actually now run
into a different problem.
I alluded earlier to the fact that
there have been multiple counts, and
that the counts all gave
slightly different answers.
And the reason is, that any counting
procedure rather it's human in this case
as it was in Florida in 2000, or
even if it's a machine-aided count.
For example, a mechanical process or
an optical electronic process.
Any counting methodology
introduces an error flaw
which is ineluctable which is
there as a consequence of nature.
Life happens.
The error flaw is typically of
the order of a few hundreds
in the order of millions.
And so, for
an election of this close a magnitude,
no amount of counting is likely
to have made much difference.
The answers are going to have,
be wobbling around back and
forth, depending upon which way
the counting errors took us.
In such situations, the idea of
an abstract truth is unachievable.
The idea of who actually really
won the election is forever.
Not achievable.
We'll hit an ineluctable arrow flow.
Perhaps, the only thing that one
could do at this point is actually,
this is not what happened, of course.
Is to run the election all over again and
hope that enough people
change their minds.
That, the difference between the candidate
becomes more than a few hundred.
So, here now is a refined slogan.
It is certainly true that a small, honest,
random sample gives us very good estimates
with high confidence irrespective
of the size of the underlying
population or their predisposition.
But if one wants more than good accuracy,
if one wants extraordinary accuracy,
if one wants incredibly high precision,
then random sampling and
polling become untenable.
We're going to have to count
the entire population and
try to keep the errors under control.
