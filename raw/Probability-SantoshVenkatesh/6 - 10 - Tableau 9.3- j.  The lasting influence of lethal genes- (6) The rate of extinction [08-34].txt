Let us now put our results to good use.
Ultimately of course,
we are interested in how
a particular gene propagates through
generations, possibly very many, right.
Our lesson so far is the following.
If, in a parental generation,
the lethal gene
is manifested or proffered in the mating
population in a proportional, let us say,
one in ten, or 10%, then,
in the filial generation, that lethal
gene will be proffered with a slightly
smaller probability of one in eleven.
Imagine now that we have
a succession of generations, and
we will simplify matters here.
In each generation, the proportion
of the lethal gene that is proffered
in the mating population satisfies
a simple relation to the proportion
of the lethal gene in the mating
population of the previous generation.
It is given by the relationship,
the reciprocal of q prime,
is equal to the reciprocal of q plus one,
on the upper right of your screen.
Bear in mind,
that this factor q represents
one-half of the proportion
of heterozygous elements
in the mating population.
Remember the fraction of heterozygous
elements in the parental
mating population was
twice v over 1 minus w.
And of that fraction,
one-half of that gives you exactly
the chance of a particular lethal
gene being proffered during mating.
Now imagine that we have a setting
where you start from some,
say, progenitor, a generation zero,
if you will, where the genotypes existed
under proportions u sub 0,
twice v sub 0, w sub 0.
From the progenitor,
imagine here we have generation one,
then generation two thereafter,
three, four, so forth and so
on going down to lets just
say the nth generation.
In each generation,
the genotype frequencies change,
and we will make a simplifying assumption
here, that we identify the actual
proportions in the population with
their expected probabilities.
In other words, for generation 1, let
us say the proportions are u1, 2v1, w1.
Generation two, u2, 2v2,
w2, and so on and so forth,
and in generation n the proportions
of the three genotypes
are in the n the ratios u sub n,
2v sub n, and w sub n.
Of course, we're interested in
what happens to the lethal gene,
as you progressed through the generations.
Let us consider the nth generation
as the filial generation and
the n minus 1th as the parental
generation to start matters off.
We have, by looking at the top right
of your screen, identified q prime
with q sub n, and identified q with q sub
n minus 1, the reciprocal relationship.
The reciprocal of q n is
the reciprocal of q n minus 1 plus 1.
Now pause for a moment,
now this is beguiling because
now we've just moved matters up
to the n minus 1th generation.
If we think of them as a filial
generation, and the n minus 2th generation
as the parental generation, then we can
either define q n minus one with q prime
in the upper right of your figure,
and now q n minus two with q.
And therefore,
this devolves into the equation,
the reciprocal of q n minus 2 plus 1,
plus 1 from the previous line.
But again, now I can think of n minus
2 as the filial generation, and n
minus 3 as the parental generation, which
gives us the next step in the process,
the reciprocal of q n minus 3 plus 1,
plus 1, plus 1.
And of course now we can
continue this process again and
again, and of course you recognize
the process of induction.
And eventually get up to
the progenitor generation
at which point we'll have
the reciprocal of q 0,
the original proportion of the little
gene in the original mating population.
And now we have accumulated n 1s, one
each time we step through a generation.
And therefore, we have got this
beautiful and elegant result.
The reciprocal of the proportion of
the lethal gene in the nth generation
is given by the reciprocal of the lethal
gene in the progenitor generation,
which is some fixed number,
whatever it is, plus n.
Of course now we really are interested
in actual proportions, so
we should just flip the fractions over and
if we do that, we obtain a beautiful and
elegant result q sub n
on the left is equal
to the reciprocal of q 0 to
the power of minus 1 plus n.
One can hardly have hoped for
a much simpler expression for
the way things evolved as
the system progressed.
Now we should pause and
take a good hard look at this.
What is this telling us?
So ultimately, at the end of this
exercises, we do have an elegant and
simple formulation, but what does it say?
Now to be sure, our analysis has
been of necessity simplistic.
We have assumed, for example,
that the proportions
of the genotypes in each generation,
coincide with their expected values.
In practice, of course,
there will be natural stochastic variation
of the actual proportions
of the population,
in each of these genotypes just due
to natural probabilistic variation.
We've ignored the possibilities for
example of a,
a population explosion,
of mutations and so on.
But nonetheless,
even such a simplified analysis
gives useful biometric information.
It tells us large trends in the setting.
So we should conclude with a slogan.
In a setting where one has a recessive and
lethal gene, we anticipate
that a lethal gene will be eventually
excised from the population,
eill eventually die out, but
the rate of decay is painfully slow.
It goes as slowly as the harmonic series.
The listener may recall Darwin's
warning that natural selection and
evolution.= proceed over
very large time scales.
The kind of phenomenon we have discovered
in the dissolution of a lethal
gene is indicative of the general
kinds of phenomena one should expect.
Random mixing and
selection take a long time,
and this is supportive
of the general theme.
Darwin's theory is one of the great
jewels of human thought and endeavor.
It was contentious to begin with but
over the course of the centuries,
the amount of evidence in its favor is,
has become so large that it,
it has become one of the defining
theories of the age.
A, a wonderful and deep and
subtle understanding of the very
nature of the evolution of species.
One should not expect all our applications
to be on quite so sublime a level.
So for our next application,
let's go back to our first principles,
to our very first lecture, go back to
an issue in the psychology of sports.
