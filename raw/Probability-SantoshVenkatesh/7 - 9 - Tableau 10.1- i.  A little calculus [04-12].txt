So, just a little bit of calculus.
We are trying to maximize for a given
value of r between 0 and 1, the function,
f of x, given by x to the power r times
1 minus x to the power of 1 minus r.
On the right-hand side, you observe
that we really have the product of two
functions, a function x to the power r.
Let's call that, g of x temporarily.
And a function 1 minus x to the power,
1 minus r.
Let's call that, h of x.
So, f of x is a product of two functions,
g of x and h of x.
I want to maximize f.
Elementary calculus tells us
that to maximize a function,
I take its derivative and
find where the slope is 0.
Right?
And that's where the cusp
of the function is.
[SOUND] How do you take a derivative?
Well, I'm going to have to take
a derivative of the functions g and h.
But each of these functions
is the form of a power.
And I know exactly what an elementary
differentiation of a power is.
So, you start with the, a formula for
the derivative of a power.
And apply with that,
the change rule for differentiation.
The derivative of a product g times h,
is g prime h plus g h prime.
And that is all that you'll need.
Then, all is over by the shouting because
what's left is just simply algebra.
So, let's start.
Identify x to the power r
of the function g of x,
1 minus x to the power 1 minus
r of the function h of x.
By the change rule,
the derivative of the product g
times h is g prime h plus g h prime.
And those are the two terms on the right.
G prime is the derivative of a power and
that we will write down.
H prime is the derivative of another
power, and we right that down as well.
And now, we've got an expression
involving products of powers.
You should pause, write this down,
and make sure she absorbs it.
Once you've got that far,
we'll just collect common terms.
The power x to the power r minus 1, and
the power 1 minus x to the power 1 minus
r minus 1, as common from both sides.
And that accumulate the remaining terms,
from each of the two terms
inside the square brackets.
Very good.
Now, just go ahead and
expand what is inside the square brackets.
That's very simple.
Go write it out and
we find that the term RX cancels inside
leaving something very nice and
simple in the square brackets.
Now, let's take stock.
In front of the square
brackets on the right,
we've got a term which
is strictly positive.
Or at least it's nonnegative.
As x varies between 0 and 1.
So, the only way if x is not 0 or 1, for
the derivative of the product to be 0,
is that the thing in
the square brackets is 0.
And so, if x is away from 0 or
1, you'll get 0 for
the derivative, if and
only if x is equal to r.
Now, what about the end cases,
x equal to 0 and x equal to 1?
Now, these cases are trivial.
And because in this case, you have
a function, which is anchored at 0.
All right, you saw these
functions going up like this.
So, they're anchored at zero.
They're trivial cases.
Those end cases, it will give you maximum.
So, the maximum is going
to be at an interior point,
which is exactly the point
where x equal to r.
And therefore, we conclude,
that the function f of x achieves
its maximum when x is equal to r.
R was s over 8.
And this leads to our conclusion that, in
fact, the maximum likelihood estimate for
your sample estimating the unknown
probability p is exactly s over n.
