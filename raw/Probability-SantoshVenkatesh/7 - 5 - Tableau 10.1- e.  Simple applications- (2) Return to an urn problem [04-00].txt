We have seen that urn mortals
are frequently useful in a mortal and
complex phenomena.
Let's start with a plain,
rather banal problem.
Quite I don't have any particular
application in mind other than
of an illustration of calculations
involving the binomial.
So here is an urn problem.
Suppose n balls are randomly
distributed into r urns.
We think of the first
ten as distinguished and
we ask what are the chance that there
are exactly k balls in the first urn?
What is the chance that the first
two urns between them get k balls?
Pause for a moment.
See if you can set up the problem,
and write it down.
And when you're ready, resume the lecture.
Now that you're back,
it's clear that I have in mind a relation
between this urn problem and
a coin tossing problem.
And the metaphor is going
to be fairly clear.
Suppose S represents the number
of balls in the first hand and
let T represent the number of
balls in the first two hands.
They are of course chance variables and
I'd like to say something about both S and
T.
Now what can I say about it?
Let, let's think about the first urn.
There are n balls, and
each ball has got a probability,
1 over r,
of being placed in the first urn.
There are exactly r possibilities, and so
the chance is 1 over r that
you go into one of them.
The balls are placed into the hands
independently of each other.
If we define success as,
a ball is placed into the first urn, then
what we are really doing is tossing a coin
whose success probability is 1 over r.
And we toss this n times.
One for each of the balls.
And therefore the number of balls that
end up in the first urn is governed
by the accumulated number of
successes in these n tosses.
In other words,
it's going to be governed by a binomial
distribution corresponding to n trials.
One for each of the balls,
whose success probability is 1 over r,
of landing in the first urn.
What about the first
two urns put together?
Well, this is just a small
variation on that theme.
If you imagine the first two urns together
as forming a block, the chance of any ball
falling into the first, or
the second urn, is 2 in r.
There are two out of the r
possibilities that it could land into.
We now have a succession
of n Bernoulli trials
where the success
probability now is 2 over r.
And therefore, T,
the number of balls in the first two urns,
is governed by a binomial distribution,
corresponding to n trials.
And with a success probability p now,
is now 2 over r.
And with this in hand,
we can now simply write down our problems.
The probability that the first urn
sees exactly k balls is governed
by the binomial probability corresponding
to n trials where k successes.
And where the success
probability is 1 over r.
Let me just write it down.
The probability that the first
two urns in k balls is governed
exactly by the binomial probability,
of corresponding to n trials and
success probability p of 2 over r.
And exactly k successes,
and there we have it.
