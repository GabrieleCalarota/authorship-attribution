Tableau 10, from polls to bombs.
Part 2, The Poisson flits in.
We have seen how the binomial
distribution arises naturally
in the context of polls and polling
systems, and we shall return to this.
But today, we shall take a small
detour through an accidental
discovery of Simo√©n Denis Poisson,
in the year 1837.
And, this discovery was to have subtle and
deep consequences.
Along the way, we shall discovery
the Poisson distribution.
Which, together with
a binomial distribution, and
the normal distribution, constitute
the triad of fundamental distributions
in the theory of probability.
The context is historical and rich.
And, the setting is that of judicial
trials and, in particular, trials by jury.
Listeners of a particular age would be
familiar with the evocative image of
an Atticus defending his client
in To Kill a Mockingbird,
before a bank of jurors
who are deeply skeptical.
The principle of trial by jury is
fundamental to democratic institutions.
And, in the United States,
in particular, in felony trials
it was standard for many, many years
to have a jury of 12 individuals.
In the year 1970, in the case
Williams versus the State of Florida,
this principle was challenged.
Florida had reduced the number of jurors
from twelve to six in
a particular felony case.
Williams challenged it.
And, a bitterly divided
Supreme Court ruled
that a decrease in size of
jury from twelve to six
did not contravene
the constitutional protections
of the rights of the accused
to an impartial jury.
The constitutional connection that is
alluded to is the Sixth Amendment to the,
the United States Constitution.
Which guarantees individuals
a right to a speedy,
public trial with an impartial jury.
Justice White opined in for
the majority in that case,
that there's nothing sacrosanct
about the number of the jury.
So, as I said, a bitterly divided court,
in the majority,
they opined that in the function
of the jury was to exercise common
sense judgement in the complaint between
the plaintiff and the defendant.
But, that the size of the jury did not
effect the quality of this judgement.
After this judgement,
a variety of critiques came up, and
several further judgements
were made as well.
But, as late as 1979,
the court reaffirmed its position.
This time, Justice Rehnquist, writing
on behalf of the majority, opined again
that a jury of size twelve
was in no way more reliable,
in terms of the quality of the decision
making, than a jury of size six.
It is not clear what statistical, or
mathematical references,
the court was using, if any, at that time.
But, a fundamental question surely arises.
Now, I surely do not want to get into
the niceties of the legal arguments here,
or of what the Constitution actually says.
We're treading very close to the limits
of my knowledge on the subject.
But, as a citizen,
it is clear that we need functioning
juries to give us justice.
And, a fundamental question then arises,
what principles,
mathematical principles,
logical principles,
societal principles,
should govern the size of a jury?
Now, the nearest antecedent
to this in history was
about 200 years ago in
late 18th century France.
And, these questions about democracy,
and juries,
and trials, were bubbling and
coming to a heated conclusion.
Of course, this was going to be
the time of the French revolution.
But, a noted philosopher,
mathematician, and
political scientist at that time
was Nicolas, Marquis de Condorcet.
And, Condorcet wrote
extensively on this subject.
In 1785, for instance, he published what
is today called Condercet's jury theorem,
in which he articulated
the following principle.
That, if in a voting group, a jury,
each member is more likely than
not to make a correct decision,
then the probability that
the majority vote yields the right
decision increases as
the group size becomes larger.
Now, I don't want to take
a detour to try to prove this,
though it is not at all hard, right?
And, if the listener now will spend
a couple minutes thinking about what it'll
take when you add two new members
to a jury to improve the decision.
Well, either both could be right,
or both could be wrong.
If they split the decision,
then clearly nothing has changed.
But, if each slightly
favors the correct decision
over an incorrect decision, then the
chance of both getting it right is going
to exceed the chance of both getting it
wrong, and that is all there is to it.
Of course, there is a flip side of
this coin, and that is that if one has
an uninformed jury, a collection of
peers whose decision making is suspect.
And, who are likely
more than half the time
to come up with an incorrect decision,
then the optimal jury size is one.
A larger jury only makes things worse.
Ordre des in 1785, issues of jury size and
selection were becoming more important,
and
deep thinkers were articulating
essential principles behind these ideas.
Now, Condercet was acutely a,
alive to the fact that when
juries make errors, they could make
errors in one of two directions.
And, this was picked up and
articulated by Pierre Simon,
Marquis de Laplace in 1820.
We often malevolent Laplace,
We've seen Laplace.
His ideas arise in his law of
succession in this book on
probability in the year 1812.
Laplace was also deeply interested
in societal issues, and
he weighed on the jury selection issue.
In particular, he articulated
a risk principle which
laid out the essential
difference between the two different
kinds of errors that are possible.
So, if a jury makes an error,
it could be in these two flavors.
They could convict an innocent person,
or they could acquit a guilty person.
And, Laplace was very
clear in his view that
the costs to society were not the same for
the two kinds of errors.
If one looks at Laplace's positioning of
the problem, he seems to be suggesting
that the societal cost is higher
if one acquits a guilty person.
Presumably, to go on and
commit other heinous crimes,
than it is to convict an innocent person.
And clearly,
already here, fundamental questions about
democratic institutions are arising.
In which direction should
we offer more protection?
Fundamentally, here now,
are two questions.
Given a jury size, and
a conviction threshold,
remember the vote typically is
going to be by a majority vote.
What is the probability that
a guilty person is acquitted?
Under these conditions,
what is the probability that
an innocent person is convicted?
Laplace, naturally enough,
given his, his ideas in probability,
put together a chance mechanism
to try to model the setting.
He modeled juror responses as
essentially chance driven.
But, he viewed the intrinsic guilt or
innocence of the defendant
as a pure chance variable,
equally likely to be one or the other.
This created issues and complications.
And, this was picked upon by Poisson.
We should come to Poisson's model next.
