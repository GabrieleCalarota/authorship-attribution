The story that the Marai utilized a such
a naive argument to compute probabilities.
Leading him to the mistaken conclusion
that the two cases were equally like,
is suspicious at best.
The Marai,
the historical of cultures was actually
quite proficient mathematically and
technically.
And it's rather unlikely
that he would have
made such speciously incorrect argument.
Especially one that was so
quickly susceptible of a disproof.
The idea that he could
discern the difference
between the two cases because of
repeated experimentation in gambling.
By winning a great deal on possibility A
and losing a great deal on possibility B,
is perhaps even more
unlikely on the face of it.
Now this is going to
require some analysis.
But the student will be
willing to accept that
the possibilities are actually
very close to each other.
Both of them have a chance
of very close to 50%.
In fact, the difference between
the two cases is about 3%.
Now if one were to toss a coin,
for example.
And we try to determine
whether it was fair.
One, two, three and so forth [SOUND].
How many tosses will be required?
Well, a student would've,
could have well imagined that one would
need a fair number of tries to get enough
data to form an accurate estimate.
And in this case,
the estimate is particularly delicate.
We have to do the experiments
often enough, gamble often enough,
to separate two rather
closely placed hypotheses.
At 0.52 and 0.49.
Now, we'll come back to this this year,
later on, because this is going to be at
the heart of mathematical statistics.
But it is clear that the number of trials
is not going to be something like 100.
In 100 trials, would I be able
to separate 0.52 from 0.49?
It seems unlikely.
And in fact,
the number of trials is going to be
something like the ultra of 5,000 trials.
It's very hard to imagine that some one
played this game 5,000 or 7,000 times.
And not only played this came,
I can imagine lets say,
a smoke filled tavern
where people are gambling.
But not just gambling, but in the heat
of the moment you're also keeping track
of everyone of the results of
these 5,000 gambles or trials.
That sounds incredible implausible.
But nonetheless it's a good story.
Now we've got an idea of how to begin by
analyzing a very simple game of
chance in a historical context.
What are the key elements
we can abstract from this?
Well the idea that
you have chance experiments where
the results are not a priori determined.
Whose results are outcomes.
And so now, there's a idea of
trying to characterize completely
the possible outcomes of the experiment.
And then there are events
of interest to us,
which you could identify
with aggregates of outcomes.
And finally, there's an idea of chance,
a probability measure.
Which quantifies the chance of
a particular aggregate or event happening.
