Tableau 9, Part 1.
A first look at independence.
Probabilistic independence,
also called statistical independence
is the fundamental principle
in the Theory of Chance.
This is the principle which gives
a subject much of its color its vibrancy.
And it turns out to be subtle and deep and
informs some of the deepest
results that arise in the subject.
We shall begin our exploration of
independence in it's simplest setting,
the idea of independent events.
As always, we will begin by first looking
at simple examples to build intuition.
Much, in much of mathematics it is
true that some of the deepest and
most subtle ideas have at the heart,
elegant and simple guiding principles.
And we'll see that such is the case,
with independence.
Once we have the idea for
a concept under our belt,
our next step is to promptly
generalize and abstract the setting.
And look at it in a much more general
setting, and come up with a formal
mathematical definition of what
the object under consideration is.
We should then of course promptly explore
the mathematical nuances that result.
What are the properties?
What are the features
of such a definition?
And, make sure we understand what we've
put together, what we've cobbled together.
The next step would be to apply
the definition in settings of
more complexity, to test our
understanding of what is going on.
To bolster our intuition by stretching and
asking questions for which raw
intuition seems to be unprepared.
With that under our belt,
we will conclude by looking at more
ramifications of the definition.
So here is our game plan.
Let's promptly jump in and start by
asking what are the guiding principle
behind what we could call a mathematical
or probabilistic idea of independence.
The idea is very very simple.
It resides in the multiplicative idea
that independent possibilities multiply.
Let me take this banal trite statement and
expand it to give it some context.
So, imagine that we had an alphabet
of three letters and five numbers.
We're going to put together
letter number pairs.
How many possibilities are there?
Now, if you look at
the table we put together,
let's introduce a little bit of notation.
Let's introduce an uppercase Gothic font,
A, to represent the letters a, b, and c.
And, you can think of this as an alphabet,
a small alphabet of three letters.
And let's use an uppercase Gothic B
to represent an alphabet
now of numbers 1 through 5.
If you arrange these in a table,
letters in the rows,
numbers in the columns,
then pairs of letter number
will be represented by what
you see in the table and.
We will call the collection of letter
number pairs the Cartesian product
of A with B.
Just notation terminology.
A cross B just means all systems of pairs.
A fundamental principle of arithmetic
tells us that in the table
we have exactly 3 x 5, or 15 entries.
Thos to integrals to recognize
in multiplication table.
This is what the table of entry exists.
So if you have three possibilities for
the first alphabet a.
Five possibilities for
the second alphabet b.
There are 15 possibilities.
3 x 5 possibilities for
the pair, of A and B.
At heart, it's a very simple,
elegant, beautiful principle.
It's a basic principle of counting.
The first element is
specified independently.
I use the word in its casual or
English sense, of the second element.
What I mean by that is, the specification
of the first entry does not affect,
in no way affects,
the specification of the second entry.
If that is the case, then there
are a total of 3 x 5 possible entries.
At heart, we have a multiplication
table of possibilities.
Let us immediately put a chance context
around this very simple
elementary observation.
And naturally, inevitably,
they go back to the toss of a coin.
Let's start with a very simple
experiment where we toss a coin twice.
Before we deconstruct this,
we should, it is natural here,
of course to break up experiment into
the first toss and the second toss.
You can think of the alphabet for
the first toss,
Gothic A, to comprise,
is comprised of two symbols.
Head or tails h or T.
Similarly, the alphabet for
the second choice happens to be the same.
It's again a head or a tail.
Let's keep the letters separate for
the time being, A and B.
Right.
To give ourselves eventually the potential
for dealing with different
alphabets at different trials.
What is a sample space for the experiment?
Well, a coin is tossed twice.
Which means you have to specify
what happened in the first toss,
what happened in the second toss.
Naturally, there are four possibilities.
So the sample points are hh,
hT, Th, and TT.
Where for example, for definiteness,
we specify the results of the trials
in the order of the trial.
This, formally,
is the Cartesian product of A with B.
The system of pairs.
Let's put together some
events of interest to us.
Let us say A is the event that
the first toss resulted in a head.
Well, in terms of the sample space,
remember, an event is
a subset of the sample space.
The sample space is a Cartesian product.
It is a system of pairs.
Therefore, in that system of
pairs we identify those pairs
where the first symbol is h.
And therefore, we find that A is
comprised of two elements hh and hT.
Similarly an event B,
that a second toss results in a tail,
is comprised of two sample points,
hT and TT.
What is the probability measure?
Naturally enough, we are dealing
with a combinatorial setting,
all possibilities are equally likely,
so we deal with an atomic mass function.
Which places equal mass 1/4,
on each of the four possibilities.
Let's now do some calculations.
Of course, there's the tried and simple
example, so the calculations are easy.
The probability of A.
Well, there are two possibilities for A,
additivity tells us the chance
of A is two in four.
Or indeed as an intuitive,
natural and just, the chance of,
of a head on the first toss is 1 in 2.
The chance of a tail,
on the second toss likewise,
is 2 in 4, or again, 1 in 2.
What about the chance of the event,
A and B?
The conjunction of A and B, this
results in a head in the first trial,
a tail the second trial.
And so A intersection B is comprised of a,
a set with a single element.
A singleton.
An atom.
And that term is hT.
The probability of this
naturally is one in four.
But wait,
the one in the numerator corresponds
to selecting an h from the first alphabet
and a T from the second alphabet.
There's one way of selecting a h from hT.
There's one way of selecting an h for
a T from hT.
And therefore,
1 in the numerator is 1 times 1.
The 4 in the denominator tells
you how many ways you can say,
select the first element.
There are two ways.
Two is the size of the first alphabet.
And there are two ways of
selecting the second element.
There are two times two
ways of selecting the pair.
Alright.
This looks very trite and simple.
Which means that 1 in 4 is
the same as 1 in 2 times 1 in 2.
Identify the first half
of the probability of A.
The second half of the probability of B.
And a multiplication table is equivalent
to this rule that the probability
of A intersection B
is equal to the probability of
A times the probability of B.
We've done nothing more than
construct a multiplication table.
The language is more formal, but
at the end of it we've got an identity.
Let's hold on to this identity, and take
a look at another example in this vein.
And let's say we look at cards this time.
We're going to deal with
a standard pack of 52 cards.
Recall that in a standard pack,
cards are characterized by two features.
First, a suit.
There are four suits,
commonly called spades, hearts, diamonds,
clubs with the symbols I've shown you.
And each suit appears in thirteen ranks.
Usually called the numbers 2,
3, 4, up through 10,
together with the special letters jack,
queen, king, and ace.
The experiment at hand is, a card is
drawn randomly from a standard pack.
What is a card?
Well, a card is a pair of attributes,
a suit and a rank.
If you think of Gothic A as an alphabet
of suits, Gothic B as an alphabet
of 13 ranks,
then a card is an element in A cross B.
You specify the suit and the rank.
You can make things a little more complex,
it, it appears to be a little more
burdensome than is needed, but this kind
of abstraction will set the stage for
a gentle definition, so bear with me.
Okay.
So drawing a card means drawing a suit and
a rank.
Let's put together some events.
Let A be the event that
the card drawn is a spade.
Remember an event is a subset
of the sample space, so
you're going to have to
give me a subset of pairs.
Which subset?
Well, the first element has to be a spade.
The second element can be any
of the thirteen ranks, and
so you list all 13 possibilities and
this gives you the spade suit.
That is your everyday.
Let B be the event.
Now, the card drawn is an ace.
Again it's a subset of the sample set,
which subset of pairs?
Well, the second element has to be an ace,
but
the first element can
be anything you like.
It can be any of the four suits.
Good, now we've got B.
What is the probability measure?
Naturally enough,
again we have a combinatorial setting,
we are looking at the simplest
cases to build intuition.
Every card has an equal probability of
being drawn, so if you're looking at
an atomic measure which places mass 1/52,
on each item, on each card.
Good.
Very quickly,
now let's compute probabilities.
What are the chances of A?
[SOUND] Very quickly.
A has got 13 elements in it.
The chance of A is 13 and 52 or 1 in 4.
What about the chance of B?
Well, B has got four elements in it.
The chance of B is 4 in 52 or 1 in 13.
What about the chance of A intersection B?
But what is A intersection B?
That means that a card drawn is first an,
a spade and second an ace.
But there is precisely one card in the
intersection, which is the ace of spades.
And therefore the probability
of A intersection B is 1 in 52.
Elementary simple.
But, pause for a moment.
Let's pass the numerator and
the denominator on the right.
The 1 in the numerator represents all
the outcomes that are favorable for
the event A intersection B.
How do you stitch an,
a favorable event together?
Well, this means that,
in the first draw if you like,
from the first alphabet you drew a spade.
And in the second draw from
the second alphabet you drew an ace.
There is precisely one spade
in the alphabet Gothic A.
There's precisely one ace
in the alphabet Gothic B.
Therefore one is decomposes one times one.
These are real products.
Elementary and simple.
What about 52?
Well, there are four elements in
the first alphabet of, of suits.
And 13 elements in the second
alphabet of ranks.
So 52 is naturally 4 x 13.
And therefore, 1 over 52 can be
decomposed into a product again,
of one fourths times one thirteenths.
Identify the first of those
probabilities with a probability of A.
The second with a probability of B, and
again, we've discovered
a rule of products.
The probability of A intersection B is
equal to the probability of A times
the probability of B.
A student may justly complain that I'm
making a mountain out of a mole hill.
You put all this elaboration in there
to discover a multiplication table.
But this simple idea is at
the heart of a generic principle.
And this we will turn to next.
