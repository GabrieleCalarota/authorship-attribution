Before we do an analysis right,
let me indulge myself by
looking at certain violations
of the rules of engagement and
this was beautifully articulated by T.W.
Korner at Oxford University.
That was sloppy.
This is I think unarguable at
least in this paper, okay?
And how was he sloppy?
Well he's violated certain
fundamental rules.
The first fundamental rule is to provide
details of your experimental procedure.
Today if a scientist goes into a lab,
she will take a lab notebook and
will jot down everything,
all the details of the procedure.
Why?
So that a reader evaluating
the results can judge for
herself the reliability of the data
collection and whether it is reproducible.
Of course, this reproducibility is at
the heart of scientific investigation.
And if one doesn't provide details of how
experiments were done, then of course,
nothing is reproducible.
So, clearly this was sloppy.
Second, according to Korner,
one should endeavor to always
present unvarnished data.
Just the facts ma'am, nothing else.
Why?
So that the reader can judge for
herself whether the analysis was sound,
can in fact do the analysis for
herself as a sanity check to what is
actually reported by the investigator.
Three, there are sometimes good and
necessary reasons to massage data,
to process it.
For example, there might be
known cases of outliers way out
there which distort the rest of the data.
Those are experimental aberrations.
And so it might make all kinds
of things to eliminate, eschew,
cut out, expurgate, these stray,
extraneous observations.
But if that is done or
the data are massaged in any other way,
then it is incumbent upon the investigator
to provide the details of what is done.
Explain the mechanism.
And, present this side by
side with the original data.
So that again,
the reader can make up her own mind
as to whether the process, the mechanism
of massaging the data, was sound.
Whether this was appropriate.
And finally, can I suggest an aphorism
which here also Riley points out,
is perhaps beyond the moral
strength of most of us.
And which is to wit, do not conceal
the weaknesses of your own arguments and
do not ignore strong points
over opposing points of view.
I will get to the analysis very, very
briefly, but I can't resist as Korner did,
with a very small,
historical digression, right?
Korner points out that one
reason that Darwin was so
persuasive is that a reading
of The Origin of Species
brings to the fore a quite
remarkable transparent honesty.
It is very rare that a scientist
goes out of his way,
almost to point out
weaknesses in his theory.
This was a man who collected
data over his life.
And this was his life work,
The Origin of Species.
And in a reading of it you find that he
points out difficulties with the theory,
places where the theory can break.
For example, the Theory of Evolution
requires extraordinary long time scales,
on the order of hundreds actually,
thousands of millions of years,
billions of years.
But this ran counter to
a historical tradition which
had imagined that the Earth was very young
in historical terms, a few thousand years.
More blows were dealt to,
to Darwin's theory, even from science,
from thermodynamics.
Early calculations based on a, an inert
cooling body due to, to Lord Kelvin.
Surges to the Earth was perhaps no
more than 100 million years, or
in a refinement of their, calculation
perhaps no more than 50 million years old.
And Darwin pointed out that was
much too little for his theory.
He was almost willing to abandon
the theory if that were true.
You just imagine, the,
the intestinal fortitude,
the honesty required to be able to
walk away from a life's work at need.
And other areas where the theory
had potential holes was
that a hereditary mechanism was
pre supposed based upon the data
that organisms passed on
features to their progeny.
But Darwin had no clue
what the mechanism was.
He posited the existence
of a mysterious mechanism
without knowing what it could be.
And in many ways,
as the century progressed
on into the 20th century and beyond, and
more and more data were accumulated,
and more and more of these questions
that Darwin raised were answered.
The age of the earth was answered by the
discovery of radioactive emission, a new
source of energy which pushed back the age
of the earth back to between four and
five billion years, more than enough for
Darwinian evolution.
The discovery that hereditary
mechanisms were encoded
in our genetic structure came much later.
And all of these lead
triumphant validation
to this most glorious of theories.
There is perhaps no other
scientific theory which has had so
much experiment of validation.
Here is an autobiographical quote from
Darwin that I cannot resist giving you.
And, I'm going to read it to you.
He said, I had during many
years followed a golden rule,
namely that whenever a published fact,
a new observation or
thought came across me which was
opposed to my general results,
to make a memorandum of it
without fail and at once.
For I had found my experience
that such facts and thoughts were
far more apt to escape from
memory than favorable ones.
And it is perhaps this
transparency of thought,
this transparent honesty
which has ultimately led to
such a strong persuasive acceptance of the
Darwinian theories of Natural Selection.
But we are digressing.
Let's go back to the question
of Sir Robert and
now let's take a look at the data.
Yes, they were sloppily presented but that
does not mean that fraud was committed.
Let us see what mathematics
can tell us on this score.
