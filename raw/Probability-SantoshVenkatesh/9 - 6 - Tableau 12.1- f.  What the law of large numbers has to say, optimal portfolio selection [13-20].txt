We now have a beguilingly
simple description of
the growth wealth after n days of trading.
The description is in terms
of an exponent, delta n
which looks complex but
is an arithmetic average.
It looks like a sample mean.
You remember the duck which has
frequently crossed our paths.
All right.
If it walks like a duck, if it quacks
like a duck, it looks like a duck.
If it walks like a sample mean,
if it quacks like a sample mean,
it looks like a sample mean.
The moment we have something
like an arithmetic average,
a sample mean,
we immediately think about concentration.
We have a law of large numbers.
But of course, for
this to work, we've going to now have
to flesh out an underlying chance law.
So, let's put in place a sanitized
structure for an idealized stock market.
Let us suppose we have
a stochastically stationary market,
in other words the stock
price relatives day to day
are governed independently
by an underlying chance law.
In other words, the individual stock
price relatives X1, X2, X3, for
day one, day two, day three, and so
forth are independent of each other.
They connote independent trials from
a common underlying distribution.
Let's say the poster child for
that is a stock price relative
X drawn according to a law.
Bear in mind, I am not saying
that on a given day's trading,
the movement of a stock
cannot effect another stock.
Yes, indeed it can.
For example, on a given day if
the tech sector is doing well,
then your anticipated technology
stocks pull each other up.
Whereas if let's say the medical sector,
the pharmaceutical sector is doing poorly,
you might anticipate that pharmaceutical
stocks pull each other down.
They could well be dependencies
in the movements between stocks.
What we are saying though is
that on a day to day basis,
the entire ensemble of movements
combine repeated independent trials.
Within the day the stock market movements
could well be dependent
in very complicated ways.
Of course that'll have to be captured
by an underlying probability law or
a distribution, which now really is
a distribution in an m dimensional space.
So, potentially very complex.
This is a highly sanitized view of
the stock market because, of course to say
that the distribution of
the chance law governing the stock
price relatives, is independent from day
to day, seems to be overtly simplistic.
So, but bear with me.
We have to start somewhere after all, and
this is the simplest
setting we could look at.
So this is what we call
a stochastically stationary market.
In other words, the stock price relatives
day-to-day are independent trials.
Now the moment of independent trials,
the wealth relatives for
the given choice of portfolio
a are now prescribed the moment you
tell me what these stock
relatives x's are.
So the wealth relative forward after
day one is S of X1 what we call S1.
The wealth relative after day two,
is XS of X2 what we call S2, so on.
But X1, X2, X3, and so
forth are independent trials and
therefore their wealth relatives
that are engendered by these trials.
S1, S2, S3, through Sn,
are also independent trials with some
complex underlying distribution.
But if the wealth relatives S1, S2,
S3 from day to day are constituting
independent trials,
then the logarithms of them
are also independent trials.
And therefore yeah,
is a fundamental realization.
The algorithms of the wealth ratios,
day to day, constitutes
a sequence of repeated independent trials
with an underlying common distribution.
Potentially very complex,
potentially engendered ultimately by
the probability law which governs
the stock price relatives day to day.
But, in principle you've got
a sequence of independent trials
with some complicated
underlying distribution.
An actual question then to ask is,
what is its expectation?
So, let's take a typical such trial,
governed by that distribution, and
look at the expectation of the logarithm
of the wealth relative for a given day.
The expectation of a logarithm of S,
for a generic X,
the expectation of
the logarithm of S of X.
Let's pause and take a good,
long look at this.
We have now reduced the problem to
a sequence of repeated independent trials.
These trials can note that a logarithm
of the wealth ratios day by day.
The expectation of this,
now depends only on two things.
One, what were the underlying chance law,
for this stock price relatives exist?
That's potentially very complex, but
it's effects distribution in this model.
And that distribution is
not varied from day to day.
And second, it depends only
on the particular portfolio of wealth
distribution that we are using.
The constantly rebalanced portfolio A.
So if you assume that
the underlying chance law for
the stock price relatives as
something fixed but unknown,
at the end of the day the expectation of
the logarithm of the wealth relatives
is determined solely by
the choice of portfolio.
Let's call it delta of a.
And, here's now our realization.
We've got a sequence of repeated
independent trials with expectation,
delta, depending only on the choice of a.
What is delta sub n?
It is a sample mean of these trials.
It is the arithmetic average of
the logarithm of the wealth ratios.
And in one fell swoop the law
of large numbers tells us that
delta of n is concentrated asymptotically
for large enough values of n.
At its expected value, delta determined
solely by the fixed choice of portfolio a.
In other words, delta sub a behaves for
all intents and
purposes, as if it were a constant.
This is a magic of
the law of large numbers.
A very chance driven entity,
opting by a myriad of chance fluctuations,
when suitably average,
behaves in essence like a constant.
Of course,
we could dress up this raw statement,
by putting in place error tolerances and
confidences,
and then we have a formal statement
of the law of large numbers.
But once we've understood what the law
of large numbers is saying, then
we could capture all of this by simply
saying delta of n behaves like a constant.
It behaves like delta of a,
a fixed number determined solely by a.
And let's capture all of this verbiage
in short by simply introducing some new
notation.
Let us simply write Delta sub
n is equal to with a little
dot on top of the equal sign, a constant.
Of course delta of n is not
actually equal to a constant.
Delta n on one hand is a chance variable.
The constant is determined
solely by the portfolio A.
But the law of large numbers tells us
that with very high probability, delta of
n is going to be very close to delta of a.
Delta of N behaves like a constant.
And with this in hand,
our growth of wealth takes on
an even simpler mean,
an even simpler cost.
After n days of trading, with a constantly
rebalanced portfolio, assuming
that we have a stochastically stationary
market of repeated independent trials for
the stock price relatives, wealth grows
essentially as if it were constant.
It'll behave es, essentially like 2 to
the power n times a constant delta over a.
And now we can interpret
what that constant is.
1 over delta over a,
represents the number of days needed for
you to double your wealth, of course
this is if delta of a is positive.
Of course there's a possibility
that delta of a is negative
because you see in there that a logarithm
could be negative or positive.
So an expected value could give
rise to a negative number.
What does a negative value for
delta of a portend?
It means that wealth is
decreasing exponentially.
And then delta of a is then,
represents the halving ratio.
We'll simply give it all one name.
We'll say that delta of a is
the doubling rate for portfolio a.
Bear in mind ff delta a is positive,
this tells you the rate
at which wealth doubles.
If delta of a is negative it tells
you the rate at which wealth halves.
Of course we are hoping that we're dealing
with a market which is a bull market.
The delta of a is positive
even by a slight amount.
What this tells us is this.
If the doubling rate for
portfolio A, delta of a, is positive
even by a smidgen then wealth will
grow exponentially at that rate.
But if it is sadly negative
even by a small amount,
then wealth will decrease
exponentially at that rate.
Naturally enough, we're in this business
to try to make money, not lose it.
And so, we would like to ensure
that the doubling rate is positive.
How do we do that?
Well, we have room to play.
We can fiddle with the portfolio.
And so we want to consider
the class of portfolios for
which the doubling rate is positive.
And if we can find any such portfolio,
then we will very rapidly
accumulate wealth at an exponential
rate in this highly sanitized model.
But of course, we are greedy.
We not only to accumulate wealth,
we want to accumulate wealth fast.
So this leads to a question of how
should one select the best portfolio?
What is an optimal portfolio?
And our interpretation now of delta of n
has essentially been given by a constant
doubling rate.
Makes clear what we have to do.
We have to make the exponent
as big as possible.
And so, here is a slogan.
We should select that portfolio,
call it a star,
which maximizes the doubling
rate delta of a.
The moment you chose such a portfolio,
then that portfolio will engender
a doubling rate, call it delta star.
This is delta of the optimal portfolio,
a star.
This is the maximum of the doubling
rate over all possible portfolios.
This is the optimal
doubling rate of wealth.
And so Delta star tells us, for
a given underlying chance law
governing stock price relatives,
what the best allocation
of resources is and
how fast wealth will grow if
one allocates it in accordance
with those principles.
But of course,
you should bear in mind that this is
a highly sanitized view of reality.
The real stock market, sadly, does not
conform to all our simple assumptions.
So we should end with a disclaimer.
