Now that we've come to a right
understanding of how to categorize
the time of the first arrival,
it is now time to turn to
the arrival process as a whole.
So, we now have, except sequence arrivals,
arriving at random points in time,
to categorize Poisson's process.
Our analysis of the first arrival at
the time of first arrival, points the way.
Let us look at this sequence
of inter-arrival times.
Where, let's say that X1 is a time
to the first arrival, as before.
Let X2 denote the time between
the first and second arrivals.
X3, the duration between the second and
third arrivals, and so on down.
Xn for an arbitrary positive
integer n representing
the duration between the n minus 1 nth and
the nth arrivals.
Okay, our now job now is to categorize a
distribution of these inter-arrival times.
Let's begin with a key observation
that we already have under our belt.
The first arrival is categorized by
an exponential distribution.
Now, the key element here,
the key observation here,
is that the Poisson process
has independent increments.
And what does that mean?
It means that the number of
arrivals in a given interval is
independent of the number of arrivals in
any interval disjoint from the first.
And therefore, the moment we look at
the first arrival, from that point on,
given that the first arrival has
occurred somewhere, from that point on,
the time to the next arrival is
independent of what transpired earlier.
This is the independent
increment property.
And immediately, into our laps,
will fall this following idea.
Every arrival constitutes
a renewal of the process.
It's as if we'd begun anew.
And therefore,
the time between the first and
second arrivals has the same distribution
as the time of the first arrival.
It's exponentially distributed
with its same parameter alpha.
And the moment a second
arrival comes into place,
the third arrival is independent of
the first two, and the inter-arrival
time makes three has got the same
distribution as X1 and X2, and so forth.
And so, what have we discovered?
The sample points of the Poisson
process are characterized
by this infinite sequence
of inter-arrival times.
And this infinite sequence of
chance driven inter-arrival times
represent independent trials.
Each with a common underlying
exponential distribution
characterized for the first arrival.
And there you have it.
This, now, is the underlying sample
space for this rich problem.
