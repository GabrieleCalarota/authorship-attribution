So, let's start with
a very simple example.
Let's go back to a ball metaphor.
Let's say we have five balls.
I've given you five different colors.
Or, you could just as well call
them five letters a through e, or
give them any other names you care to.
The semantics of the problem
are of no interest to us.
It is a numerical count that matters.
Right, as I said,
the semantics add color to the problem but
don't add to it's logical content.
So, I have five balls.
How many different ways can
we split these five balls,
these five objects, into two groups?
One subpopulation with two elements and
another subpopulation with three elements.
So for example let's say we pick
our favorite peach, green, and
purple balls from this collection of five.
Now here's one group of three,
notice that we have implicitly
specified the remaining elements.
The blue and the red balls are the ones
which are in the other group.
So it, it suffices already to specify
one of the two sub-populations.
The other is implicitly specified
if you know the whole population.
Now, look at this
particular subpopulation.
Peach, green, purple.
The order does not matter.
But if we ordered them
we could specify them,
say lexicographically,
in six different ways.
And here's all these orderings.
Now, the moral of the story is this.
For every particular collection
of three balls, there are six
distinguished orderings creating
ordered samples of these three balls.
Now the general principle
then becomes much clearer.
How do we back to doing this in general?
Well, it'll be convenient to go ahead and
abstract out the colors.
The colors are nice,
they're visually attractive but
they get in the way of a formal
appreciation of what's going on.
Let's replace the balls by letters and
if we did that then we have a setting
where you replace the 3 balls and
their particular arrangements by
populations and ordered samples.
So, you will get a subpopulation a, c,
d corresponding to the green ball, the
purple ball, and the peach-colored ball.
And the ordered sample on
your left tells you all
arrangements of these three objects.
At the high level, what you've got is
one subpopulation of three elements
to which we have six
distinguished ordered samples.
It is clear now that every
subpopulation of three elements
has a distinguished collection of
six orderings in an ordered sample.
And therefore the number of different
subpopulations you could engender,
multiplied by six, or
more precisely in our context,
three factorial, will give us all
the possible ways of engendering a,
an ordered sample of size three where
sampling is without replacement.
Remember inside a set
an object can not be repeated.
Now let's do this again.
Every sub population of size
three in genders in ordered
distinguished sample of six
different possibilities.
Therefore the number of different ways in
which you could engender a population,
a sub population of size three.
If you multiply that number by six,
you must get
all possible ways of specifying three
distinct elements without repetition.
Very good.
If that is the case then very simply
the number of distinguished subpopulations
of size three from the population
of size five is obtained first
by looking at all possible ordered samples
of size three without replacement.
This annotation is five
to the three falling.
And divide that by the repetition,
this factor six or three factorial.
Of course, this simplifies.
Five times four times three
divided by six, and this is ten.
But the actual answer is not
particularly germane for our purposes.
The logical idea behind the construction
of the answer is what is relevant.
Now, this is a slightly more complex
object than what we've seen hitherto, but
it's not very hard.
It counts a total number of samples and
divides by a repetition factor.
This is a number of subpopulations.
We give this a special name.
And this name is a famous
name historically.
It's called the binomial coefficient.
We call this interminology.
Five chose three.
We represent it by writing a five
on top and a three below and
enclose the whole in round brackets.
That entire object on the left is
called the binomial coefficient.
Again we say it enwords 5 choose 3.
And the terminology exposes the mechanism
of what it is we are doing.
There are 5 objects in the population,
and we are selecting 3.
5, choose 3.
This is a famous historical object.
In fact this particular
object was at the heart of
Isaac Newton's discovery of the calculus,
but more on that later.
Now once we have this idea,
this principle in mind, we should very
quickly extrapolate, generalize, and come
up with a general answer for this problem.
So let's go back now to a general,
generic population of n elements.
Again, let's say a one through a n.
The, what these objects are,
are not germaine.
They can, they could be balls.
They could be colors.
They could be numbers.
They could be letters.
It is immaterial.
All that is material, that is germane,
is that there are n distinguished
elements in your population.
From these you wish to select
a subpopulation of k elements.
Remember a subpopulation means that no
element can be repeated, it is a set.
How do we do this?
Well exactly the same
way we did this before.
Specify all ordered sequences,
samples of size K without replacement.
That is going to give
us N to the k falling.
But then there's going to be
an over counting because of
all these permutations of every
particular sub, subpopulation.
Our k factorial permutations divide
by k factorial and that is exactly
is going to be the number of ways in
which you can select k objects out of n.
N choose k.
Just as in the case of a factorial
we like to make provision for
when one or more of the index
terms are identically zero.
So as a matter of convention
we say that n chose zero is
identically one for
all non negative integers n.
Again, this is a matter of convention and
it smooths calculations
as we move forward.
It'll be consistent with the analysis for
when things are non trivial
