We are now interested in trying to analyze
what one can say about the growth or
the diminution of wealth over a succession
of investments according
to a given portfolio.
So bear in mind, the portfolio at
hand is a vector of possibilities,
a distribution of wealth
across various stocks.
We're dealing with a constantly
rebalanced portfolio,
where at the end of each day's
trading we reappropriate wealth so
that the proportions the various stocks
fit the prescription of the portfolio.
The progression of wealth is governed
by the stock price relatives for
each trading day.
So for day n, we have a stock price
relative vector X with a superscript n.
Which tell you how much stocks,
individual stocks, have gone up or
down in each of those stocks.
The wealth relative at the close
of a given day, say, n,
tells us how much one dollar
invested at the end of the previous
day's trading will have made at
the end of the current day's trading.
And finally, the growth of wealth,
starting with an initial wealth W0,
which we shall take to be 1, is governed
by a simple recursive equation.
Wn, the wealth at the end
of day end's trading,
is given by the wealth at the end
of the previous day's trading,
Wn minus 1,
times the wealth relative for day n.
Now, we really can't ask for
a much simpler characterization of
what's happening to the investment.
But of course,
we realize that the wealth relatives,
S1, S2, S3, through Sn,
are all chance driven.
And so, of course,
this is now a chance driven entity.
Can you say anything reasonable about it?
So, we begin the analysis by
setting up a simple inductive step,
and we try to work it
through step by step.
We know what the wealth is at
the close of trading on day n in
terms of the wealth at the close
of trading on day n minus 1.
What can we say about the wealth at
the close of trading day n minus 1?
Well, of course,
the same recursive equation tells us,
it is related to the wealth at
the close of trading on day n minus 2,
modulated by the wealth relative for
day n minus 1.
Or in other words, we can decompose Wn
minus 1 into Wn minus 2 times Sn minus 1.
And now,
we've got a slightly longer equation.
But, the wealth at the close of trading on
day n minus 2 can be related to the wealth
at the close of trading on day n minus
3 by looking one more day in the past.
And now,
our equation expands a little further.
And now, the pattern becomes clear.
We're going to inductively step
through one day at a time,
going back into the past,
until we end up with day 0.
And each day we go back,
we incorporate one more wealth
relative for that day into a product.
And so, at the end,
we relate the wealth at the end of day
n to the starting wealth,
W0, by a simple product.
The wealth at day n is going
by the initial wealth times
the individual wealth relatives for
each day.
For simplicity, let's assume we
have an initial wealth W0 of 1.
Right, if we had some other wealth,
it's just going to multiply everything
by whatever the initial wealth was.
So, if our initial investment was 1 unit,
distributed according to a portfolio a,
then after n days of trading,
our wealth will have become
the product of the wealth relatives S1,
S2, S3, through Sn.
One could hardly ask for a simpler
expression on the right hand side.
Or could one?
If one were to quibble at all,
it is because the expression
on the right is a product.
It's a product of chance driven entities.
And products are nice and elegant and
fairly simple to describe, but
we might worry that handling a product
is a lot harder than handling a sum.
Wouldn't it be nice if instead
of a product on the right,
we actually had a sum?
How can one convert a product into a sum?
We scratch our heads and we say,
well, an atavistic tug at a memory,
from our first days of calculus,
tell us, wait a minute,
the logarithmic function has
exactly the desired property.
The logarithm of a product
is a sum of logarithms.
And so, if I were to take a logarithm of
the right hand side, I would get a sum.
That leaves us one more question.
The logarithm could be
to any base whatsoever.
What is a reasonable base?
We shall choose 2 as
the base of the logarithm,
because as we shall see shortly,
it's going to give us a very clean and
intuitive description of
what is happening to wealth.
So accordingly, let us take the logarithm
base 2 of the product on the right.
But of course, we can't simply cavalierly
take a logarithm of something on the right
and preserve equality.
To undo the logarithm, we're to put the
logarithm in the exponent of a power of 2.
And now we see,
all we've done is rewritten a product as 2
to the power of log base 2 of the product.
But now, the magic of the logarithm says,
the logarithm of a product
is a sum of logarithms.
And therefore, without further ado,
in the exponent,
I will get 2 to a power
of a sum of logarithms.
Each of the logarithms is
a logarithm base 2 of,
bear in mind, of these wealth ratios.
So, we have the logarithm base 2 of S1,
the wealth ratio,
the amount wealth has increased
proportionately over the course of day 1.
The proportional increase of
wealth over day 2 is S2, and
we have logarithm base 2 of S2,
and so on down.
So now we've got a sum of logarithms, and
this is promising because we
know how to deal with sums.
One more step of simplification,
or at least clarification.
We have a sum of n entities,
admittedly looking complex and messy.
Well, it would be natural then to
consider what happens to the average,
the arithmetic average, of such a sum.
In other words,
what happens if we divided by n?
That gives us the average change,
the average logarithm, of a wealth ratio.
Of course, I can't simply divide
by n if I don't multiply by n.
And so, here is an identity.
The wealth at the end of day n's
trading is given by a power of 2.
And in the exponent,
I get n times an arithmetic average.
Let's promptly give it a name.
Let's call that arithmetic
average delta sub n.
All right, and now we've got a clean,
elegant description of what
is happening to wealth.
The wealth after n days of trading,
starting from a unit wealth,
apportioned daily in a constantly
rebalanced portfolio, a,
is 2 to the power n times delta of n.
And what is delta of n?
It's an arithmetic average of
the logarithms of wealth ratios.
This is a beautiful, clean,
and elegant description, and
now we are essentially home free.
This will be our next subject.
