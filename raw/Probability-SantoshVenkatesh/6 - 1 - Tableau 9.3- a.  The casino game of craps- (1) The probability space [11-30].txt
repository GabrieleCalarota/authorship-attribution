Tableau nine, part three,
independence, warp and
the woof of the fabric of chance.
I am being a little whimsical here,
indulging in a metaphor from fabrics and
textiles.
The warp and the woof refers to
the threads that run across a fabric.
And in a very real sense,
the idea of independence is a scale or
a thread that runs through
the entire theory of chance.
Understanding independence
properly allows us,
opens a door into manifold applications
and a richer understanding of the theory.
So, thus far we've built up a formal
idea of what independence means and
we've seen how independence can arise
in situations where there are repeated
independent trials.
In this lecture, we will move on and
look at three settings,
rich, interesting, applicable widely,
and where independence arises,
sometimes subtly, sometimes overtly.
And we shall see the consequences
are profound and
significant in their own right.
So, without further ado,
let's begin with our first application,
an application in gambling,
the casino game of craps.
Now, this is an old friend.
We've seen the game of craps introduced
in tableau three, part three.
And so, let us refresh our memory
as to the structure of this game.
Now admittedly this is a dice game where
one repeatedly throws a pair of dice,
but the rules are arcane,
peculiar, singular.
The way this game functions
is one throws a pair of dice,
looks at the face values and sums them.
If the sum of the face values is a 2 or
a 3 or a 12 then you lose immediately.
If the sum of the face values happens
to be 7 or 11 then you win immediately.
It gets interesting if the sum of face
values is one of the remaining numbers,
4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10.
In that case the game progresses by
repeatedly throwing this pair of dice and
summing the face values.
And stopping at the first
moment when either the first
thrown number is replicated or
a 7 is thrown.
If you're lucky enough to replicate
what you first threw, you win.
If you have the misfortune
of throwing a 7, you lose.
Strange, peculiar.
Now, we saw by an elementary
analysis that the chances of winning
on the first throw, that is to
say the chance of throwing a 7 or
an 11 is twice that of
losing on the first throw.
That is to say throwing a 2 or
a 3 or a 12.
Does that suggest that the introvert
gambler is justified in going forward and
playing this game?
Or not so
hasty we should do an analysis and
understand what happens
in the remaining cases.
So let us go back and put together
a probability space for this problem.
The fundamental question, of course,
is what is the probability
that a gambler will win
in a game of craps?
The reader who does not recall how we
put together the probability space
might want to take a break and go back to
tableau three, part three and reconstruct
the sample space for this experiment, but
to summarize here are the selling points.
For each throw of the pair of dice,
we're going to sum the face values, and
the residual experiment
then can be thought of,
as having an alphabet of
the numbers 2 through 12.
And we've seen that the appropriate
probability measure, the atomic measure,
attached to each of these possibilities
is 1 in 36 for 2, 2 in 36 for
3, 3 in 36 for 4 and so
on with 6 in 36 for 7.
And the probabilities decreasing at pace,
5 in 36,
4 in 36 and back down to 1 in 36 for 12.
Now what is the sample space for
this conjoined experiment?
And clearly here we have a setting where
we have repeated independent trials.
Each throw is independent of the previous
throw, with a termination condition,
these are the peculiar rules of the game.
So, let's start with a sample space.
It is clear that one way of
engendering a sample point is to
throw one of the numbers,
2, 3, 12, or 7, 11.
So, the single letters, 1, 2, 12, 7 or
11 constitute a bona-fide
sample points of experiment.
But if one throws 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or
10, then the experiment continues.
And we get a succession,
a sequence of numbers.
Let's say the game is continued in
this latter case, through n trials,
we then obtain a succession,
a sequence of numbers, k1,
k2, k3, through k sub n,
where n is 2 or larger.
And k1 is one of the numbers 4,
5, 6, 8, 9, or 10.
And the remaining numbers
are specified as follows,
the final number kn has to be
either a starting number k1 or 7.
In the former case you win,
in the latter case you will lose.
The numbers which are sandwiched
in-between these bookend numbers k1 and
kn, the numbers k2 through
kn minus 1 have all to be
any of the numbers excepting
the original number k1, or 7.
All such sequences constitute valid,
bona-fide sample points of the experiment.
And the sample space,
then, is a collection of those single
numbers and all such valid sequences.
Excellent, now we understand
what this sample space is,
what the probability game is.
What are the events of interest to us?
Well naturally enough, the primary event
of interest to us, is that we win.
Let's call this event W.
W then, is a subset of the sample points.
What are the sample points that trigger W?
What are the sample points
that are favorable for W?
Well W certainly includes
the single letters 7 and 11.
If you throw 7 or
11 on the first try you win.
W also includes all sequences
k1 through kn where k1 is
one of the six numbers 4,
5, 6, 8, 9 or 10.
Kn is the same as k1.
And the numbers k2 through kn minus 1 and
between can be neither k1 nor 7.
All such subsequences will then trigger
the event that you win the event W.
Of course this is a subset
of the sample space.
The probability measure is
a natural probability measure
obtained as a product measure.
We simply multiply atomic probabilities.
Now before we get any
further we should pause to
examine the problem to understand
what it is made up of.
It is never wise to jump into
an analysis without first understanding
what the structure of the problem is.
Here we have a problem
with many possible steps,
the steps are guided by the first step.
This brings to mind a very simple
partition that we've encountered before.
This is the principle of Lao Tzu,
a long journey of a thousand
miles begins with a single step.
We've seen an invocation
of this principle earlier
when we talked about the ballot problem.
We conditioned, we partitioned the space
by looking at what happened in
the last step of the count.
Now here is a problem where the first step
is peculiarly interesting and informative.
Accordingly, let's start with our
first guiding principle of additivity,
a partition of the space based upon
the very first step in the sequence.
Write F2, for the event,
that the first throw results in a 2,
F3 for the event that the first
row results in a 3, and so
on, Fk representing the event,
that the first row results in a number k,
k running between 2 and 12.
It is clear that the first throw has to
result in some number from 2 through 12.
It's also clear that you can't have two
possible numbers from the first throw.
The event Fk, the event F2 through
F12 partition the sample space.
It's a beautiful, elegant, and
simple understanding of how
does gamers proceeding.
But there's one more partition which is,
baked into the cake, as it were.
Let's pause and think about what is
the essential nature of the sample point.
True, the sample points are determined
by what happened first, but
there's something else at play here.
The sample points themselves
could constitute sequences
of trials terminating at
some specific kind of trial.
The moment one has a sequence
that suggests that winning or
losing can be broken down in to winning or
losing after a certain number of steps,
so suppose we win,
well we could win on the first trial or
the second or the third and so on.
Let us now takes talk of
this understanding and
create a little more notation.
In a natural notation let us write
W with a subscript n to connote
the event, that you win at the nth trial.
n, of course, can run through the
introduced 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so forth.
If you win at all, you're going to
have to win at some trial, and
so the events W sub n,
W1, W2, W3, and so forth,
partition the event W into disjoint or
mutually exclusive pieces.
Now these two realizations coupled with
an underlying appeal to independence,
to the product measure will wrap
everything up beautifully and delicately.
