Thus far, we have looked at independence
in the case of two events, and
a multiplication rule, a rule of products.
Independence in the case
of three events and
now a family of multiplication
rules looking at various slices.
Two intersections at a time,
three intersections.
We're not ready for
an abstract general definition
which captures the key ideas
that we have discovered so far.
So, in our general setting, which promptly
consider a general finite family of
events, or more generally,
a countably infinite family of events.
What does the key principle say?
That if you look at a family of events, we
want the rule of products manifested for
intersection probabilities for
every finite subgroup.
Let us capture this in a short compact
mathematical description and then
we shall flesh it out so that we see
exactly what the definition entails.
But here, independence ultimately
is a rule of products.
Independent possibilities multiply
whichever way we assemble them.
So, let's begin.
Let us say A1, A2, A3, A4 and so forth,
is a generic family either finite or
possibly even countably
infinite of events.
We will see that such a family
of events is independent.
If and only if, for
every finite subset of integer indices,
let's use blackboard
bold j to represent them.
So J, blackboard bold,
represents a subset of positive integers.
For example, 1 and 2 or 3, 7 and 9 or
any other collection of integers.
For every such collection of
blackboard bold j integers,
we require that the associated
events satisfy a rule of products.
The probability of
the intersection of those events,
specified by the index
set blackboard bold j,
is given by a product of
the probabilities of exactly those.
All right.
This is, has a great virtue of being
nice and compact as a description.
But of course, we pay a price for
compaction in that.
It is not completely clear perhaps
exactly what all of this entails.
So let's flesh it out, and
see exactly what the definition is saying.
'Kay?
Our definition means the following,
pick a family of events A sub j,
j running through either a finite or
an infinite range.
The events are independent means
that pick any positive integer k.
Pick any collection of indices of k
indices from your collection say j1,
j2, j3 and so on, jk.
Pick k indices.
Look at the events Aj1,
Aj2, Aj3, and so on, Ajk.
Look at the probability of
the intersection of all those k events.
That intersection probability must be the
product of the individual probabilities.
And this statement must hold for
every choice of k and
for every collection of k indices
that you select from a group.
Let's flesh it out one more time.
This means, if for
example k is 2, that A1 and
A2 intersected have a rule of products.
A 1 and
A3 intersected have a rule of products.
A 1 and A4 intersected have
a rule of products, and so on.
A 2 and
A3 intersected satisfy a rule of products.
A2 and A4 intersected satisfy
a rule of products and so on.
A3 intersected with A4 satisfies
the rule of products and so on.
In other words, all pairwise intersections
possible, from mere finite or
countably infinite family,
must satisfy a rule of products.
Every pair of events must
be pairwise independent.
But that's not enough.
Once you exhausted all possible pairs, and
there could be an infinity of them,
we now look at all possible triples.
A1, A2 and A3 intersected must
satisfy a rule of products.
A1, A2 and A4 intersected must
satisfy a rule of products, and so on.
A2, A3, A4 intersected must satisfy
a rule of products and so on.
All conceivable triples intercepted,
intersected must satisfy
a rule of products.
But that's not enough.
All quadruple intersections must
satisfy the rule of products.
All quintuple intersections must
satisfy the rule of products.
In fact, a rule of products must be
satisfied for every finite subgrouping.
This is a formidable number of conditions.
How on earth are we going to check whether
a large family is actually independent.
If we were to check each of these by turn,
laboriously,
we would very quickly give up.
Fortunately, in the simplest and most
commonly occurring of the settings where
independence comes into play, we will
find that independence falls into a lap.
Meaning, that all these
conditions are tightly and
transparently satisfy with
the necessity of no checks whatsoever.
This is a setting of independent
trials and we will come to this next.
