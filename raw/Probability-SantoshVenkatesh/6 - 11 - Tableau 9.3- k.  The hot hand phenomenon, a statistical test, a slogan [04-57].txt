The listener will recall our
introductory topic where we
discussed the phenomena of
the hot hand in sports.
For definiteness we focused on basketball.
Consider a player who historically makes
one basket out of every
two shots that he takes.
During the course of the game, he goes on
a run, and he makes five baskets in a row.
And we conclude that he has a hot hand.
He cannot miss.
As we discussed, there are two
possibilities in front of us.
The first,
goes along with conventional wisdom.
To it, that, if a basketball player
who is traditionally a 50% shooter,
making one out of two baskets, goes on
a streak and hits five baskets in a row.
Now five baskets in
a row would be unusual,
the chances of that
should be about 1 in 32.
If something as unlikely as that happened,
then the presumption is that something
is going on with the player.
He is in an altered
state temporarily where
instead of making one in every two baskets
he is now going to make every basket.
And if this is the case, then it is
natural for other players on the team.
To feed him the ball as much as possible,
so
that they can milk his run of
successes while the going is good.
Of course this is compelling.
We all feel instinctively
that this is the case and
we all buy into this
phenomenon of the hot hand.
We've seen this repeatedly,
in basketball and in other sports.
In tennis and baseball, and so on.
But there is another alternative.
And that is a counter-intuitive
suggestion that the string
of successes we're seeing amidst many
trials is not at all unexpected.
That in fact one should expect this.
That this is not unusual.
Of course if this is the case,
then our feeling about the hot
hand is a cognitive illusion.
Which of these two
possibilities is the right one?
And we articulated
a principled statistical test.
William Feller, the probabilist,
has asservated that
even strong faith must be
fortified by a statistical test,
and a test was natural to put
together in that context.
The string of attempts by the player
in question, will see a run
of successes and failures in some order.
And in that mixture somewhere
is a subsequence of five or
more successes in a row.
Superficially, this looks like
the result of tossing a coin repeatedly.
And then our question now becomes is
the particular sequence of attempts
at the basket by the player,
does that look statistically different
from what one would expect if one
had tossed a coin repeatedly?
Now if the profile of the items
in the basket is statistically
similar to that of the tossing of a coin,
then there is
no reason to imagine that the basketball
player's doing anything unusual.
And, this leads to a slogan.
The more likely it is that a success
run of the observed length
occurs somewhere in
a sequence of coin tosses,
the less the credence we place
upon a mysterious hot hand.
After all, if the basketball
player's attempts at the basket
are statically indistinguishable
from tossing a coin repeatedly,
then we really have nothing
more to say on the matter.
It's as if every shot was a one
in two chance and there's nothing
magical which governs one's.
Now when we first postulated this
as a basic principle, we said,
this sounds reasonable, but
technically, it looked confounding.
It looked difficult to analyze.
There were too many pieces moving around,
and it was hard to, to understand how to
begin a logical attempt at the problem.
But we're all grown up now.
We now have a lot of background and
tools at our disposal.
And now we're equipped to come back to
the problem with a principled analysis.
This comes up next.
