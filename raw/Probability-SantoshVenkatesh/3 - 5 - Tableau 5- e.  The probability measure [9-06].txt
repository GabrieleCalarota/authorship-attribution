So without further ado,
what is a probability measure?
The probability measure is a set function.
Now there are two words here,
set and function.
We're all of course, very familiar
with the idea of a function, f of x.
A real value function of a real variable.
Long tradition and
training in the calculus has made us very
comfortable with the idea of functions.
Well the probability
measure is a function but
it is not a common or
garden variety function.
It's a function whose arguments are sets.
This function takes events,
measurable sets and
maps each measurable set or
event to a real number.
The domain of this particular function
is the family of sets of interest to us.
The algebra of sets f.
And each set,
this function P assigns a real value.
All right, this is a little,
oh, troubling.
This is not the usual friendly kind
of function we're familiar with.
But none the less, this kind of
codification of, of extraction,
will as we shall see shortly,
capture the essential idea of chance.
Bear in mind that we want to assign or
ascribe an idea of chance
to events which are sets.
And where then inevitably led to
a process which to sets assigns numbers.
In other words, to a set function.
Well what kinds of properties
should this set function P have?
Well we draw from our experience and
we saw the three fundamental properties.
First, the set function P of A,
in words the probability of the event A,
should represent something like
the frequency that A occurs
in many independent trials
of that experiment.
But frequencies are positive, and
therefore inevitably we will want
all our probabilities to
be strictly non-negative.
This is the fundamental
positivity property.
If you ever encounter, due to a trite
algebraic error, a negative probability.
You pause, step back, and say, well,
this is a nonsense, and go back and
find the error.
The second of the basic axioms,
is that of normalization.
The performance of a Gedanken experiment,
our thought experiment,
always results in an outcome,
in a sample point from the sample space.
And therefore the entire sample
space is a certain event, and
therefore it is natural to ascribe
to it the probability of one.
Now, I should point out
that choosing one for
the normalization is
a matter of convenience.
It is a matter of definition.
This is not something
which is given from a bow.
It is not something which is inevitable.
In fact, in ordinary language,
we use a rather different normalization.
Can you think of what it is?
If you said 100,
of course you're absolutely right.
We talk about the chances of the weather
turning, the chances of rain being 30%.
The chances of a flood being 2%.
The chances of this in
terms of percentages.
Implicit in this, in this kind
of language is that the certain
thing has got 100% chance
the normalization is 100.
But of course while
talking about a subject we
will frequently lapse into colloquial
language and use words like percentages.
But, when we do calculations
we will always revert
to the basic normalization of a unit.
The sample space has got unit probability.
Now these two axioms are natural,
inevitable perhaps.
The third axiom pays for all.
This is a fundamental additivity axiom.
Pause, and write it down.
This is important.
It is hard to over state the importance
of additivity in mathematics.
Additivity is one of the glorious pillars
which supports the entire foundation.
It looks right.
It is a statement of addition and
you'll say, fairly enough,
well, we did addition
in elementary school.
How can this be so complex, so subtle?
But, this has got ramifications
far beyond what it appears.
And we will see this
repeatedly through the course.
This is one of the cornerstone principles,
not only of probability but
of all of mathematics,
the idea of additivity.
How does it manifest itself
in a chance setting?
Well, I should give you a worded notation,
additivity is going to concern
either finite collections or
countably infinite collections.
So when I write a set like A j with
j running over positive integers,
I could mean a finite set.
Or a countably infinite set with j
running over all the natural numbers or
perhaps all the integers.
Now, say that such a collection,
either finite or
countably infinite is pairwise disjoint.
If any two sets of this
collection are disjoint.
Share no elements.
Now if you start with a collection
of pairwise disjoint sets and
you say well let us form a new event by
taking the union of all of these sets.
In other words,
the union is a new event which occurs.
If A1 occurs or A2 occurs or
A3 occurs and so on.
The principle of additivity says
the probability of a union of disjoined
sets is a sum of
the constituent probabilities.
And the notation when I put in a j,
with all the dormant in the subscript,
it means let j run over all
the possibilities in the problem at hand.
So in this case, j is going to run through
a finite number of possibilities or
possibly a countably infinite
number of possibilities.
Imagine an abstract sample space.
Here's a Venn diagram.
Imagine a finite or possibly
a countable infinite number of events,
subsets in the sample space, and
suppose they are mutually exclusive.
No two of them overlap.
You can have a finite number,
let's say two of them, in which case,
we are looking at A 1 and A 2.
And the union of A 1 and
A 2 has got a probability, which is the
sum of the probabilities of A 1 and A 2.
This is what additivity tells us,
the whole is equal to the sum
of the constituent parts.
You can have a finite number,
say n disjoined sets,
the probability of the union is the sum
of those n individual probabilities.
You could have a countably
infinite number of these A J's and
they are all disjoint mutually
exclusive the probability
of a countably infinite union
of these A J's is a series,
a sum of the individual probabilities.
Now, this extension to countable
infinities is, as I said, prudent.
It turns out to be vital.
What it does for us at a high level,
is it allows us to proceed for
finite sums, which are completely
unexceptionable, to series, and
it permits a continuity,
a limiting argument to be made seamlessly.
This is the kind of progression that
one has seen in basic calculus,
when one talks about
series which converge.
It is in that context that these
countable infinities become useful.
