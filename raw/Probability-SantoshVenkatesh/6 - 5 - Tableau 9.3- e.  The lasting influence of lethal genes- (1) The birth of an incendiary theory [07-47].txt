Our next application is drawn
from the sphere of genetics.
I always find, when tackling
a new subject, that the history,
the context is informative,
frequently illuminating.
And if you'll indulge me, I will begin
with a preamble taking you back in time
to the pivotal moment when
the science took off.
This was in the year 1859, and
the book in question, of course,
was Charles Darwin's, The Origin of
Species By Means of Natural Selection.
Now, this was a revolutionary volume,
an incendiary volume, an epochal volume.
To understand why this book
had such a large impact,
was so divisive early on, we need to
understand the context of that time.
Now through recorded history,
our traditions, our religious customs,
had held that events in human
history were shaped cataclysmically,
from the formation of the Earth,
to the origin of species.
That these happened in relatively
short periods of time,
by violent cataclysmic things like floods,
bolts of lightning.
Now, around the early
part of the 19th century,
these questions were drawn into
some doubt among a few thinkers.
And, this was brought to a head
by the publication, in 1830,
of the first volume of three,
of the geologist, Sir Charles Lyell,
a Scottish geologist who published
a book on the principles of geology.
Lyell held that far from
the Earth being created
by cataclysmic events like floods and
so forth, that in fact,
the evidence on the ground suggested that
the formation was much more gradual,
much more by a long period of
accretion of small events.
This is a position we now
call Uniformitarianism.
And Lyell's idea was
that things like erosion,
wind, water, over very long time spans,
ultimately resulted in the massive changes
on the Earth's topography we see today,
the Grand Canyon,
Mount Everest, and so forth.
Now, this was quite contrary to common
understanding, our tradition of formation.
This volume had been extent for
about 20 years when
a young Charles Darwin went out on
a voyage around the world on HMS Beagle,
and the captain of the ship
gave him Lyell's first volume.
To put it mildly, Darwin was enraptured
by the glorious sweep of
the ideas that Lyell laid forth.
There are a couple of iconic images of
Darwin, one taken in 1816, at age seven.
You can see that there's
a budding botanist and naturalist,
all today, and
you see holding a potted plant.
The second image,
perhaps more familiar to students and
readers, is that of a brooding Darwin.
This is about nine years after
the publication of Origin of Species.
You could say the distant look in his
eyes, a measure of sadness, because
the theories he promulgated were highly
controversial, caused no end of dissent.
Perhaps peering past what is
the pervial of mortal man.
Now, what did Darwin postulate?
In a nutshell, Darwin postulated
a uniformitarian theory for
the propagation of species.
And like Lyell,
he suggested a mechanism where species
propagate by passing on
hereditary information from
a parental generation to a filial
generation, and so forth.
That, in so doing,
they compete with other species.
The winners survive, the losers fade out.
Qualities that are found to
be useful are preserved, and
qualities that are found to be detrimental
or are harmful, eventually vanish.
And he postulated all of this
based upon empirical evidence
that he'd gathered on
two long sea voyages.
Now, the ideas immediately had
two strong opposing points.
First, the winning evolution
required a very long time scale, and
this runs promptly against
religious tradition, for instance,
which depending on the part of the world
one is in, postulates that the origins of
the world are from a few thousand years
to maybe tens of thousands of years, and
sometimes a hundred thousand years,
much too little for Darwinian evolution.
The second was that Darwin did
not have a clue as to what this
hereditary mechanism might be,
proposing a theory like this.
In the face of the tradition,
in the face of opposition,
would require great chutzpah,
great cheekiness at minimum,
but Darwin proposed it.
Now, the first of the objections that
the theory required a very long time span,
originally had a setback.
Thermal Dynamic Calculations
by Lord Kelvin,
based on assuming a cooling world,
a cooling Earth,
suggested that the Earth could not
possibly be more than about 100,000 years.
And later revisions to his calculations
led Lord Kelvin to conclude
that perhaps the Earth was not as old
as 50,000 years, much too little for
the kind of timespan that Darwin needed.
This was eventually overturned
at the turn of the century,
by the discovery of radioactive
emission by Rutherford.
A brand new energy source
has now been discovered and
now modern estimates put the age of
the Earth at about 4.5 billion years,
more than ample time for the kind of
evolution that Darwin had in mind.
The second objection that
the mechanism was obscure
needed the advances in looking at
biological objects under a microscope
at very high magnification,
to start understanding the biochemistry of
these objects, require the understanding
of, that we ultimately now call,
a genetic structure for life.
Of course, today,
we understand that genes are the method
by which hereditary characteristics are
passed on from generation to generation.
The entire set of features that
describes a living organism.
For instances, in homosapiens,
the eye color,
the shape of the face, skin color,
the opposing thumb, and
so on and so forth,
are all encoded in the human genome.
So now, let's take a step back and
take a look at this mechanism.
