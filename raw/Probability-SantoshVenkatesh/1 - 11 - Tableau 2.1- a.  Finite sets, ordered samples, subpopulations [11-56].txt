Tableau two, part one.
Elements of counting.
Historically, in the theory of chance,
gambling and
games of chance had a determinant effect,
and in these settings, the primary goal
was to be able to count numerous
alternatives accurately and correctly.
In such settings, elementary combinatorial
arguments become of importance.
Now, this kind of counting,
while important,
it is not central to our purposes, but
we do need the very basic elements.
This is the kind of material
that one should see ordinarily.
Sometime in high school, where one
sees examples of ordered samples, and
in particular, the binomial coefficient.
This material then, constitutes a review
of the very basic elements of counting.
For many listeners, this will be material
that they are very familiar with, and
if this is the case, you should skip ahead
to the summary slide and take a brief note
of the notations and particular
concepts involved before proceeding.
For the others, proceed.
In many settings involving chance,
we start with finite populations.
Let's say, an example,
five letters, a, b, c, d, and e.
Now, in settings like this,
the semantics are rarely of importance.
They add color to the picture sometimes.
They add to the story.
But in terms of evaluations of chance,
they are typically not very relevant.
So instead of all five abstract objects,
we could have, for
instance, 5 different pears.
All five different colors,
or balls, or what have you.
The particulars of the objects
are not relevant for our purposes.
Though, as I did say,
they do add color and
sometimes a, a feeling for the subject.
So let's go back to an abstract
setting where we can look at
the problem as a whole
divorced of its particulars.
So, let's go back to
a collection of five objects.
In this case, let's call them a,
b, c, d and e.
Now, mathematical symbolism is important
here because we want to be able to
accurately describe the objects in the
discussion to each other and to strangers.
So in accordance with this, when you talk
about a population, a collection, a set,
we think of a set of objects,where
the order is not particularly important,
or relevant.
Of course you can imagine laying it out
on a table in some arbitrary order.
But of course it becomes
hard to get a feeling for
the objects under consideration.
And especially when writing it down on
a recent page, we tend to list them, one,
two, three, four, five, a,
b, c, d, e, and some order.
But to reinforce the idea for
us that the order, order is not important,
we introduce some symbolism,
some notation, some terminology.
So, curly parentheses,
curly brackets around
the objects of interest suggest
visually that this is a set.
A set, a collection,
a population where order is not important.
Now once you start the set like this,
a simple experiment would involve
collecting elements from the set.
This is called a sample.
So here for example is an ordered
sample of three elements.
Select a, and then c, and then c again.
For example a bosc pear,
an orange pear, and a yellow pear.
Three different elements.
Now, you notice that in this selection.
I have selected the element c twice,
but the order in fact here,
makes a difference and I make that
explicit by putting the objects under
a different kind of parenthesis,
round brackets.
The round brackets
are a visual indication for
me, that in fact the order
of specification matters.
Now, I have three different possible
orderings of these two objects, a and
c, chosen thrice.
It could be a, c, c,
as in the first line, or c, a, c,
as in the second line, or, c,
c, a, as in the third line.
And a little introspection will
convince you that in fact,
there are no other orderings
of the objects a and c.
Where c is chosen twice,
and a is chosen once.
Now, what if we choose three
objects from this collection, but
with the caveat that an object
can not be repeated?
Now, this is a province of
sampling without replacement.
So here is an example.
Suppose we collect the objects a, c, and d
in the order a first, c next, and then d.
Now, a little thinking will convince you
that there are six possible ways where you
could have selected these three objects,
listed as I have shown you.
Of course, one has to be very careful
in making such an ordering, because you
don't want to miss any orderings, nor
do you want to count an ordering twice.
But in a setting like this,
it's fairly transparent, and
a little, a little taut, will tell
you exactly how many possibilities.
So far so good.
I'll now describe for you how we can
select three objects from a given
set of five objects with replacement and
without replacement.
How about we select three objects and
we do not care about which
order we select them.
In other words, we select a subpopulation
or a subset of the three.
In this case I've given you a subset
of three elements, a, c, and d.
And again notice, visually, I'll put curly
brackets around those three to indicate to
us that these are three elements and their
order of specification does not matter.
I could have said d, c,
a increased in curly brackets or c, a,
d or any other version but as long as
they enclose them in curly brackets,
the order does not matter, it is a set.
To summarize,
sets are enclosed in curly brackets.
Ordered samples with order of
specification matters are enclosed in
round brackets.
If you have an ordered sample,
then the sample may be
with replacement where objects or
elements are allowed to be repeated or
without replacement,
where repetition is forbidden.
Each object can arise at
most once in that sequence.
So they key elements that we've delineated
so far are the ideas of a finite set,
or population and
selection from that set to form samples.
The samples may be ordered.
They may be with replacement or
without replacement.
And if they're unordered,
we call them subsets or sub-populations.
Now that we've understood the three
basic elements of sampling,
we promptly generalize and
think about a setting in abstract.
So here we go.
Suppose now we have a finite set.
This is what we might call
the universal set, colloquially,
we might say it's the population,
from which we are drawing elements.
Now we don't want to a priori,
put a restriction on how many
elements we have in that population.
Certainly not, because we could have five,
we could have ten,
we could have 10 million.
We search around for some way of
describing how many elements we have.
And of course, we resort to algebra, and
we say, we need to give the number of
elements in the population a name,
and what name could we give it?
Inevitably, we call it n.
Why n?
Well, because it is inconceivable
that we call it anything else.
Long tradition and custom, going back
to early school days has conditioned
us to call n an integer number for
some integer variable.
So without further ado, we'll say
the population has got n elements, and
of course now,
because n is not particularly specified,
I'm running out of letters in the alphabet
to describe the members of the population.
So, we'll use subscripts, one, two, three,
four, through n, to describe elements
of this abstract population.
And so, a population of finite
set is a1 through a sub n,
enclosed in curly brackets
to remind ourselves that we
are dealing with a population
where the order does not matter.
Now, it is from such a population that we
are going to be talking about sampling.
And of course, we're going to
be talking about finite samples.
So, let's begin.
If one has a sample, well, how many
members should we have in a sample?
Well, let's say, k.
K, again, is a generic number.
It could be three, five, seven, 11, a
hundred, depending on the problem at hand.
It's algebraic break variable.
Suppose one generates
an ordered sample of size k.
Well, what should the members of
the population be, in this ordered sample?
Well, it could be the third element
followed by the seventh element.
Maybe the third element again.
Maybe the 103rd element,
the 52nd element, and so forth.
That gives you one
particular ordered sample.
To speak about it in abstract,
let us identify the idiocies
of the first element.
Let's go and say we call it j1.
.
The index of the second element,
let's say, is a j2 element.
The index of the third, j3 and so forth.
The index of the last element, jk.
The notation is admittedly getting
a little cumbrous but it is unavoidable.
I'm going to have to have some way of
describing which elements I've picked.
So, let us say the elements of the
abstract sample are aj1, aj2, through ajk.
If the sample is with replacement,
the element of
the original population could be repeated
in the sample at various locations.
If the sampling is without replacement,
then of course,
each element in that sample is unique and
cannot be repeated.
What about if one does
not care about order?
Let's say we are looking at a,
the self same collection of elements,
aj1 to ajk, now without repetition.
And we say, I'm interested in
this ensemble, this collection.
We promptly encase them in curly brackets,
and say, this is a subset or
colloquially, the sub-population
in which we are interested.
So here is the abstract setting.
A finite population of n elements.
A sample of size k.
The sample may be ordered with or without
replacement, in which case we encase it in
curl, in round brackets, or it could
be unordered, where we don't care about
order; it could be a subset, in which case
we enclo, enclose it in curly brackets.
