We have now come to a right understanding
of the idea of independence in
probability.
It is now time to test our understanding
on examples which will stretch
our capabilities a little bit.
So let's begin immediately
with a question of ranking.
So imagine that we have four
protagonists lets call them p, q, r, and
s, think of them as athletes or students,
let's say the athletes want to race.
We are going to rank the athletes, in
order, from the fastest to the slowest or
if you are students from the highest
rank to the lowest rank.
Imagine of course that in this setting,
all possible arrangements of
rankings are equally likely.
What is a natural probability space for
this model?
So let's begin it one step at a time.
We'll naturally want a sample space.
The sample space here is the allocation of
order to the four athletes: p, q, r and s.
In other words we've got
a 4-tuple of individuals and
every possible permutation of this
4-tuple is a valid sample point.
How many possible permutations are there?
Well, there are four factorial per,
permutations, or 24 possible permutations.
Now, for the sample space is all 24
permutations of the letters p, q, r,
and s.
Let's put in place some
events of interest for us.
So, let's start with an event A, which
connotes the possibility that athlete p
ranked ahead of athlete q,
p was ahead of q.
Of course, this is in ordinary language.
But it, it is an event and
therefore it is a subset of
the sample space we have identified.
Which subset is it?
Well, I won't write down all
the possibilities for you but
now it should be easy enough to imagine.
I want to look at all strings of four
letters where p appears before q.
Here's another event, call it B.
That r leads s.
Likewise, all 4-tuples
where r appears before s.
In principle, we could enumerate it.
But it is sufficient now to understand
what the structure of this event is.
The probability measure,
naturally, is combinatorial.
All possibilities are assumed
to be equally likely.
So we are dealing with an atomic measure,
which puts equal mass,
1 over 24 on each atom,
on each permutation.
Let's compute probabilities, 'kay?
Our basic question is,
are A and B independent?
Now, to do this, we have to
understand the probability of A.
We have to understand
the probability of B.
And we have to understand
the probability of A intersection B.
And then we query,
is a rule of products satisfied?
This is the acid test for independence.
Let's go step-by-step.
What can we say about
the probability of A?
Now if p is to be ahead of q,
we can decompose it
in the following ways,
p could be the first.
If that's the case that p will
certainly be ahead of q and
q will have three possibilities.
Or p could be second but in that case for
p to lead q, q must be in one of
the two possibilities following p.
Or p could be the third place and
if that's the case q must be the last
place if she is to follow p.
And therefore there are 3 plus
2 plus 1 possibilities for
putting q to the right of p.
Having put p and
q in place there are two slots left, and
r and
s will have to occupy those two slots.
How can you arrange r and s in there,
well then two factorial are two ways.
And therefore there's a total of 3 plus
2 plus 1, where's a range in p and
q with q following p, two ways of
arranging r and s in any order you like,
and totally, you get 6 times 2, or
12 possibilities for p leading q.
12 outcomes which are favorable for
the event A, that p leads q.
How many possibilities in total?
Well, the total number of outcomes
is 24 of four factorial, and
therefore the probability that p leads q,
the probability of event A is 1 in 2.
Of course, varying a change in names,
an exactly similar calculation holds for
the probability that r leads s,
for the probability the event B.
Therefore both the probabilities of
the events A and B have a chance 1 in 2.
What I can I say about the intersection?
Well, the intersection of A and
B means, p leads q and r leads s.
Well, let's start by putting
q to the right of p.
How many ways are there of doing that?
As we'd notice, 3 plus 2 plus 1 ways.
Now p and
q are allocated with q following p.
There are 2 strokes left.
But if r is to lead s they can pair
now with r taking the leading slot and
s taking the last slot.
Therefore once you place p and
q, r and s are also placed.
And therefore they are 3
plus 2 plus 1 outcomes
favorable to the joint occurrences
of the events A and B.
Again, out of 24 possible outcomes,
and the first chance of
A intersection B is 1 in 4.
Now, to test independence, we find that
1 in 4 is just 1 in 2 times 1 in 2.
And therefore,
the probability of A intersection B
is given by a product of
the probabilities of A and B.
And we conclude by fiat of definition
that the events A and B are independent.
Did that surprise you?
Our introspection looking back at the
problem, perhaps you can convince yourself
of course they're independent because the
placement, the rate of placement of p and
q doesn't depend upon the relative
placement of r and s in terms of
the chances, that seems very reasonable,
very intuitive, and it is correct.
