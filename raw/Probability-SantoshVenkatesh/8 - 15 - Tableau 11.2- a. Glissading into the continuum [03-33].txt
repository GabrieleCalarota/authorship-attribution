Tableau 11.
The fabulous limit laws.
Part two, the law of large
numbers in continuous spaces,
computation Ã  la Monte Carlo.
The law of large numbers,
in the century and
a half that followed its publication,
was extended widely.
At its heart it captures much of
the intuitive content of the theory.
To wit, that relative frequencies capture
the essence of probability in long runs.
To get an understanding of how this
statement can be put in a very
gentle context, I turn to
the setting of continuous variables.
This segment is intended for the student
who wishes to say how a fundamental
theoretical result can be extended widely
and sits at the base of much of the theory
of chance, preparatory, perhaps,
to taking more courses in the subject.
This is, accordingly, a dangerous bend
of lecture, to be sampled as time and
inclination allow at
the student's discretion.
For the student who is in a hurry
to get to the res gestae,
she should skip on promptly to Tableau 11,
Part Three.
For the others, carry on.
Now, to extend the idea of
the law of large numbers,
we shall turn to continuous variables.
And the student who has not already
done so should take this opportunity
to go back and
revisit the dangerous bend tableau 6.2.
With this for preparation,
we shall be equipped to handle a generic
law of large numbers in the continuum.
Now, the algebraic detail is
more pronounced, to be sure, but
if the student keeps her attention
firmly focused on the essence of
the Chebyshev argument that we've
encountered in the case of the binomial,
then she will find that
the argument more or
less goes through seamlessly
without essential change.
But of course,
we're going to need certain analogues of
the key concepts we had seen
in the development earlier.
And accordingly,
we will start with the consideration
of continuous analogues of the idea
of a probabilistic center of mass and
a probabilistic moment of
inertia in the continuum.
The form that Chebyshev's inequality
takes in the continuum, and
of course you will recall that
this captures the likely deviation
of a continuous chance
variable from its expectation.
The idea of independent trials and
independent chance
variables in the continuum.
We recall that independence
is a rule of products.
When we move to the continuum,
then this rule of products is manifested,
but in the context of densities.
And finally,
this subtle principle of additivity,
which is an abiding principle
which forms a skein or
thread which runs right
through the theory.
And we are going to see how additivity
is manifested in the continuum.
We will take these in turn.
