Let me conclude this prelude
with a word on the teaching and
the learning of mathematics.
A serious student of the subject
is not an idle spectator
at a variety show but
learns best by active involvement.
And indeed for
the vast majority of students,
learning mathematics is
a particularly tactile endeavor.
This was codified by the British
mathematician Alan Turing
in a seminal paper that heralded the dawn
of computer science in the year 1936.
Based on his observations
of how we apparently think,
Turing posited a model
of human cogitation and
computation where he
posited that we think and
compute by reading,
pausing, reading again,
pausing, writing, pausing.
Perhaps retracing our steps reading again,
pausing, writing, perhaps erasing,
pausing, reading, and so on.
And so,
to get the most out of these lectures,
a student should have a pencil in hand and
paper to write on.
Equations arise slowly and
languorously on the screen.
Pause the lecture while
you write them down.
Absorb the notation and the logic.
Bear in mind that learning
is not a linear process.
You may find that you have to go back
in your notes to revisit a concept
to figure out,
well what exactly was that again?
Think it through and
when you've understood it,
come back to your current place and
proceed.
A student might recognize the model
of instruction in a classroom.
And, assuredly, in a student's background
she would have had instructors who were
particularly effective at delivering
information which is abstract in nature.
The mathematician Herb Ryser of
the California Institute of Technology was
well aware of these
fundaments in learning.
He had this pretty little trick of writing
beautifully on the blackboard in perfect
silence and waiting for the last pencil
to stop moving before he uttered a word.
His students were vastly appreciative.
So accordingly,
pause the lecture frequently.
Write down the mathematics as it arises.
Feel free to go back to revisit
a concept to further your
understanding of something, an aha
moment as it were, before you proceed.
Our next lectures in this preview will
introduce chance in very simple settings.
And in these very simple settings for
which we have a lot of intuition,
we will discover unexpected and
strange fluctuations,
unexpected phenomena,
things which perturb us.
This doesn't look right.
And in the emergence of such strange
behavior in very simple settings,
the necessity for a theory and
a principled way of thinking about
the subject will become manifest.
