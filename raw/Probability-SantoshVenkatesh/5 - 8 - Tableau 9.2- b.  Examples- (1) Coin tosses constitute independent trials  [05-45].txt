To settle the idea which will immediately
look at some simple examples.
As always, we shall begin with
settings in elementary contexts.
And once we have these firmly under our
belt, we shall quickly abstract and
generalize the principle, before we
look at meaty and real world examples.
So let's start again inevitably
with the toss of a coin.
Consider the following simple experiment
that we've seen oftentimes before.
Imagine that a fair coin
is tossed three times.
To keep matters simple let us write h for
heads, t for tails.
Which immediately begin by writing
down what the sample space of
the experiment is.
And it's clear,
the sample space is a space of triples,
where we specify, for example,
the result of the first toss.
Then the result of the second toss and
finally the result of the third toss.
And we immediately find the finite sample
space of eight elements starting with
the outcome, the sample point of three
heads in a row followed by two heads and
the tail and so forth concluding
with three tails in a row.
Let's write down certain
advance of interest.
So first, let A be the event that
the first toss shows heads.
[SOUND] B, the event that
the second toss shows tails.
[SOUND] And C,
the event tat the coin toss shows head.
Before we move on, we should make sure
we identify the probability measure.
And in this setting,
the coin is fair, the trials
are independent, whatever that means.
But, in our context, we take this to
mean that the probability measure at
hand is combinatorial allocating equal
mass to each of the eight atoms.
In other words,
the atomic probabilities are all 1 in 8.
The simple and elementary question here,
is, are the events A,
B, and C independent?
Naturally enough,
we anticipated they are and
it might be well to pause the lecture for
a moment and
see if you can, in fact,
determine that they are.
Well now that you're back, let's take
a look at what the various events of
interest are, and you'll see them
on the right of your screen.
The event A is a subset of
the sample points and which subset?
Oh, well clearly.
The first element in the triple
has to be heads, and
the remaining two elements
could be anything whatsoever.
And that gives you four possibilities, and
therefore A has got a chance of 4 in 8,
or 1 in 2.
What about B?
The second element in
a triple has to be tails.
And the first and third elements can
be anything, anything whatsoever.
And again, you have four possibilities,
and therefore,
the chances are of B are 4 in 8,
or again, 1 in 2.
And finally,
C is all those triples where the third
element in the triple is a head,
the first two being anything whatsoever.
Four possibilities once more.
4 in 8 gives you a chance of one-half,
say.
What about A intersection B?
This in words, corresponds to the event
that the first toss shows heads and
the second toss shows tails.
This then corresponds to all those
triples where the first element is h,
the next element is t, and
the third element can be either h or t.
And again,
now we have exactly two possibilities.
So the chances of A intersection
B are two, in 8 or 1 in 4.
Likewise, the chances of A intersection C
and B intersection C are again, 1 in 4.
Finally, we'll look at a triple of
intersections, A, with B, with C.
This corresponds to the English statement,
that the first toss shows heads,
the second toss shows tails,
and the third toss shows heads.
There is exactly one triple
with this characteristic.
The triple hth, and
therefore, A intersection B
intersection C is indeed an atom.
A singleton set consisting
of one sample point.
The chances of A intersection B
intersection C then are naturally 1 in 8.
And we immediately observe that
we have a rule of products.
For pairwise intersections, one quarter
is manifestly one-half times one-half,
and therefore, we have a rule of
products for all pairwise intersections.
Likewise, 1 in 8 is one-half times
one-half times one-half, and again,
we have a rule of products manifesting
itself for triple intersections.
All four conditions for
independence are satisfied.
And therefore, we conclude without
further ado that as we anticipated,
the events A, B and
C are indeed independent.
It gives us a warm,
comfortable feeling when
elementary calculations give us results
in accordance with our native intuition.
All this is surely
an encouraging first step.
