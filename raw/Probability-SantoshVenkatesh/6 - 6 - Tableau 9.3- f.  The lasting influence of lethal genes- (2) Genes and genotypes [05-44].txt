Today, we understand that genes are the
carriers of hereditary information.
For our purposes today, we must understand
that the biochemical mechanism,
which replicates and
passes on genes, is not perfect.
Mutations and other changes can creep in.
And so, a gene may ultimately be
expressed in one or more forms.
And these variations on the theme
of the gene are called alleles.
So, for example,
in eye coloring, one has a gene
variation which triggers brown color and
one which triggers the color blue.
Now, in diploid organisms,
and this is what most higher
life forms are, including us,
genes always exist in
pairs called genotypes.
These genotypes exist at particular
loci on a chromosome and
the long string which makes up the genome,
which describes us.
Now, the genotypes, depending upon
whether the gene types are the same or
different, are classified as homozygous,
meaning that the two alleles are the same,
or heterozygous, that is,
the alleles in the pair are different.
This turns out to be critical in
determining characteristics that emerge
and are passed on.
Let us immediately focus on a setting
where a particular gene has two variants,
two alleles.
So let's say we call the alleles cleverly,
uppercase A and lowercase a.
The setting we are going to be
interested in is the one where uppercase
A is the dominant allele.
What it means is the following,
the genotypes that are formed by pairing
up these alleles are three in number,
uppercase A and uppercase A together,
and uppercase A and a lowercase a.
The order does not matter.
Say, could, we could just say,
as well, say lowercase a,
uppercase A is the same thing,
and two lowercase a alleles.
In the case of eye coloring,
the brown gene, upper case A, is dominant.
And what that means is that
an individual with genotype,
with two uppercase As has brown eyes.
It also means that an individual
with a heterozygous genotype,
with an uppercase A and a lowercase a,
also has brown eyes, but
this individual is a carrier.
They contain the blue eye coloring
within their genotype, and
they can pass it on to their progeny.
Individuals with two lowercase a in
their genotype will then have blue eyes.
We will say the blue color is recessive.
Now, this is a pretty harmless variant.
But occasionally,
the recessive gene is not nearly so
harmless and can lead to a fatal disease.
An example is that of sickle cell anemia.
The details are not important
of the biochemistry.
And the picture I've shown you on
the screen is just to illustrate that
we now understand the mechanism by
which a genetic element, a gene,
is modified to create a variant.
In this case, a mutant variant which
leads to a disease, sickle cell anemia.
The second picture on your right,
deals with the disease called Tay-Sachs.
It's a neurodegenerative disease, and
its change occurs in a particular location
of the chromosome, at chromosome 15.
And again,
the details are not important for
our purposes, no less because the details
of the biochemistry are now hitting
about my limits of my
knowledge of the subject.
But, before we go on,
it'll be good to see how such
mutations lead to microscopic
changes which affect the individual.
On your left, you'll see
a visualization of sickle cell anemia,
which is a blood cell disease.
Normal red blood cells are disk shaped.
They're like, look like donuts.
They are the carriers of oxygen.
They tumble freely through your blood
vessels, because they are shaped like
this, they go tock, tock, tock,
tock, tock, rattle right through.
But the mutant variation,
which leads to sickle cell anemia,
leaves you blood cells which
look like sickles, or crescents.
The difficulty here is two-fold.
One, the absorption area available
to a cell which is in the form of
a sickle is much less, and therefore,
its oxygen carrying capacity
is significantly decreased.
And further, these crescents
can hook up to cause chains.
And these chains can cause clots,
with possibly fatal
consequences to the organism.
On your right,
you'll see the consequences, or
visualization of Tay-Sachs disease,
is the degenerative neural disease which
causes a degeneration of neural tissue and
ultimately, a breakdown of the organism.
So this is the setting
that we have in mind.
A gene, which appears,
let's say, in two variants,
two alleles, one of which is dominant,
we'll call that Cap A, uppercase A,
one of which is recessive and
lethal, lowercase a.
Our interest is in how such genes evolve
and propagate through the generations.
