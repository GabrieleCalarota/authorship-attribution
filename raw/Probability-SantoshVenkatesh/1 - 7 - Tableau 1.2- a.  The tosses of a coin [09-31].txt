Tableau one.
Prelude to a theory of chance.
Part two, the amazing aspects of
fluctuations and the hot hand phenomenon.
In tableau one part one we looked
at evidence of chance around us.
Chance is ubiquitous.
And naturally, we have a strong and
intuitive feel for it.
But in the midst of
the familiar lurks strangeness.
And as part of the introductory lectures,
I want to conclude by showing
you unexpected deals, unexpected
ripples in the fabric of chance.
In experiments with which
we are quite familiar.
So to begin,
what is the simplest experiment
one can think of involving chance?
Unquestionably, the toss of a coin.
[SOUND] So, let's consider
the repeated tosses of a coin.
And of course, this gives us a template
for what we view as a random sequence.
Now, we are at the start
of a semester of study.
And perhaps a little
tedium could be forgiven.
So, I'm going to ask you to do
two exercises at the cost of
a modicum of tedium.
Naturally enough, I hope that you'll be
willing to indulge me, because there is,
of course, a method in the madness.
So to begin,
our simplest understanding of what
constitutes a random sequence assuredly
comes from the repeated toss of a coin.
Do the following, take a coin,
toss it repeatedly 50 times and
write down the sequence of successes and
failures, heads and
tails that you observe.
To keep life simple for yourself,
write 1 for the head and 0 for the tail.
And so what you will write is
a long string of 50 1s and 0s.
Do this now.
Pause the lecture and when you've
completed writing your sequence, restart.
Oh good, you're back.
Now, here is the second part
of what I'd like you to do.
As your exemplar of a random sequence,
write down
the first 50 ones and
zeroes that comes into your head.
Don't overthink it, just write down what
comes naturally to you as an example
of a random sequence, something like
11001110000110101 and so forth.
just a string of ones and
zeros randomly generated from you.
Pause the lecture while you do this and
restart when you're ready to continue.
Good.
Now we have two sequences.
Examine them.
Do they look similar?
Do they share characteristics?
Or do they look rather different
microscopically from each other?
Pause again, and take a look at them.
See if you can discern any patterns or
lack there of in your sequences.
And restart the lecture when
you're ready yet again.
So, now you're back.
Here is an example of sequences that
I generated in accordance
with the rules I gave you.
Here are two sequences labeled star and
double star.
I generated one of them by
tossing this coin 100 times.
And I generated the other
by just writing down a random jumble of
ones and zeros that came into my head.
Can you tell which was which?
Now, these sequences are similar to
the sequences you've written down.
One of them generated by a toss of a coin.
One of them generated from my mind.
Are they different?
Do they share similar features.
Now assuredly, both of them are
purportedly representing random sequences.
The exemplar of a random sequence is
the one generated by the toss of a coin.
Is the one generated artificially
similar in characteristic?
Which is which?
Can I discern one from the other?
Well naturally, if a sequence is random,
we feel instinctively that
maybe one should check to see that
the successes and failures are in balance.
Are the ones and zeros in balance?
Now, if you look at
the sequence labeled star,
you'll find that there are 49 ones and
51 zeroes.
The sequence labeled double star, on
the other hand, has 46 ones and 54 zeroes.
The ones and zeroes, heads and
tails, look like they're in balance.
It doesn't look like there's
very much to on that score.
Now, in a situation like this
it is always profitable to
see if one can draw a picture.
So, here is a graphical view
of these two sequences.
What I've done is plotted the sequences
as if they were drawn temporally.
From left to right in time.
So, one for anywhere you see a one and it
drops to a zero whenever you see a zero.
And you observe, in both sequences,
a rather random jagged movement
between ones and zeros.
Very good.
Now, looking at the figure
does anything stand out?
Now, when you look at these two figures,
you might say, well,
the graph of the sequence
labeled star is jagged, but
it appears to have rather large mesas and
valleys, peaks and dips.
Now, to focus on them, here are three,
a mesa and two valleys,
which seem to be quite large.
The sequence labeled double star,
on the other hand,
is jagging back and forth fairly
unpredictably, like the first sequence.
But doesn't seem to have a large mesa or
a large valley anywhere.
If we hone in on these mesas and valleys,
you find that in the sequence label star
you have at one place in the sequence,
seven contiguous ones.
Seven heads.
And in two other places with sequence,
a sequence of five consecutive tails.
And a sequence of six consecutive tails.
The sequence labeled double star, on the
other hand, has no contiguous sequence of
successes and failures, heads and
tails, of length more than four.
Hm, I wonder if the evidence for
the sequence labeled star is
looking just a little suspicious.
Do we anticipate that in
a string of coin tosses,
that we'll get repeated
self same outcomes?
Consider for example,
seven tosses of this coin.
What are the chances of obtaining
seven heads in a row, in seven tosses?
Now, if one tosses this coin seven times,
each toss has got two possibilities,
a head or a tail.
And so the sequence of seven tosses has
got 2 times 2 times 2, 7 times in all or
2 to the power 7 or
128 possible different
sequences of heads and tails.
Of those 128 distinct possible
sequences of heads and tails,
the sequence with all heads is
precisely one of them and so the odds,
in a very natural sense, of observing 7
heads in 7 tosses of a coin is 1 in 128.
Less than 1%, or more precisely,
no more than 8 chances in 1,000.
This looks distinctly suspicious, so
should we anticipate that in a random
sequence of 100 1s and 0s,
that somewhere there's a sequence of 7 1s?
Or five zeros.
Or six zeros in a row.
This is looking distinctly suspicious.
To proceed further,
perhaps then we should look at
patterns where there are successive
runs of successes and failures.
We turn to this next.
