Thus far,
we have seen various examples of sets.
Collections, which arise in
various kinds of applications.
It will be useful to have in
mind a generic abstract set,
on which we are going to
be pending our analysis.
And so let's begin by thinking about
some abstraction for all of this.
At the back of our minds,
in what our application is at hand,
we'll be dealing with some set of
possibilities, a universal set.
In the theory of chance, we will
frequently call this the sample space.
We are imagining that
we're actually sampling,
picking out elements from this collection,
from this basket of possibilities.
In the theory of probability, the standard
representation for a universal set,
the sample space,
is the upper case Greek letter omega.
And we will from now on
represent an abstract setting,
a universal set, by upper case omega.
What about the elements of the set?
Well, the elements of
the set are denoted then,
naturally enough, by lower case omega.
And we will say that these
are the elements of the universal set
of a sample points of the set.
In specific settings, we will dispense
with this abstract notation, and
use notation that tradition
compels us to use.
So for example, if you're dealing
with natural numbers or the integers.
They'll use blackboard bold Z, and
you'll represent typical integers
by letters like n, or
occasionally i, j, k, l, or m.
If you're dealing with a real line,
we'll use blackboard bold R,
instead of capital omega.
And represent generic members by x,
y, z, occasionally u or v or s or t.
And if we're dealing with functions,
say continuous functions,
we'll represent them by script c.
And of course, a generic function is
represented by f, occasionally g or h or
something else.
We will not be hidebound and
insist on staying with notation,
which is traditional,
if circumstances tell us it'll be
better to use some other description.
But of course,
you understand these are natural,
normative descriptions of
these kinds of objects.
Now, it'll be convenient to have
a short mathematical notation to
say this is an element of the set.
Right, so let's say we're dealing with
a universal set, an abstract set,
uppercase omega.
We will indicate membership of
uppercase omega by saying an element,
little omega,
is an element of uppercase omega and
we have a short mathematical notation,
meaning all of that.
And we will consistently
use this standard notation.
So here is one abstract setting,
at one end of the spectrum,
a, an abstract universal set,
upper case omega.
On the other end of the spectrum,
we have the trivial set,
a set with nothing in it.
I wonder, why would we bother with
something which has nothing it?
Well, it's because,
as a preview, we are going to be
able to to algebra on these objects.
The kind of arithmetic in algebra
that you are very familiar
with from elementary school and
middle school.
And of course, when you do arithmetic or
algebra, we have an idea of a zero.
The empty set and
here is the standard notation for
it, a circle with a cross line through it.
This represents, in a fundamental sense,
a zero in the idea of an algebra offset.
For us, the empty set is an,
a set which has no elements in it.
Okay, so thus far,
we have now built up some language,
some way of describing
collections of abstract objects.
Where do we go from here?
The next setting is to consider
subcollections of these objects.
So bear in mind that at
the back of the experiment,
there is always a universal
set of possibilities, omega.
And we are going to be dealing
with elements from omega.
Now, a subcollection of
these elements from omega,
is called naturally a subset.
And the mathematical notation,
compactly on the right of the screen,
tells you how we can
describe these subsets.
So that notation says,
A is a subcollection, it is a sub-set of
this bigger set, omega,
in this case the universal set.
Now, obstruction is all well and good,
but we respond well to visual stimuli and
some visual representations,
sometimes, are very useful for
seeing the relationships between
various abstract objects.
In the setting of sets, these visual
representations are called Venn diagrams.
And, I've given you here on the screen,
a representation of a subset
of a universal set.
I've represented the universal
set by a rectangle, that's omega.
You should think of your, the elements of
omega as points in that set somewhere.
And a subset shown naturally as
a blob inside this collection.
It connotes a subcollection
of the elements of omega.
You should bear in mind that this is
purely for visual representation.
There is no intent to convey
any kind of geometry.
An area doesn't mean anything here this
is purely a representation on paper
of an abstract object.
And sometimes, these representations
give us some kind of cue as to how
things interact with each other.
Well, this is all very abstract.
So, some concrete examples might
allow us to settle these concepts.
Well, what are the simplest
examples of subsets?
Well, the simplest examples are,
well, A could be omega itself.
Omega itself is a subcollection of itself.
In other words, if your subcollection
contains all the elements of the original
set, it is the original set, and
here's a trite and simple subset.
At the other end of the spectrum,
if your set A has got no elements in it,
in other words, it is the empty set.
That is also patently a subcollection,
a subset of the whole.
Of course, these are trite and obvious.
Let's stitch together some more
interesting examples to settle
the concepts.
So let's begin with the setting where,
let's say we throw a die.
We then define pips by numbers,
one pip through six pips,
with the numbers 1 through 6.
This is the dictionary of translation
that we agree on ahead of time.
The set at hand, the universal set,
is then the collection of numbers from
1 through 6 in any order you like.
Suppose I'm interested in
a throw which exceeds four.
This describes a subcollection,
a subset, and
we identify it as the elements five and
six together.
And so now we have a subset
A consisting of elements five and
six which is a subset of the set of
possibilities the numbers 1 through 6.
Let's pick a,
an example from the second example
I've shown you on sets, from graphs.
Imagine a graph on a certain
number of vertices, say n.
The family of all such graphs is
potentially a large family, if n is large.
For example,
you could imagine a setting where we're
looking at flights between cities.
Cities representing vertices in a graph.
Edges between cities showing that there
are direct flights between cities.
And now we can understand,
well here's a setting for transportation.
This gives us a family, a set,
a universal set, the set of graphs.
Those graphs, which, for example,
let's say have two edges,
represent a sub collection
a sub set of graphs on these.
Still another example and now let's
go on into the domain of numbers.
The collections of prime numbers
have drawn interest since antiquity.
And in the modern day, are vitally
important in electronic commerce,
through providing security
through cryptography.
Prime numbers are at the heart of
cryptographic protection schemes.
The collection of prime numbers,
the numbers two, three, five,
seven, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on.
You could knew there were an infinity
of prime numbers, okay, and
you might have seen a proof of
this in an elementary class.
But the collection of prime numbers
clearly is a subcollection of
the collection of integers.
The prime numbers
are a subset of the integers.
If we move on to the real number line,
we can think of other rich connections,
subcollections of the whole.
For example, fractions, in other words,
rational numbers denoted
by blackboard bold Q,
is a subset of the real line.
All right, so we now have an understanding
of what subsets might mean and
we think of Venn diagrams as ways of
representing, visually, relationships.
