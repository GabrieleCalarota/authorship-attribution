Let's move onto another setting,
just to settle the concepts.
Again, a setting which is very familiar.
Let's look at the setting of dice.
Okay.
Here's an example constructed by
the Soviet,
Russian mathematician S N Bernstein.
Imagine that a die is thrown twice.
Of course,
we imagine that it is a fair die.
That it's got six faces.
The faces are numbered one through six.
We immediately then identify
the sample space by
identifying a system of ordered pairs,
j and k, let us say.
Where j represents the face shown
by the first throw of the die,
k the face shown by
the second throw of the die.
Of course, j and k are integer
values running between one and six.
And therefore, there are 26
possibilities for these pairs.
The sample space has got 36 atoms.
Let's look at it, some events that we
can construct from this experiment.
So, let A be the event that
the first throw shows an odd number.
Other words, the first throw shows one,
three, or five.
Let B be the event that the second
throw shows an even number.
In other words, the second throw
shows a face two, four, or six.
Now let's put together
a composite event and say.
What C shows is the event describing
the attribute that the sum of the face
values in the two throws is an odd number.
Remember face values will add
up to values between 2 and 12.
So the sum of the face values being
odd will correspond to all pairs,
for which the sum is 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11.
Well we have three events yeah.
But before we proceed let's
identify the probability measure.
And naturally enough the die is fair,
the repeated throws are independent
whatever that means.
And what in our context will identify this
is to say that you have 36
atoms in this experiment.
It is going to be a combinatorial setting.
Where every atom is equally likely.
And therefore,
all atomic probabilities are 1 in 36.
And again, the question.
Are these events A, B and C independent?
Pause the lecture and
run a rule through the definition
to see whether you can check on
whether this in fact is valid.
All right now let's come back and
identify all the events of
interest in this problem.
So, let's start with the event A.
The first face is odd.
That means we are looking at
all the ordered pairs, j and
k, where j is an odd number.
In other words j is one, three or five.
What about k?
Well, k could be anything whatsoever.
In other words, we're looking at ordered
pairs of the following characteristic.
(1,1), (1, 2), (1, 3) and
so on through (1, 6).
(3, 1), (3, 2) and so on through (3, 6).
And finally, (5, 1), (5,
2) and so on through (5, 6).
Okay, what is the probability of this?
Well, since the first element
can be specified in three ways.
The second element is unfettered,
can be specified in six ways.
There are 3 times 6, or
18 ways of specifying such ordered pairs.
18 out of 36 gives you a chance of 1 in 2.
It's very comforting, because of course,
we understand that the events that
the first phase shows odd by symmetry.
Should have the same chance as the event
that the first phase shows even.
But of course it is comforting to have
the formal calculation verified as
a intuitive correct answer.
Let's quickly run through B.
The event of B is, describes a setting
where the second throw shows an even face.
Which means you're looking
all ordered pairs.
Remember events are subsets
of the sample space.
The sample space here is a space of pairs.
Which ordered pairs take the box for B.
Well, you look at all other pairs j and
k where k is an even number,
two, four, or six.
And of course, j could be anything
whatsoever, one through six.
Again, the chance of this.
There are six possibilities for
the first element, three for the second.
Therefore there are 6 times 3 over 18
possibilities in favor of the event B
out of 36 possibilities.
And therefore again,
B naturally and inevitably has
got a probability of one and two.
What about C?
A little more complex, but
we can break this down.
Remember a game C represents the event
that the sum of face values is odd.
Our first rule of business is to identify
those pairs which trigger this event.
Remember game C has to be subset of pairs.
Which pairs?
Well, if a sum of two integers is odd,
that must necessarily
mean that one of the integers is even,
and the other is odd.
But this can happen in two ways,
j could be even, and
k, odd or, j could be odd, and k, even.
What are the chances of this happening?
Well, j odd.
Well there are three ways of j being odd,
one, three, or five.
K even.
Well there are three ways of k being even,
two, four, or six.
And therefore, there are 3 times 3, or
9 ways, for j being odd and k being even.
And, by the same kind of argument,
there are exactly 3 times 3 ways, or
9 ways, of j being even, and k, odd.
Altogether, you have 9 plus 9 or
18 outcomes favorable to
the event C out of 36.
And again,
C has got a probability, 1 and 2.
A little introspection should tell
us this is also to be expected.
Again, there is full
symmetry in this game.
And therefore, about half the time
we should get an odd sum and
about half the time we
should get an even sum.
And the calculations support this.
Let us know consider the intersections
of pairs of these events.
What does it mean to say A intersection B?
This means that the first
face shows an odd number.
And on the second throw
the face shows an even number.
In other words, we are looking at
ordered pairs j and k where j is odd.
There are three possibilities.
K is even.
There are three possibilities.
Therefore there are 3 times 3 or
9 possibilities out of 36.
And therefore,
the chance of A intersection B is 1 in 4.
But a very similar argument works for
A to section C and B to section C.
Let's take a look A intersection C for
our difference.
A represents the event that
the first phase is odd.
C represents the event that
the sum of the face values is odd.
But if the first face is odd, j is odd.
And the sum of j and k is odd,
that forces k to be even.
And therefore, A intersection C
is precisely that collection
of ordered pairs j and k.
Where j is an odd number, one, three or
five and k is an even number,
two, four or six.
And again, there are 3 times 3 or
9 possibilities out of 36.
It's again, 1 in 4.
And B intersection C, likewise.
Is again ordered pairs j and k,
where j is odd and k is even.
In other words, A intersection B,
A intersection C and
B intersection C are all
exactly the same event.
The English description on the left gives
you different flavors of this event.
But they all describe
exactly the same object.
And therefore, it is not at all surprising
that all these objects have the same
probability, 1 in 4.
What about A intersection
B intersection C?
Hm.
The first phase is odd.
The next throw shows an even phase,
and the sum is odd.
But, if the first phase is odd,
and the second phase is even,
the sum is forced to be odd.
This is another way of saying
that the event A intersection B
is contained in or
implies the occurrence of the event C.
And therefore,
A intersection B intersected C
is just A to section B itself.
Which means that A intersection
B intersection C.
Cases of all pairs where j is odd and
k is even, and
there are exactly nine such pairs.
Which gives you a chance of one in four.
Okay, let's pause now and
see how we're doing with our
rule of products one and four.
And surely one-half times one-half.
And therefore for
all pairs, A and B, A and
C, B and
C a rule of products is manifested.
But for
a triple one-quarter is manifestly not
one-half times one-half times one-half.
And therefore,
the rule of products is violated when
you have the three intersections.
What we have discovered is A,
B and C are pairwise independent,
but they are not independent jointly.
When we say independence when there
are many events floating around,
we'll always mean jointly and
we'll drop the descriptor.
Okay.
So, the moral of the story is
that independence is a rule of
four properties when you're talking
about independence of three events.
Examples have led us to conclude that
independence certainly implies
pairwise independence.
If all four rules are satisfied, then
manifestly the first three are satisfied.
So when you have joint independence,
pairwise independence is implied.
But just having the first three
of those properties satisfied
does not imply that all
four are satisfied.
Pairwise independence does not
imply independence in general.
And indeed, these four relations
that describe independence for
three events at a time are inseparable.
In a sense,
that no three of them imply a fourth.
I will let you explore examples along
these lines in your problems for solution.
