To summarize the key ideas,
probability measure is positive,
is normalized, is additive.
And in the context of discrete spaces,
everything simplifies.
So to summarize what you have learned,
indiscrete settings.
To begin, atoms, singleton events,
events consisting of single sample points,
carry mass in discrete spaces.
These atomic probabilities,
let us say that we had to define
a particular outcome, omega k.
The atom consisting of omega k is
allocated a probability that
we call lowercase p of k.
As k varies, as we run through
all possible sample points,
we determine a function of the integers.
This function is called a mass function or
a distribution.
And, it'll suffice for us to check
to see that the mass function is a,
positive, and b, properly normalised.
These are the sanity checks
we'll always run through.
Once we have this under our belt, then,
we put together event probabilities.
We construct a probability measure,
a set function on
events by simply appealing
to the additivity axiom.
Any event, let's say an event
consisting of the k1th outcome,
k2th outcome, and so forth.
Has probability allocated to it
obtained by summing the atomic
probabilities corresponding to k1,
k2, k3, and so forth.
Additivity rides to the rescue.
Additivity now gives us a trite
computation of probability measure.
Occasionally, depending on
the particular functional form for
the mass function,
it turns out we have nice and
elegant analytical expressions for
such probabilities.
At other times we have
to be satisfied with
numerical evaluations
of these probabilities.
But in all cases, we now have a complete
and satisfactory construction.
Which gives us probability
measures in discreet spaces.
Now for the first half of this class,
an understanding of probability measures
and discreet spaces will suffice.
We can build a very rich and vibrant
theory already with this understanding.
But of course, eventually we would want
to move on to even more complex settings.
Part 2 of this top low shows how
one could move from the discreet
settings to non-discreet
settings to continue settings.
