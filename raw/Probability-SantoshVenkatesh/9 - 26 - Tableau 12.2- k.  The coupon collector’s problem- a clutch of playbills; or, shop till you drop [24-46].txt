I must confess to a certain
amount of whimsy and
indiscipline when I was creating
this portion of the lecture.
The images you see on screen
are playbills for the 14 Gilbert and
Sullivan comic operas that were produced
between the years 1875 and 1896.
These were written by
the great comic librettist
William Frank Gilbert and the musical's
calls are arranged by Arthur Sullivan.
And of course you know now that
Gilbert and Sullivan operate as.
I must confess that I actually had a more
portentous example in mind to create for
you today.
But one of my daughters called me out
when I was preparing the lecture and
said oh,
you're not really preparing a lecture.
You're actually playing and looking at
this Gilbert and Sullivan playbills.
This is true I,
this was indiscipline on my part.
I played hooky and
I started looking at these
playbill's from over the internet.
I happen to be a huge Gilbert and Sullivan
fan and so yes, I was being indisciplined.
But having done this, I've got these
playbill's up on my computer screen,
I said well I've got to justify
the investment in time.
So I changed my mind and
I decided to create an application
where Casey's playbills come into play
in the context of this Poisson sieve
that we've been talking about.
So if you'll indulge me,
there's a little bit of a muser here,.
This is going to be related to a another
classical and beautiful problem
which has a cause in subtle
modern applications.
So let me give you a clean
version of the problem.
This is called the coupon
collector's problem.
And let me put this in
the context of the Gilbert and
Sullivan playbills in the following light.
Let us say that,
a novelty manufacturer perhaps in London,
faced with falling sales
of his novelty items.
The sites are trying to capitalize on
a feeling of nostalgia current
in the population at this time.
And to incite people to buy his novelty
goods, he insets with each good,
a coupon, a playbill of an original
Gilbert and Sullivan opera.
These playbills are chosen at random and
inserted into these pieces of
merchandise that he purchased.
Of course, an emotional public
flocks to this manufacturer and
starts buying these novelty
gadgets in large numbers
hoping to collect all the original
Gilbert and Sullivan playbills.
Of course, we want to properly abstract
away the, the trappings of this problem.
Imagine that and so these playbills
we have n coupons in collectibles.
Of course, these could be the Gilbert and
Sullivan playbills but,
you know I could replace them by
anything else that strikes your fancy.
GI Joe figurines,
baseball cards, cricket cards,
images of soccer players,
football players, what have you.
You have n coupons and
coupons are selected
randomly and inserted into merchandise.
When you purchase a piece of
merchandise you hurriedly open it and
see what coupon is inside it.
Now, what is your objective?
Of course,
you'd like to get all the coupons,
you'd like to get all the playbills,
all the figurines, all the baseball cards.
Now, let us say that in your first flash
of enthusiasm you go and buy not just
one or two or three pieces of merchandise,
you buy let's say t units of merchandise.
And now our questions
are going to be related to
if you buy t pieces of merchandise.
How many distinct playbills, coupons,
figurines, did he manage
to collect in that time?
Of course,
the luck of the game would mean that,
that you pick up some particular coupon.
And then in several other purchases,
you happen to get the same coupon.
Bad luck but if you purchase
enough pieces of merchandise
then with luck you will eventually
get all the coupons on most of them.
So, how many distinct coupons
do we get after t purchases?
Of course,
we discount multiples of the coupons.
We want distinct individual coupons,
how many?
Oh, here's another question,
if you really are insistent upon
collecting all the n coupons.
How many purchases do you need
to make before you can do this?
Of course, this looks like an amusing
little problem of no great moment.
But nonetheless,
it gives us a beautiful vehicle for
investigating what are sub-strata
our theory leads us towards?
Of course, it's a chance game
we've simplified the problem.
We assume that all the coupons are equally
likely and each of them is equally likely
of distribution into any given
particular piece of merchandise.
That the manufacturer has got an infinite
supply of these coupons available,
so he can keep putting coupons
in without denuding his supply.
And what of the chance experiment here?
Well, naturally enough our very first
question is going to be inevitably,
what is the sample space for the problem?
And the moment you do this you realize.
Well, what have I done?
I've purchased t pieces of merchandise
with each piece of merchandise I
picked up a coupon, a playbill.
The entire chance experiment is completely
specified as far as our interests
are concerned in the particular coupons
that you picked up in your t purchases.
In other words, the sample points
are going to be adequately
described by a t tuple of integers.
Label the coupons 1 to n and specify a
team tuple where each of the elements k1,
k2, k3 through k17 represent
numbers from 1 through n.
They represent which coupons
you got on which purchases.
And this ensemble of purchase tell you
all the coupons you've
acquired over t purchases.
Of course, there could be duplications
of coupons in these purchases.
So, sampling is implicitly here with
replacement from an underlying population,
things can be repeated.
All right, now we've got a t tuple of
coupons sampling with replacement.
What are the underlying
probability measure?
Actually, inevitably it's
going to be combinatorial.
Every t tuple has the same
chance as every other t tuple.
But look at our gain,
what are we doing here?
We're selecting a coupon at random for
the first purchase, that's what we get.
We're selecting a coupon independently
at random for the second purchase,
independently at random for
the third purchase, for the th purchase.
We've got a setting of
repeated independent trials.
Of course,
this is going to make it very easy.
The combinatorial measure is going to
place equal mass on these objects.
Each of the coupons has got a chance 1
in n of being selected on each trial.
Therefore, a given selection of
coupons has got probability.
All right, independence we have a product
measure 1 over n to the power t or
simply the reciprocal of n to the power t.
Excellent, what now are the evens at hand?
Let's take a good look at this.
Naturally, the events of interest
are whether I acquire the first coupon, or
the second coupon, or the third coupon,
and so forth, over t purchases.
What is the bad event?
That I don't acquire a particular
coupon after those t purchases.
So let's promptly give it a name.
Let A1 be the sad, unfortunate event that
after t purchases expended,
I have not acquired the first coupon.
Let A2 be the event that after t purchases
I have not acquired the second coupon.
Generically, Aj the event
that after t purchases
I have not acquired the jth coupon.
Now, we could write down a subset of
a sample space, corresponding to this,
but I am not going to do this because
now it's clear what we're going to need.
A sub j is the event,
comprised of all of those t tuples,
of integers from 1 through n
where none of the elements
in the t tuple is j, because if you did,
then you'd have acquired the jth coupon.
So you're looking at all t
tuples where you avoid j.
Let's promptly put in place an indicator
for this unfortunate, sorry event.
Let X sub j be the indicator for
the event Aj.
X sub j is 1 means that in t purchases
you have not acquired coupon j.
Now, with these basic events, what
are the general events of interest to us?
Well, the first event is
that in t purchases I am
lucky enough to get every
one of the coupons,
the playbills, that I'm hoping to collect.
The event that I get
coupon 1 is A1 complement.
The event that I acquire coupon 2 in t
purchases is A2 complement, and so on.
And therefore, the event of interest is
the intersection of these complements.
This is a good event.
The events A1 A2 are the bad events.
The complements are the good events.
And I'd love dearly to figure out,
what are the chance of the good event
occurring, that I get all the coupons?
In terms of the indicators,
this is the equivalent to the event
that the sum of indicators is 0.
If the sum of the indicators is 0,
that means that none of the bad events
happened, which means I've managed
to acquire all the coupons.
And more generally of course,
we'd like to know
the chances of not acquiring say,
k coupons, out of the n.
And this is then the event at hand, where
the sum of the indicators is exactly k.
Before we launch into the analysis,
it's not going to be hard, okay.
But it's going to require
setting it up carefully.
Let's take stock of these events,
all right?
Individually, the events seem to
be fairly easy to characterize.
The difficulty, of course,
is that these events are not independent.
If you've acquired the first coupon,
then you
know that at least one of the purchases
cannot be allocated to the second coupon.
And perhaps more if the first
coupon were duplicated or
triplicated, which means that we have
fewer chances to get the next coupon.
And each new coupon you acquire
reduces the chance of acquiring
the remaining coupons.
Events are sadly dependent.
But we also anticipate that the level
of dependence is not significant.
And this as we shall see,
will indeed be the case.
Things are all set up for
an inclusion-exclusion argument.
So let's promptly set this thing up.
We want to figure out the
inclusion-exclusion sums, S1, S2, S3, S4.
And let's start with the simplest case
again to settle intuition the very
first term.
What does this involve?
This involves figuring out the probability
that a particular coupon is not acquired.
Let's pick the first coupon.
What is the chance that in t purchases,
we do not acquire the first coupon?
Well, the very first Gilbert and
Sullivan opera was Thespis.
What is the chance we don't
get the playbill for Thespis?
Well, this is easy enough to figure out.
This means that we're looking
at t tuples of purchases
where none of the elements
in the t tuple is 1.
The probability that a particular purchase
lands the first element is 1 in n.
The probability that a particular
purchase does not land the first coupon
is 1 minus 1 in n,
an elementary use of additivity.
By independent trials,
the probability that in t independent
trials we do not acquire the first coupon
is 1 minus 1 over n to the power t.
Of course this argument is impeccable for
any of the coupons by the symmetry
inherent in the problem.
And therefore,
the first inclusion-exclusion sum, S1,
is simply n times 1 minus
the reciprocal of n to the power t.
We're not going to try to
simplify it at this point.
Let's build more ammunition
before you come back and
say well what is this
strange thing behaving like?
What can we say about the second term?
Well pick two generic coupons,
let's say one and two.
What are the chances that we
are unlucky enough to not
acquire either one or two in t trials?
That is the probably
of A1 intersection A2.
Well, that means the chance of
acquiring on a given purchase one or
the other of these two coupons is 2 in n.
The chance of not acquiring
either of them is 1 minus 2 in n.
And the chance of not
acquiring other of them over t
independent trials is 1 minus
2 over n to the power t.
Again, the calculations are impeccable for
any pair of coupons.
And therefore,
the second inclusion-exclusion sum, S2,
is given simply by n choose 2 times
1 minus 2 over n to the power of t.
Or in terms of the following
factorial notation,
n to the 2 falling over 2 factorial
times 1 minus 2 over n to the power t.
And now we're all set.
What are the jth term?
Pick any j coupons, so for
definiteness, the first j coupons.
What is the chance that in t purchases
none of first j coupons are acquired.
And now we know exactly
how this is going to go.
The chance that on a given trial,
none of those first j coupons
is acquired is 1 minus j over n.
The chance that this unhappy
event happens in t independent
purchases in a row is 1 minus
j over n to the power t.
And therefore,
the corresponding inclusion-exclusion sum,
S sub j is simply n choose
j times this quantity.
And we'll simply write it out in falling
factory notation as n to the j falling
over j factorial times 1 minus
j over n to the power t.
Now, we understand the generic term.
It's a little more complex than what we
saw for the [FOREIGN], but no matter.
It's still an elementary functional form.
And with luck, if we are good and
say our prayers at night,
this might fall into our laps
in some nice and compact way.
Let's take a look.
So we want to look at
the inclusion-exclusion sums, and
we've got an explicit formula for it.
Admittedly, its looking more
cumbrous than we would like but
let's take a look at the power.
T is some fixed number,
I'm going to hold that for the time being.
N, I'm going to think of as a large
number, a large number of coupons.
So, what I've got is,
1 minus some constant j over
a large quantity to a given power.
Have I seen anything like this before?
Maybe in an elementary calculus class.
Have you scratch about
in your memory bags?
You might actually stumble upon
the following observation.
This actually looks like an exponential.
Remember, that if you look at 1 minus x
over n, the whole thing to the power n.
Think of x as something fixed and
n as large, and the limit as n goes
to infinity, that quantity goes
to e to the power minus x.
In fact, one could use this as
a definition of exponential function
as one of the alternate
ways of defining it.
Okay, so here's a fact from calculus.
Now, I've got something which
is reminiscent of this,
except I don't seem to have
a power n in the power.
Let's simply add it in there by
multiplying and dividing by n.
Now what do we have?
Well, we have the binomial
coefficient in front
1 minus j over n to
the power n times t over n.
To the power n,
we can now approximate by an exponential
function with an exponent minus j.
And then we're going to have to take
the whole thing to the power t over n,
to make up for
the extra term how to add and there we go.
Now you take a look at this and
say, well very good,
it's an approximation to be sure, but
it's going to be pretty good for large n.
We now have something in the numerator
which looks like a power of j.
Either the j falling is going to be
approximately enter of our j for
large n and modest j.
And then we have an e to
the minus t over n to the power j.
Well let's group the power j's together,
purely algebraically.
And now in the numerator,
in their own brackets we have n
times e to the minus t over n.
The whole to the power j in
the denominator, we have j factorial.
Now, a student might well be forgiven for
saying, okay, here's where you
algebrate manipulations and
strange things are happening and
I don't see where this is going.
But at the end of all of this when
the dust has settled, what have we done?
An inclusion-exclusion sum on the left is
approximated by a power over a factorial.
You say, oh wait a minute, that's
exactly what the Poisson sieve required.
Let's formulate this.
If the thing in the numerator in their own
brackets on the right, if that behaves
like a constant say louder, then I've
got exactly a Poisson sieve paradigm.
And here we go.
If n times e to the minus t over
n is some given constant lambda,
remember what do we have
that you can play with here?
Well, we can play with
a number of purchases t.
Remember n is some large but
fixed quantity, we can play with
the lambda that's a constant I can choose.
If I'm going to play with
a number of purchases,
then let's rewrite this
expression in terms of t.
By taking logarithms of the two sides and
then reassembling things,
I find that t is n times
logarithm of n over lambda,
the logarithm is to the natural or
Napier base.
If a number of purchases satisfies n
times logarithm of n over lambda or
the nearest integer to it,
then the inclusion-exclusion
sum sj behaves like a power
of lambda over a factorial.
And bingo, we've got it,
we've got a Poisson sieve.
Now if this is the case, let's quickly
run through the calculations and
then run,
run the slide over what we've discovered.
What would be the probability that
we acquire every q point?
This is the good event.
Well that's an inclusion-exclusion sum,
but the Poisson sieve is going to tell us
that this is going to behave
like e to the minus lambda.
If t satisfies n times log of
n over lambda then the chance
of getting all the coupons
in your t purchases is
approximately e to
the power of minus lambda.
Of course,
because I'm greedy, I want to have a high
chance of getting all my purchases.
This e to the power of minus lambda stands
in the role of a confidence parameter.
I would like it to be high, near one,
that gives me a lot of confidence
that with this many purchases,
I've got greedily all 14 Gilbert and
Sullivan playbills.
Let's take a look at what
it says more generically.
What are the chances that
exactly k of the playbills
stubbornly refused to be
obtained in my t purchases?
So at t purchases I have acquired
n minus k of the playbills but
there are k of them which I have
not sadly been able to get.
The Poisson sieve tells us immediately
that this is going to be approximately e
to the power minus lambda times lambda
to the power k over k factorial.
Let's put some numbers on this
just to settle the concepts.
At this level,
we should take a look at this and
say, I have a problem which was
not very complex in statement.
The analysis was tricky and
ended up with inscrutable sums which I
had no feeling for but the Poisson sieve
says each of these sums behaves like
this very simple Poisson character.
And that can immediately now allow
us to draw conclusions from this.
So let us say that I want a 90%
chance of getting all the playbills.
There are 14 playbills at hand,
how many purchases do I need?
Of course that's the million
dollar question.
How much money am I going to waste in
searching for this Will-o'-the-wisp?
If I want a 90% confidence, then I
want my e to the power of minus lambda
to be above 0.9 or lambda to be about 0.1.
And if lambda is 0.1 then the number of
purchases is t, per our beautiful simple
prescription, should be n times log of n
over lambda, n is 14, lambda is about 0.1.
And you find that I
need about 69 purchases
to guarantee with a 90% confidence that
I've acquired all 14 original playbills.
What if I want a much higher degree of
confidence, though I am a Gilbert and
Sullivan fanatic?
I really want all of them,
what if I want a 99% chance?
How large will t have to be?
If my confidence e to the power minus
lambda has to be 0.99 then lambda is 0.01.
T, n times log of n over lambda with n 14,
lambda now 0.01, now clocks in at 102.
I'm going to have to pay a price if
I want an incredibly high confidence.
I'm going to have to
buy a lot of playbills.
And of course, of the last very
many of the merchandise pieces I'm,
I'm purchasing are all hunting for
the last elusive playbill.
And as you know from your experience,
the last item that you haven't got yet
is going to take you the most time.
And that's where we've
got to expend our time.
So if I want a 99%
confidence to get 14 items,
I'm going to have to buy more than
a hundred pieces of merchandise.
Admittedly, this is a little whimsical and
I must apologize for my indiscipline.
I wanted to show you something weighty and
portentous and boring, internet security.
But I thought, this is fun and
I couldn't resist it and it tells a story.
And it shows you how we can implement
the inclusion-exclusion ideas elegantly
and simply.
This concludes this lecture and
now we'll go on to summarize what
we've discovered in this last tableau.
And in the summary, I'll then show you
where these discoveries lead today and
to the kinds of rich
applications that they inform.
