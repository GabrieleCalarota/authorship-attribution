Once we have a sample space in hand,
the next questions is,
what are the events of interest?
Events in the formal theory
are called measurable sets.
This is a bit of a misnomer because
a measure has yet to be specified.
It is going to come and
we call that a probability measure.
But we will anticipate
the provision of the measure and
call events measurable sets.
And we'll use a language interchangeably.
So, for us an event is a measurable set.
And what a measurable set is,
is a particular kind of
subset of the sample space.
A subcollection of idealized outcomes.
Now, naturally we'll be interested in not
just a single event, a single subset,
but many possible conceivable events or
measurable subsets.
So what kinds of events
are of interest to us?
Well, naturally enough we would like
the entire sample space to be an event,
because after all if you perform
the experiment some outcome,
some sample point emerges.
We would also like to be able
to take events and combine them.
For example, I'd like to say,
this event or
that event, or
formally the union of two events.
I would like to say, this event and
that event, the intersection of events.
All I would like to say not deceive it,
the compliment of events.
In other words, starting with some
basic events of interest to us.
We would like to construct and
conceive of more complex events obtained
by the ordinary set theory operations.
Now the simplest way to prescribe
this is to pick two operations,
say differences and unions.
And prescribe everything
in terms of them and
then all the other set theory
operations are inherited from these.
So we would like to conceive
of complements of events and
consider those to be new events.
We would like to consider unions of events
and consider those to be new events.
And poolings compels us to look at
not just units of two or three or
a finite number of events, but possibly
a countable infinity of such unions.
Now why an infinity of
operations you might ask.
Surely in the real world we don't
deal with an infinity of operations.
Now the answer is twofold,
one, prudence tells me that
I should not a priori constrict
my range of possibilities.
We've only seen examples where
in a conceivable experiment
I can think of an infinite sequence
of events that could be of interest.
For example we discussed in tableau
three the experiment where one
tosses a coin repeatedly until two
successive faces are the same.
Now, in such an experiment,
the experiment could,
in principle,
be carried on indefinitely without bound.
In such a space, I could conceive
of there is events of interest.
For example, the ibit that
exactly four tosses were seen.
Of course this would mean that we obtain
a sequence like a tail, a head and
two tails, or a head and
a tail and two heads.
Well that is surely a bonafide event.
Well I could say what if five tosses
exactly are required, or six,
or seven, or in general n tosses
where n need not have a bound.
Now you want to construct a new event.
The event that four or
more tosses is needed.
Well you see that this event can be
constructed by taking an infinite,
innumerably infinite union of the events
that exactly four tosses were needed,
or five or six, and so on, ad infinitum.
So Poolens tells us that it'd be wise for
us to expand the space of possibilities
to admit of a potential infinite
number of set theoretic operations.
Now the moment we have
something like this.
It transpires by the ordinary
rules of set algebra
that immediately if I have
a collection of events,
then I can take set differences,
I can take symmetric differences,
compliments, unions and
intersections in any order whatsoever.
And do a countably infinite number
of them and still get events.
The collection of all such conceivable,
measurable subsets or
events is what we'll call
the algebra of events.
And we will denote it by the stylized,
uppercase script letter F.
Now, when you say an algebra,
we use the term advisedly.
We can do things like unions,
which stand in the role of addition.
We can do things like intersections,
which stand in the role of multiplication.
This is beginning to look
like an ordinary algebra.
If it walks like a duck, if it quacks
like a duck, well it's got to be a duck.
If it adds like an algebra,
if it multiplies like an algebra, then
manifestly it is an algebra, and we will
without further ado call it an algebra.
Now formally, because we are allowing not
just a finite number of operations but
a countably infinite number
of operations in principle.
It transpires that what we're looking
at is, you can think of it as
an algebra on steroids,
it allows an infinity of operations.
Formally, such structures
are called sigma algebras.
The lowercase greek letter sigma
drawn from the German zuma.
Standing for really a countable
number of operations like addition.
Now this is all very abstract, and
of course, in the next tableau
we'll start putting some color and
some, some rich structure around
this in the form of applications.
But while we are building structure,
it is wise and
useful to add colloquial language
to the picture so that we can
picture things easily, add color to it,
see it in a comfortable light.
So here is some notation and
language which makes this, this abstract
picture perhaps a little more palatable.
We'll begin, of course, with the idea
of subsets of the sample space.
So we have an underlying
abstract sample space,
omega, of which everything
is going to happen.
In such a sample space I'm going
to pick subsets of interests,
these are the events.
We will use, generally speaking,
though again we will not slavishly adhere
to convention if it is wiser to switch,
but in general,
we will use upper case latin letters,
at the low end of the alphabet,
A, B, C, D, etc,
to denote different possible events.
And of course, in such settings,
it is frequently useful to draw a picture.
A Venn diagram can help us visualize
inter relationships between these sets.
Excellent, now when one
performs an experiment.
Some outcome, little omega transpires,
this is a sample point.
That little omega could be inside
some set of interest to us,
an event of interest to us.
If that is the case, we're imagining
this chance experiment being performed,
it's a thought, a Gedanken experiment.
If an outcome of the set
arises from the experiment
then we will very naturally
say that this event occurs.
Very colloquial language, but
it just means the collection of sample
points which comprise that set a,
which is the event under consideration.
Now, of course if one does the experiment,
some sample point or
the other will happen.
And therefore the space itself, omega,
is what we will call the certain event.
The performance of the experiment
will result in some little omega, but
little omega is manifestly an element
of big omega by definition.
And therefore big omega occurs.
It is certain to occur.
By the same token, in an informal vein,
we will talk about the empty set
as the impossible event,
because the empty set has got no elements.
And so no outcome of the experiment
can possibly lie in the empty set.
Now to go a little bit further, let's take
a look at interactions between sets and
between events.
Suppose A and
B are two events of interest to us,
and represented schematically
in Venn diagram.
And suppose A and B share no elements.
The intersection of A and B is empty.
A and B are disjoint.
In such cases we will say colloquially,
that A and B are mutually exclusive.
The idea here, of course,
again is very very visual.
Is that if one conceives
a fulfillment experiment, and
an outcome omega transpires,
if omega is an A,
then it cannot be in B,
because the sets are disjoint.
Likewise, if it is in B then
it cannot possibly be in A,
again because the sets are disjoint.
And therefore the occurrence of
the events are mutually exclusive.
Every use of ads, mutually exclusive
on occasion as a synonym for
a disjoint pair of sets.
And now finally of course we can for
general events A and B.
We can conceive of forming the unions,
we will call in colloquial language
a union is a disjunction an or.
And we will say, A or B.
We can conceive of the intersection of
these two events in colloquial language we
will say the conjunction of A and B.
And given an event A,
we can conceive of its negation.
Its complement, and
we will simply say not A.
