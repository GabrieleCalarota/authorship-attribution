The definition of independence
is formidable to say the least.
And, a student might be forgiven for
a feeling of despair at checking
the bona fides of independence
when you have a large collection of
events, possibly infinite in number.
Fortunately, in the simplest and
most natural of the settings in practice,
independence falls into our lap
virtually transparently for free, without
the necessity of any checks whatsoever.
This is a setting familiar to us from
long experience with coin tosses and
the throws of a die,
of repeated independent trials, leading
to an idea of a compound experiment
that we shall call a product space.
So, let's go back directly
to the coin toss game and
the example we looked at earlier.
We look at a toss of a coin three times
and configure three events, A being that
the first toss results in heads, the, B
being the event the second toss results in
a tail, and C the event that a third
toss results in a head, we concluded
we are in elementary calculation,
that in fact A, B, and C are independent.
Let's try to extract what there was in
this very simple setting that is key
to the entire idea of independence.
The idea is captured in
the concept of independent trials.
To get a right understanding
of what is going on here,
we are going to have to introduce
a certain amount of notation.
So, bear with me while we start by
putting together what is at play here.
There are 3 trials.
What does it imply?
Well, let's try to identify
what happens trial by trial and
we're going to introduce some notation and
we're going to color code it to
keep the ideas plainly visible.
So, there was a first toss.
Call this the first trial.
This first trial results in a, a face for
the coin, which is either head or tail.
In other words,
the first trial results in an element
from an alphabet of two possibilities,
heads and tails.
Let's call this alphabet gothic A.
And let's color code it green.
Just keep in mind that green for
our purposes for
this slide represents the first trial.
Now, this is a chance
experiment because the outcome
of this trial is not preordained.
We will naturally think of the coin
as fair and allocate an atomic
mass of one-half to each of the two
possibilities, heads or tails.
Green heads or green tails for
the first trial.
Likewise, the second trial results
in again two possibilities.
It turns out to be the same possibilities.
This is a setting of
repeated independent trials.
But, to keep the trials firmly in view and
separate from each other,
let's call this alphabet now, B.
Gothic B represents again a head or
a tail, color coded now blue,
to say okay, this is a visible indicator.
They're talking about second trial.
Again chance driven,
we allocate an atomic mass of one-half,
again to the singleton set
consisting of blue h or blue t.
The third trial, yet
one more chance to a possibility.
From an alphabet, let's call it Gothic C,
identified now in a maroon color.
Again, Gothic C happens to
have the same alphabet, but
let's identify it in color in maroon,
as a maroon h and a maroon t.
And again, we assign atomic probabilities
one-half to each of these possibilities.
Okay, so we made a big forward roll
about a very simple setting, and
we introduced some apparently
formidable notation here.
But bear with me.
The chance experiment overall involving
tossing the coin thrice gives
rise to a compound experiment.
And in this compound experiment,
the sample space is a space of triples,
identified now, color coded by trial one,
trial two, trial three.
Green, blue, maroon.
The moment you talk about an order triple,
we're talking about a Cartesian product,
formally speaking,
of Gothic A with Gothic B with Gothic C.
Ordered triples are the sample
points of this compound experiment.
It doesn't suffice to tell me
what happened to the third trial.
If you just say heads, well that doesn't
tell me what happened to the experiment.
The experiment requires a specification
of each of the three trials.
In other words, triples are sample points.
And therefore, we're now dealing
again with a discrete setting,
in fact a finite setting
of eight possibilities.
And therefore, it suffices to
specify the probably measure.
To specify atomic mass function.
The atoms here are sets
of ordered triples.
What should I allocate
to each ordered triple?
Naturally the coin is fair.
I want to allocate
a probability one in eight,
which I identify as a product
of the individual atomic masses.
A green one-half, a blue one-half and
a maroon one-half.
We've decomposed the atomic
mass probability into
a probability of individual atomic masses
corresponding to each of the trials.
This is what at heart we mean
by a repeated independent trial.
Of course, the listener looks at me and
says, well, you're just making a lot about
a statement that one-eighth is one-half
times one-half times one-half.
Eight is two times two times two.
But it's more, it's much, much, much more.
This apparently innocuous
arithmetic factorization is at
the heart of this deep and
subtle concept that we call independence.
Let's build our events on this framework.
What was A?
The event was that the first
toss resulted in a head,
which means ordered triples where
the first element element is a green H.
The next 2 elements,
a blue second element and
a maroon third element
are completely unfettered.
They can take any of
the four possibilities,
head head, head tail,
tail head, and tail tail.
But the first element in
the triple has to be a green h.
This means that the latter two
elements are completely irrelevant to
the specification of the event A.
A is completely determined
by one specific subset
of the alphabet Gothic A of results for
the first trial.
The event A is completely specified by,
in fact, a very simple subset,
a subset consisting of a single element,
green H.
Likewise, B is an event
completely determined
by a subset blue t of
the alphabet Gothic B.
And finally, C is an event
completely determined by a subset,
maroon h, out of the alphabet Gothic C.
This was the heart of independence.
The events A, B and
C are determined by individual trials
which are repeated and independent in
the sense that a product measure for
the conjoined or
the composite compound experiment
is opting by a product of
individual mass functions.
Let us immediately take
this understanding and
put it to good use in
an abstract framework.
Let us begin with the simplest of
these frameworks where we have two
independent trials.
