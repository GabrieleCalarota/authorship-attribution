We turn our attention over
a period of time of trading
to a setting where we have
an underlying portfolio.
A distribution of wealth across stocks and
we are going to keep
that portfolio intact.
In other words, at all moments of time
we want the distributional wealth
in the stocks to be governed in these
proportions, a1, a2 through a sub m.
This is sometimes called a constantly
rebalanced portfolio because when you
initially started your wealth and
you spread it out across the stocks.
At the end of a days trading the stocks
are worth different amounts and
so we have different amounts
invested in different stocks.
What we then do promptly at
the end of the next days trading
is to move resources around.
So that again all the stocks have got
resources allocated in
the proportions a1 through am.
One at the end of the day and we do the
same thing again rebalance the portfolio.
So that the end of the day the
distribution of stocks the allocation of
stocks stays in the same proportion
as given by the portfolio choice a.
Okay, so this is the setting of
a constantly rebalanced portfolio.
We are imagining of course,
this is not practical but
we are imagining that we
are doing this daily.
Now with this in mind,
how does wealth grow?
The growth of wealth is governed
by a succession of days
governed by stock price relatives.
Where a vector of stock price relatives
gives us ratios for individual stocks
of closing price on a given day to
the closing price on the previous day.
For a given stock price
relative vector will face X,
The wealth ratio,
the amount over that day,
that wealth is increased is given by
S(X) = a1X1 plus a2X2 through amXm.
Now let's see what happens when we have
a succession of days of investment.
So we could look at a day by number for
each day we're going to look at
the vector of stock price relatives X for
that day.
We're going to look at, how much wealth
grows, the daily wealth relative.
That is, the wealth at the end of the day,
to the wealth at the end of
the previous day, S of X.
And then we are actually going to look at,
how the wealth is growing overall,
over a succession of days.
So, let's start by setting
the stage as say day number zero,
numbered arbitrarily and let's say we
start with an initial wealth of $1.
W sub 0 the wealth at
the start of day one W0 is
1, now what happens on day one?
At the end of the first day's trading
each stock moves up or down and
is governed by a stock relative for
that stock.
The vector of stock relatives for
day 1 is a vector X but now the notation
is going to get a little more complex but
not too grievous I hope, right?
We're going to have to track which
vector of stock relatives for which day.
Let's use a superscript 1 to remind
ourselves that this is a vector
of stock price relatives for day one.
The is the vector of stock price ratios
at the end of day 1 to the end of day 0.
For that vector of stock price relatives,
the wealth relative at
the end of day 1 is S of X1.
Now what is S of X1?
It is a weighted sum of a's times X's but
the X's now are for
the particular vector of stock
price relatives for day 1.
Let's give it a short name, right?
The equation's getting to be a mouthful,
let's just call it S1.
So, S1 is the daily wealth
relative at the end of day 1,
it is the proportion wealth has increases
over the course of the first day.
And so what is your net wealth?
Well, your net wealth will be,
let's call it W with
a subscript 1 to tell ourselves
we're dealing with the end of day 1.
W1 says,
start with the initial wealth W0 and
multiply it by your daily
wealth relative for day 1 as 1.
Of course W0 is 1 so W1 is just S1 in
this case but let's build on 1 more day.
Now we have a new wealth,
1 has become something else it's now W1.
That is going to get reinvested
in the stock market and
what we are going to do is
rebalance the portfolio.
Because individual stocks have gone up and
down
the percentages in each stock are now not
in the ratio of the original portfolio.
Rebalance it by moving stocks around,
moving prices around,
moving allocations around until
we have the end of day 1.
All stocks are now in the proportions a1
through am we've rebalanced our portfolio.
And now we start day 2.
Now let's see what happens, day 2 is going
by and now that our set of chance or
occurrences.
It gives rise to a vector of stock
relatives called X with a superscript
2 now to tell ourselves we are dealing
with stock price relatives for day 2.
The wealth relative over the course
of the day, how much proportionately?
Has wealth increased or decreased
over that day is of course S of X2.
It's a weighted sum of the stock
price relatives for day 2.
Give it a shot and
call back name, call it S2.
This is the proportion that
wealth has increased over day 2.
How much in total?
Well, at [INAUDIBLE] the end of day 1,
I have W1 and so
you're net wealth at the end
of day 2 is W1 times S2,
the wealth relative for day 2.
Of course, now we can imagine
how we are going to do this.
Day 3 begins with an initial wealth
distributed according to my portfolio,
a1 through am.
The initial wealth now for day 3 is W2.
Day 3 is going to see a stock relative X3
that gives rise to a wealth relative,
S of X3 which I'll call S3.
And S3 will multiply my initial
wealth W2 to get my new wealth.
Of course, we're going to build
on this day by day by day and
eventually let's say we
look at day number n.
In day n, the vector of stock
relatives for the individual stocks
is now some other chance of an entity X
with the super script m catching the day.
The work relative over the course of that
day, the proportion wealth has increased
over the course of day n, Sn is S of Xm.
And what is a net wealth,
well at the end of day n you have Wn.
And Wn looks at what
are the starting point Wn
minus 1 at the end of the previous day.
Multiples it by the wealth relative Sn and
there you have it Wn then
is Wn minus 1 times Sn.
This gives us a very clean and simple
way of expressing how wealth is growing.
And of course we'd like to come to some
deterministic conclusions about on what is
happening.
This is what we will turn to next.
