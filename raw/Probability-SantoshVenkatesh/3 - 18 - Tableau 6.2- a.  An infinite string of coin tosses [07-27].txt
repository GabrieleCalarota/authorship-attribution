Tableau 6, Probabilities in simple
settings, Part 2, Continuous spaces.
In our development of
axiomatic probability,
we had identified three fundamental
elements which are part of the subject.
The sample space, the algebra of events,
and the probability measure.
And the crux of the development
depends upon our ability
to form a probability measure,
a set function,
which satisfies the fundamental axioms of
positivity, normalization, and additivity.
We saw how in discrete settings
this is possible by the simple
expedient of specifying a mass function,
or a distribution on the integers.
Now this is all that suffices for
most simple, commonplace examples,
but eventually, of course, we want to
move the theory to more complex settings.
What if the underlying
space is not discrete?
How should one go about constructing
a probability measure in such settings?
As always, we should build up
some more intuition by looking at
settings where these kinds
of concepts come into play.
And as always,
we return to the toss of a coin.
So, let's consider
the following new experiment.
Suppose one tosses a coin repeatedly,
without end.
Now, you understand of course, that this
is a fundamentally conceptual experiment.
It can never actually be
performed because it demands
that the coin tosses go on indefinitely.
But, one can conceive of doing this.
This is a bona fide gedankenexperiment.
Now once you have a chance
experiment like this,
how should one go about putting together
a probability space for this experiment?
Well let's start with the form basis,
sample space.
Well what is a sample space omega for
such an experiment?
Well naturally enough,
omega must consist of all
infinite sequences of heads and tails.
Well, okay, this is making my head hurt.
But in principle,
I can conceive of what that means.
Right?
Sequences of heads and tails.
Heads, heads, heads, tails, heads,
heads, tails, heads, tails, and so on.
And all such sequences.
It's a very large looking
number of possibilities.
But whatever it is,
I can conceptualize it.
The question now is, with this
complicated looking, fuzzy space,
is there a simple characterization of
subsets, of events in such a space?
And if one goes ahead and
characterizes subsets of interest for us,
how does one go about putting
together a probability measure
which is bona fide, meaning that
it satisfies the three axioms.
As is usual, sometimes
a different perspective brings a magical
clarity to an otherwise murky business.
Let's try to restate
the problem a little bit.
But first, the identification of heads and
tails is neither here nor there.
You could call a head anything you liked,
and
a tail anything you like, and
as long as there was a prior agreement and
dic, dictionary of translation, there
would be no ambiguity in what transpires.
Suppose we identify with heads,
or successes, the number 1.
And suppose we identify with tails,
or failures, the number 0.
Now once we have numbers,
our experience with mathematics through
high school and through early college
allows us to write down mathematical
expressions for sequences of numbers.
And at least formally, we can identify
the sample space under consideration here
as simply a sequence of digits.
Inevitably, we'll call
these digits letters x, and
we'll use a subscript to identify
the location in the sequence, x1, x2,
x3, x4, ad infinitum.
These x's are binary digits.
They must be either 0s and 1s,
because they represent heads and tails.
All such infinite
sequences of x's correspond
precisely to sanitized, idealized
outcomes of this chance experiment.
So omega is a family of
infinite binary strings.
Notice all we've done is renamed heads and
tails.
But the moment we have renamed it, and
in particular renamed it using numbers,
all kinds of other memories are triggered.
Perhaps we can find a different
perspective for this.
Let's, for example,
take a look at an event of interest.
So here's one.
Suppose A represents the event that
the first head occurs on the fourth toss.
Of course that means, and it settings like
this it is useful to build up an image
of what these outcomes are in our heads
before we put together a mathematical
codification which compactifies and
systematizes our, our instincts.
An event A like this means that
the first three tosses are tails.
Tail, tail, tail.
The fourth toss is a head.
And then following that,
I actually don't care.
It could be any sequence.
Well in terms of our new dictionary,
writing 1 for heads and 0s for
tails, this means that we're
looking at sequences x1, x2,
x3, x4 and so forth where x1, x2, and
x3 are 0, they represent tails.
X4 is 1, it represents a head.
And x5 onwards could be anything,
could be 0 or 1.
All such sequences, where the first three
elements are 0, the fourth element is a 1,
and then the remaining elements
can be arbitrary, are bona-fide,
card-carrying sample
points in the event A.
We have now identified very precisely
what the subset of interest is.
Sadly, we can't seem to
make much further progress.
This seems okay, this is good,
we at least found a mathematical compact
description for what this object is.
But how does one go about
constructing a probability measure
in this kind of setting?
This looks complex, difficult.
But as always,
a different perspective can sometimes open
doors that were hitherto unsuspected.
