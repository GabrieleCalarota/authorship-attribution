We have now built up two of the formal
elements needed for the theory.
We have an underlying abstract
sample space and a collection of
subsets of the sample space, that we
will call events or measurable sets.
To complete the picture, we now need
the idea of a probability measure.
So, we should begin by asking,
what are the properties we would
like a probability measure to have?
And, we should promptly reach
into our bag of experience and
see what intuition and
common settings tells us.
So, here a set of lessons from
a frequentist's point of view.
Let us go back to the experiment
where we talked about
the first throw in the game of craps.
As you recall in a game of craps,
we play by rolling or
throwing a pair of dice repeatedly.
In the first throw,
we start with two dice and
roll, and sum the face values.
The game proceeds by repeatedly throwing,
adding the face values and
continuing until it concludes.
Imagine that we have 50 crap games going
on at the same time, 50 games of craps.
And in each of them, the dice have
been thrown for the first time.
Here is now a listing of the kinds
of outcomes you might see for
this projected experiment.
We have ima, we are throwing the dice,
and we're summing the face values.
You'll observe that some of the letters
are in red and some of them are in green.
And now let us put this in
the context of the game itself.
The underlying chance experiment
here involves reaching and
throwing a pair of dice, and
summing the face values.
This means that the outcome
of the experiment
could be viewed as
an integer between 2 and 12.
The sample space, omega,
is a collection of
integers running from 2
all the way up till 12.
Now with a game of craps, the first throw
can be decisive in one of two ways.
One could win on the first throw.
A win on the first throw means that
one throws either a 7 or an 11.
Or, one could lose on the first throw,
which means that one throws a 2,
or a 3, or a 12.
I've tagged these in color to make
them visually clearer on the screen.
Now, one can also ask,
what about the event
that the game terminates
on the first throw?
Well, for the event that the game
terminates on the first throw,
either one has to win or one has to lose.
Winning and losing are mutually exclusive.
They share no outcomes and therefore,
the event of the game
terminates on the first throw,
is a union of these two events A and
B, and that gives rise
to the set of possibilities,
2, 3, 7, 11 and 12.
Very well,
now here are various events that
are possible in this underlying space.
Remember the experiment is, again,
just throwing a pair of dice once and
summing the face values, and now we
have 50 repetitions of this experiment.
A natural way to ascribe chance
to these events is to count and
look at the relative frequency
of times these events
occurred in a long run
of independent trials.
Independent performances
of this experiment.
Let us introduce a little nonce notation,
a temporary notation.
Let's use the greek letter
nu to represent frequency.
So, the frequency of an event,
we define to be the number of times
the event occurred, divided by the number
of times the experiment was performed.
Now, let's begin with
the sample space itself.
Well, every time one rolls a pair of dice,
one gets a number from 2 to 12,
and therefore,
in 50 performances of this experiment,
the sample space occurs every single time.
And therefore, the frequency of times the
sample space occurred is 50 divided by 50,
or 1.
The sample pic, space is certain.
What about the event that
one wins on the first throw?
In the 50 games that have been begun,
we noticed that there
are exactly 9 protagonists
who rolled a 7 or an 11.
And therefore,
it is natural to ascribe to the chance of
winning on the first throw,
the ratio of 9 to 50.
Similarly, 7 protagonists
out of the 50 threw a 2 or
a 3 or a 12, and therefore,
we assign to leave it B that one
loses on the first throw in craps.
The tentative chance 7 over 50.
And what about the chance of
terminating on the first throw?
Well, one terminates if one trow, throws
a 2, or a 3, or a 7, or 11, or a 12.
And there are exactly
16 such possibilities
in the string of 50 I've shown you.
Well, of course, 16 is exactly 9 plus 7.
An outcome which triggers termination
either belongs to the event that you
win or to the event that you lose.
And therefore, we find this very
interesting additive property.
The frequency of A or
B is a sum of the frequencies of A and B.
Three glorious, elegant, simple,
spare properties in this game.
The first, normalization.
The sample space is certain.
Second, every such ratio
is a non-negative number.
One cannot have a negative frequency or
occurrence.
We have positivity.
And that, if you have two events
which are mutually exclusive,
which are disjoint, which share no
elements, then the frequency of
the union is the sum of
the individual frequencies.
This is additivity.
These three principles now codify and
determine what a probability
measure should have.
