Tableau three,
chance in commonplace settings.
Part one, random sampling from
finite sets, balls and urns.
We are now about to begin our journey
in building a formal theory of chance.
In such circumstances,
these are the cardinal error to strive for
overly complex general settings in
which we want to build up intuition.
We should always try to start
with simple settings for
which we have intuition and
try to extract key principles,
which we can then quantify as
a basis of a formal theory.
The setting is much like what
went on in Euclidean geometry.
Practitioners began with an understanding.
Subjective to be sure
of geometry concepts,
the ideas of straight lines,
parallel lines, arcs.
And eventually, one managed to
abstract away the key ideas and
put together an axiomatic structure.
A mathematical conceit,
a model of reality where the trimmings,
which were superfluous to the logical
content were eliminated and
the essence extracted.
Of course, the true worth of such modeling
is that this leads eventually to outcomes,
which can be predicted and
tested and the ultimate wear out of
such modeling isn't a fit of these
predictions to observe reality.
Our development of the basic principles of
chance will follow similar guidelines and
naturally we will start with settings
with which we have immediate familiarity.
Dice, cards, coins and such like.
So this is the setting.
Eventually of course, we will want
to move on from simple examples and
look at settings,
which are more nuanced and subtle.
And we will come back to these
as the course progresses.
