Towards an axiomatic theory
of probability: The abstract
probability space.
Having explored chance in commonplace
settings to build intuition and
having gone through and
reviewed the language of set theory
with a view to giving us an alphabet,
we have now come to the point
where we can build a formal mathematical
foundation for the subject.
This is very much in the way
that in Euclidean geometry,
people built upon the intuition for
geometrical concepts from antiquity.
And about 2 million year ago,
a scribe in Alexandria
put forth a formal axiomatic
foundation for the subject.
And this of course
revolutionized the world.
This was Euclidean geometry.
The foundations for probability
should follow a similar approach.
But, remarkably for a subject of such
antiquity, the formal foundations
were only laid less than a century ago,
in the early part of the 20th century.
So, let us begin with our understanding
of ideas that we have gleaned from chance
in ordinary settings, to see what should
go into the foundation of the subject.
So, to begin,
each of the experiments we
looked at had three features.
There was an idea that when you perform
a chance experiment, there is an outcome,
and the outcomes together comprise
a family of conceivable outcomes.
Second, there was the idea
of an event of interest.
And we identified events with aggregates,
collections of outcomes.
And finally, there was a process
of ascribing a chance to an event,
a collection of outcomes.
In the formal theory, each of these
elements has a formal counterpart.
The collection of outcomes
is called the sample space.
The family of events are called
the family of measurable sets.
And finally,
the concept of chance is codified
in the provision of a probability measure.
In the usual nomenclature, we give some
notational names to these objects.
The sample space is generally represented
by the uppercase Greek letter omega.
The family of events of interest to us
is usually represented by a script f.
And the probability measure is represented
inevitably by the letter P in bold font.
These, if you wish, you can think
of as the Probabilist's Trinity.
