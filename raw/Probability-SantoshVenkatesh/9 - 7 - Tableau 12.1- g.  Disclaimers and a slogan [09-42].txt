What we have discussed so
far, is a principled way of
thinking about investment.
In a stock market of possibilities.
How to go about creating
an optimal distribution of wealth,
an allocation of wealth,
across different stocks.
In other words, an optimal portfolio.
But of course, you realize that we
have created a highly sanitized,
a highly simplified view of how real
stock markets actually function.
And so it would be appropriate to provide
some disclaimers as to the worth and
the value of all
the calculations we have done.
Now to begin, to optimize a portfolio,
remember we wanted to maximize
a doubling rate of wealth.
And so we maximize it,
by maximizing doubling rates
over all choices of portfolios.
To find, to extract the best portfolio,
the optimal portfolio.
In general,
this is a highly non-linear problem.
It's an optimization problem,
which involves a search
in a potentially high dimensional space,
with a lot of constraints.
Right, these portfolio vectors have
to have non-negative elements and
they have to add to one.
The function of optimizing
is highly non-linear.
This is not easy.
It is clear that it is going to
be computationally expensive.
For those of you who go on to take
a course in mathematical optimization,
you will recognize that the theory which
governs this is called Kuhn-Tucker theory.
And you'll find out that the optimal
portfolios will have to satisfy certain
conditions called Kuhn-Tucker conditions.
But, the take away message is what ever
we do this is going to be difficult and
expensive.
So if we want the very best possibility,
it's going to cost us time and effort.
But there's much worse,
in terms stumbling blocks for us.
To optimize the delta of a as
the doubling rates over portfolios a.
Remember this represented an expectation,
delta of a.
The doubling rate for a portfolio a,
was the expected value of
the logarithm of the wealth
ratio corresponding to some unknown
distribution for the stocks.
In general,
we don't know this distribution.
If we knew the chance
laws that governed life,
our life would be a lot easier,
wouldn't it?
In general, we don't know.
Nobody knows, what are the exact chance
laws which govern stock movements.
We don't even know these
approximately perhaps.
And if we don't know the underlying
chance law, the underlying distribution,
then we have no hope of writing
out an explicit computation for
an expectation according
to that chance law.
This suggests then, that perhaps we
have to find ways to infer, learn,
approximate underlying chance laws.
Older day, we had the realm of heuristics.
But, even if we thought we knew the chance
law, there's a further objection.
And that is that the assumption
that the market is stationary,
stochastically speaking.
In other words, you've got a chance law,
which does not change from day to day.
This is highly unrealistic.
Of course, stock movements in a given day,
inform what's going to
happen the next day.
If you're in a bear market,
then stock prices are generally dropping
before they bottom out and start rising.
If you're in a bull market,
stock prices are generally rising.
It is too simplistic to
assume that the laws
are, a stationary in time.
They don't change in time.
And two, that the laws result
in independent trials.
Each day potentially effects the next day.
Of course this leads to very complicated
chance descriptions of
an underlying chance process.
Is there a way forward?
If there's a way forward, then it's got
to take into account a reality where
stock price relative
distributions change with time.
And there could be
dependencies across the days.
Not just across stocks, but
across individual days of trading.
Now it turns out that the theory we have
developed, can be extended, expanded, into
a domain which deals with a construction
of what are called universal portfolios.
Which will work for
any collection of chance laws,
as long as there's some kind of,
asymptotic stability for the laws.
You understand, when the laws are allowed
to vary wildly from day to day,
then there's no hope.
So, we need to have some kind
of symmetry pulling things in.
These are called stationary,
or CORDIC laws.
But that takes us very far afield,
and of course we understand that
the technicalities now
are going to be significant.
Right?
But
now there is a theory of
universal portfolios,
which handles a large
basket of possibilities.
But this still requires expensive
individual optimization.
And now one more.
And this is the most significant
stumbling block to what I've told you.
We could, in some sense, handle changing
distributions, different distributions.
But what I've ignored in all of this
is that ultimately investment advisers,
stock brokers need to make a living.
They charge you to invest
in the stock market.
And typically, every time you change
an allocation of stocks,
you pay transaction fees.
Now it may be okay to pay a transaction
fee once at the start of the game.
It may be okay to pay a transaction
fee once in a long while.
But our procedure here required
constant re-balancing.
At the end of each day, you go ahead and
look at what is the worth of your
portfolio spread across the stocks.
Re-balance it so that the stock portfolio
aggregates are in the proportion
according to your choice of portfolio,
and we are to do this on a daily basis.
Every day is going incur
transaction costs, and
these transaction costs will sink
any possible gains you might make.
Okay, so there are all these
disclaimers to a general theory,
a warning that the theory, in isolation,
can't just be used naively.
You can't just go in, plug it in and
say there's Deus ex machina and plug it
in, turn the crank and out comes wealth.
No, life is much more complex than that,
right?
But what have we learned?
Now, it might be appropriate to conclude
this particular discussion with yet
another slogan.
And what is our slogan?
The law of large numbers
gives us a principled way
to think about stock peregrinations,
stock movements.
Gives us a principle way to think
about allocations of wealth
across various stocks.
And it gives us certain guideposts,
certain things which
are potentially feasible,
in terms of the growth of wealth,
of course in an idealized world.
In practice,
we move away from the idealism and
say, given that we have
a messy real world,
what can these principals teach
us about actual investment?
And again, the law of large numbers
tells us here are some principle
ways to think about it.
Here are some principled heuristics
that we can extract from the ruins.
Of course,
heuristics don't have a priori guarantees.
But in any case, a course of action
based upon principled heuristics is much
to be preferred over a course of action
based upon just random gut feelings.
Where there's no thought or
cogitation behind what we are doing,
what we are trying to optimize.
Of course, we could get more information
about the process and about our analysis.
If we wished, we could beyond
concentration, as I told you,
the, the law of large
numbers is a crude scaffold.
It tells us roughly where things
are going viewed with a heavy,
very heavy normalization, with a very
heavy thumb pushing down the scale.
But we can get much finer information
if you look closer to the limit points,
using the central limit theorem.
But we we won't take
the time to do that here.
I shall illustrate for
you, a final view of,
central tendency through the ages of
the bell curve, in an application
in a quite different context, next.
