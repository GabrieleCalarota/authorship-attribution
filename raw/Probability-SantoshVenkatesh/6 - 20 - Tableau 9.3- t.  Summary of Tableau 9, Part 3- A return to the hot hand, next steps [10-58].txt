We put a lot of hard work into this.
In analyzing a pro basketball
player's repeated shots at a basket.
If he had known that we were going
to go through this much trouble,
he would have probably packed it
up earlier and gone home, right.
But now let's go back and see what this
says about the basis of our statistical
test and the hot hand phenomenon.
Remember, the idea of the test was that
we were going to compare the observed
sequence of attempts at a basket with
a statistical version of a sequence of
coin tosses.
Our slogan, the more likely it is that
a success run of a given length is
observed in a sequence of coin tosses,
the less the reason to believe in
a mysterious and strange hot hand.
And what is the conclusion?
The quote is from a classical
book by Daniel Kahneman,
where he says the hot hand theory is
a widespread cognitive illusion
affecting all beholders,
fans, players, and coaches.
Now, this was based upon
an analysis which came out in 1985,
by three authors,
Gilovich at Harvard University,
Vallone and Tversky at Stanford,
where they analyzed an entire season of
the National Basketball Association's
data, looked at individual
players through the whole season.
And their conclusion,
the hot hand theory is a mirage.
Surprising?
But that is what the evidence tells us.
The three applications
we've looked at were hefty.
But they were informative,
they were beguiling.
They gave us information that
was not readily apparent to us.
And the best mathematical
theories do that.
They will take structures,
formalize them, provide predictions
which run counter to intuition,
which surprise, shock, amaze, beguile.
Now, the analysis was far from trivial.
It was elementary for
all three examples, but not at all easy.
But if a student goes back and
takes a look at what we did and
how we did it,
she will find that we use two tools of
the trade repeatedly,
two elementary principles.
First and foremost, additivity,
the whole is equal to the sum
of the individual parts.
This principle is, clearly sounds
very natural and reasonable.
But it sounds lightweight.
But after these examples,
perhaps our student will agree with me
that they are far from lightweight.
This principle is deep,
subtle, and nuanced.
At its heart,
additivity is about finding creative ways
of breaking up a problem into individual
pieces which are easy to digest.
Of course,
there is no absolute way of doing this.
Every problem has got its
own internal logic, and so
you have to sift through a problem,
think about it, analyze it,
before you perhaps stumble upon
the right way to look at it.
But once you do,
the problem tends to fall into your lap.
It opens up like a,
a flower bud opening in the sun.
Now, the second key element
was this idea of independence,
and in particular, the context
of repeated independent trials.
The moment one has repeated
independent trials,
at its heart,
independence is a rule of products.
Repeated independent trials
make the products transparent.
We almost don't have to worry
about the probability measure.
I know that's blasphemy, but
we almost don't have to.
All we need to do is take
the probabilities and multiply them.
But we have to be assured that
the events at hand are devolving
upon non-overlapping sets
of independent trials.
And the moment that happens, everything
is independent, and you're done.
We put these two principles to
work in three beautiful and
surprising contexts.
The first was in gambling.
And we picked a casino game,
the game of craps, to analyze it.
We had started out in our, in our second
tableau by looking at the game of craps
and looking at the first throw and
deducing that on the first throw,
one was twice as likely to win as to lose,
which would lead an unwary gambler to
think, well, this is a good game to play.
But an accurate analysis, taking into
account all the possibilities, shows
us that the odds of winning at craps are
actually just a shade less than one-half.
As casino games go,
this is not a bad game.
The odds are not dramatically
far from one half.
For example,
in certain slot machine games,
the odds could be only 35% in favor.
15% is in extra for the house.
But here,
the odds are very close to one half.
But they are, and
this is the critical point,
the odds are strictly less than one half.
This explains in part the arcane and
strange rules of the game.
The game's principles were designed
in such a way as to provide
a gambler with an incentive to gamble
by giving them odds near one half,
but making sure that
the house has an edge.
The odds actually of winning
are strictly less than a half, and
if the gambler plays long enough,
he is going to lose his shirt.
Our second example went into this
sublime and beautiful idea of genetics.
The Darwinian idea of natural selection,
with heritable characteristics
passed on through our genes.
And we looked at the context
of genes which are accidental
artifacts of the evolutionary process,
genes which are both recessive and lethal.
For example, sickle cell anemia or
the Tay-Sachs disease.
And we queried whether one could say
something about how the lethal gene
dissolved or devolved over time,
through generations.
And our findings were
that the lethal gene does
disappear from the population
across the generations.
Of course, the analysis was sanitized, but
it again carries at its heart useful and
fundamental information.
The lethal gene does disappear from the
population at large, but painfully slowly.
In many cases, the natural selection
process will take lots of time.
Here's an example of how
a lot of time is needed.
Of course, we could do more than
just say this qualitatively,
we actually had
quantitative prescriptions.
The rate of decay was
like the harmonic series.
Our third example was, went back to
this issue in sports psychology,
the issue of the hot hand.
And now we come back full circle
to our original question,
the basketball player who
hits many baskets in a row.
In many ways, this was the hardest
of the analyses we have done so far.
This required intense and
sustained logical endeavor.
It required persistence.
And as we recall,
it was done in a three stage process.
Breaking up the problem into a smaller
piece, breaking that up into a different
piece, and breaking that up finally into
a piece for which we have an answer.
Not at all easy, but
again, bear in mind that the tools
we used were completely elementary.
The difficulty was in the intrinsic
logical complexity of the problem.
And unearthing the right attack
was where all the effort went.
And having done all of, of that work,
sure, there was a lot of algebra.
This is the kind of thing that is
hardly edifying, hardly interesting for
most people.
But at the end of all of that,
we obtain a concrete prescription and
a concrete result.
And one of the conclusions
is that a naive appeal to
a mysterious hot hand is probably unwise.
To repeat William Feller's exaltation,
even strong faith must be
fortified by a statistical test.
And when one does a principled statistical
test on something like the hot hand,
we run into these issues of
the strange behavior fluctuations.
And out of these comes a completely
unexpected, a result in a completely new
and unanticipated direction.
And which, among other things,
takes credence away from
these mysterious phenomena that
we appeal to so instinctively.
This concludes our long discussion
of the interplay of independence and
additivity in problems of
chance in the world around us.
I hope you've been partly titillated,
partly enticed by these examples.
But now we should step back and
say, I now understand where
independence plays a role in probability,
why it is so central.
Where does it lead to next?
Quo vadis?
And so, in our next tableau,
in tableau ten,
we'll come back with
independence at the heart of
a fundamental application in
the modern day, that of polls.
And we'll start with polls.
And I will make the argument that
a poll is a ridiculous object.
It has no business working.
But somehow it appears to.
Why?
We will articulate from this beginning the
idea of where independence plays a role.
And out of these, we'll find emerging two
of the three fundamental distributions in
all of the theory of chance, the binomial
distribution and the Poisson distribution.
And our exploration will take us
from polls to bombs and queues.
And the distribution of
stars in the universe.
This is coming up in tableau ten.
