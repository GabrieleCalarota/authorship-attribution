With the concept of a probability
density under our belt,
it is now time to test our
understanding of the concept.
Recall that the idea of a probability
density hinged upon two elements,
positivity and normalization.
The function,
which is putatively a density,
has to be non-negative everywhere.
One can not have negative probabilities.
And the area under
the curve must be a unit.
Once a density function is specified,
much of the probabilistic content and
flavor is exhausted, and now it usually
becomes a matter of the calculus.
Dealing with the properties of a function
and computing various intervals.
So, with this under our belt,
let us promptly test our understanding
on three possible functions.
I've distinguished them by
calling them P1, P2, and P3.
And your task is to determine which,
if any of these, is indeed a density.
Pause the lecture, have a go at it, and
come back when you're ready to
see what the analysis unfolds.
So, let us begin with the function P1.
Now, this is a simple enough function.
I've given you a polynomial form and
its set and range, and of course,
one can certainly integrate this.
And if you do, you'll find
the variant of the curve is unit.
This looks promising, but
as the mathematician,
George Polya reminds us,
it is always wise to draw a picture.
And if we do, and we examine the graph
of this function, it becomes
manifest that this function actually
takes negative values in set and ranges.
And therefore, it cannot possibly be,
whatever it is, a probability density.
This function violates positivity and
therefore it is not a density.
Now let's move on then to
the function that I called p2 and
we promptly look at
the graph of the function.
From the point of view of positivity,
this is unexceptionable.
It is clear that this function is
going to be non-negative everywhere.
It is 0 in the negative
half of the real line.
Another positive half, both x and e to
the minus x are positive functions and
therefore you get a positive function.
The question now is,
is this indeed properly normalized?
Remember, the probability of
the whole space has to be a unit.
Is the area under the curve unit?
Of course, this leads to an elementary
integral in the calculus.
And let me just walk our way through this.
So we want to look at the area
under the curve of P2.
Now, P2 is 0 for the negative half of the
line, and therefore the only portion of
the integral that contributes is
in the positive half of the line.
And in there, the function is defined
as X times E to the power minus X.
Now, this looks like the integral
of a product of two functions.
And that reminds us of
an integration by parts.
Now, you remember the integration
by parts formula.
The integral of u times dv is u times v,
minus the integral of v times du.
Identify u with x, v with negative e
to the minus x, and we're home free.
Run the integration by parts
formula through this, and
we get two terms on the right.
The first term evaluates the function,
xe to the power of minus x,
at the limiting point of 0 and infinity.
And a look at a graph tells us
immediately that at both limiting points,
the function is going to be identically 0.
At 0, x contributes exactly 0.
At infinity, x blows up, it is true, but
e to the power minus x
squashes it with a firm hand.
And so we have no contribution
from the first term on the right.
The second term, well,
let's just reassemble it.
Combine the two minus signs and
obtain a simple exponential integral
over the positive half of the line.
Of course, you might recognize
here the exponential density,
but doing integration doesn't
cause us much distress.
It's a simple exponential integral.
We evaluate it, and we observe that the
area under the curve is exactly a unit.
We've discovered that P2 is,
in fact, a density.
This is an example of what
is called a gamma density.
It occurs in the theory of queues.
It occurs in the modeling of waiting
times for chance-driven events.
We will see it arise in a less mysterious
way when we get to tableau ten part two.
And we'll find a connection between
these densities and cues and
the distribution of bomb hits
in London during World War II.
Let's now proceed to the third example,
the function I've called P3.
We promptly plot its graph.
We find it's positive everywhere.
It looks a little strange to be sure,
but clearly,
the function is in fact strictly
positive everywhere on the real line.
And the fact that it decays so
quickly on both sides gives us hope
that the area to the curve is in fact
finite, and maybe if we're lucky.
Are they good?
Have they said their prayers at night?
There actually is actually a unit.
Now, let's go ahead and
try to compute the area under the curve.
Okay, so let's write down the integral
of P3 over the whole line.
Now P3, has got support over the entire
line, so write down the functional form of
the whole line, and we get what looks
like a formidable looking integral.
You have an exponential and
a second exponential in the export.
Ouch.
But, no matter,
let's pause for a little bit.
What we have is an exponential,
and in the exponent,
we have a difference of two terms.
Recall that E to the power of A plus B is
E to the power A times E to the power B.
We can separate the exponent into two
exponentials, and just write it out
as a double exponential
times a single exponential.
Now, this looks promising, right?
Admittedly it still looks complex,
but it is promising.
We might try a simple change of variable.
And let us try this without further ado.
Suppose you replace e to the minus x by t,
then dt is negative e to the minus x, dx.
And we see that the entire
integral immediately simplifies.
The integral becomes, the first term
is now, in the exponent, we have t, so
we have e to the minus t of
the first term in the integrand.
And then,
the second term just becomes negative dt.
That's beautiful.
What about the limits of integration?
When x goes to minus infinity,
e to the power minus x
goes to plus infinity.
And when x goes to plus infinity,
e to the power of minus x goes to 0.
So the integral limits go
from plus infinity to 0.
But of course there is a negative
sign in front of the integral, and
the negative sign will just cause
integral limits to flip, and
we can rewrite this integral as a game.
The common garden variety exponential
integral we already encountered,
we evaluated.
And we observe that this,
again, is going to be 1.
P3 is a bona fide density.
It arises in the characterization
of extreme events.
Things like flash floods, super
hurricanes, crashes in the stock market.
That is described by the German
mathematician, Emil Gumbel.
And he rightly remarked that
the river seemed to know this law.
It only remains to convince
the engineers of its validity.
All right, now, with this under our belt,
what have we got?
We observe that a density is
a function which is positive and
is suitably normalized.
Its antecedents are indiscrete
experiments where
we have a chance experiment which puts
mass at a discrete sequence of values,
and each value then has
a proper mass attached to it.
When we segue to the continuum as
a limit of discrete experiments,
then masses segue naturally
to mass densities.
And what then is a mass density?
It is something which has got
units of mass per unit length.
Mass is now scattered
densely across a region.
The key properties
are that it is positive,
it is non-negative everywhere, and
the area under the curve is unit.
So, this gives us a strong geometric
feel for probabilities in the continuum.
Of course, we pay a price.
And the price we pay is that an ordinary
sum has now become an integral.
But this should cause us no great alarm.
Yeah.
After all, the sign for
an integral, an S, an elongated S,
is there to remind us of
its providence as a sum.
We owe this to the mathematician Gottfried
Willhelm Leibniz, and on October 29th,
1675, Leibniz, one of the two fathers of
the calculus, wrote these prophetic words.
Utile erit scribit s pro omnia.
And translated from the Latin,
this means, it is useful to write
S for sum.
As the statistician, like Steal,
has admirably remarked,
few people have it so right for so long.
The proper abstractions,
the proper notations serve admirably
as a tool to focus thought.
And this notation of Leibniz for
an integral reminds us that
what we are appealing to is a basic
principal of additivity, a summation.
Ultimately, this idea of additivity runs a
remarkable thread all through the theory,
and it's manifested in the continuum
in the form of these limiting sums or
integrals.
