We're now coming to a right
understanding of what
independence entails when
we have three events.
Independence is a rule of products and
it's a rule of products if for
every arrangement of intersections
of these three events.
Before we proceed to abstract and
generalize it yet further.
Let's see, if we can draw some elementary
conclusions from this definition.
So to test our understanding I shall
begin by posing a couple of questions.
Dealing with formal set manipulations
of the events a b and z.
You should pause a lecture
when the question is post.
And see by scribbling on paper,
whether you can come to an understanding
of what is being asked.
And whether indeed you can make progress.
At this point you are going to
be using set manipulations and
the basic definitions,
additivity independence.
So, without further ado let's
start with our setting.
Recall a b and c are independent
events in some probability space,
if four rules of product are satisfied.
All four are required, if you want to
conclude that a b and c are independent.
We have seen, when we talked about
independents in the previous lecture for
a pair of events that a rule of products,
say the first equation, the probability of
a to section b is equal to the probability
of a times the probability of b.
Is maintained if one or more of those two
events are replaced by their complements.
In other words, the independence of a and
b is the equivalent to the independence
of a and b complement.
Which is equivalent to the independence
of a complement and b.
Which in turn is equivalent to
the independence of a compliment and
b compliment.
What if in a setting of three
independent events we compliment one or
perhaps more of the events?
We've already checked that rules of
products are maintained for pairs.
So our question here comes down to, what
if we look at the intersection of three
events, where one or more of the events a
b or c are replaced by the a compliments.
This would be a good time to pause
a lecture and consider, for example,
the probability of a into section
b into section c compliment.
And seeing whether you can, find a rule
of products emerging by manipulations.
You will need to use addativity.
You will need to use
the definition of independence.
And just a smidgen of common or
garden variety algebraic factorization.
When you're ready, resume the lecture.
Very well then, let's begin.
So we want to look at the probability
of a intersection b, intersection,
the compliment of c.
We immediately have
recourse to additivity,
though to be fair,
it is slightly concealed.
Think of the event
a intersection b as a new event.
[SOUND] This event can be partitioned
into two disjoint pieces.
That portion of a intersection
b that lies in c.
And that portion of a to section b,
that lies in c compliment.
Additivity tells us that
the probability of a to section b
can be decomposed into two pieces.
That probability of a to
section b to section c
together with the probability of a to
section b, a to section c compliment.
Move the second of those
to the right hand side and
you've got the identity
you see in front of you.
Well now,
well naturally enough on the right we have
probabilities of intersections and
independence immediately
allows these probabilities to
devolve into rules of products.
And so, by applications
directly of property one and
property four of independence,
we'll replace them by products.
We're now ready for
just a smidgen of algebra.
There are two terms on the right and
we find that the property of a times
the property of b is common to both terms.
Naturally enough, we factor these,
this product out, leaving you in ro,
round brackets,
one minus the probability of c.
Uh-huh!
But additivity rides to the rescue yet
once more, c and
c complement partition
the entire sample space.
And therefore the sum of the probability
of c and c complement as one or
in other words,
one minus the probability of
c is exactly added to five with
a probability of c compliment.
And there you have it, a rule of
products magically emerges again.
What conclusion can we draw from this?
Now, surely, we can now go ahead and
look at what happens if we replace,
let's say, b by the complement and
keep a and c.
Or a by a complement, and replace b and
c, but you of course understand that
replacing a or b by their complements and
keeping the others two unfettered will
give you an argument in exactly the same
lines, and a rule of projects will emerge.
The conclusion then is, if you rule a
products of these natures, with one, two,
three, and four, the four relations for
independence satisfied.
Then if you complement any one variable,
a new rule of products emerges.
But if is start with this and
you complement one more variable.
Let's say b and you look at a,
b compliment, and
c compliment again a rule
of products will emerge.
And if you complimented yet one more
time and you look at a compliment,
b compliment and c compliment
a rule of products will emerge like
a a creature from the chrysalis.
Again, you have products emerging for
all possible combinations and
therefore, here's a slogan.
Intersection probabilities factor
into products for any combination
of intersection of independendative
events or their complements.
The four basic results, the four basic
identities which go in independent,
will give you now a whole host
of intersection probabilities.
Very natural and very intuitive,
if a, b and c are independent
in the sense, in ordinary language, that
they do not impact or affect each other.
Then, replacing one by a complement or
two, or
all three complements, again, should not
allow them to influence each other and
indeed, this is what we have discovered.
