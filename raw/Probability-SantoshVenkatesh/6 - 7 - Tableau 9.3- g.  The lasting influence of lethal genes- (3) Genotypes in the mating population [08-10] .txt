So let us take stock.
We're dealing with expression
of a particular gene,
which exists in two alleles, two forms.
Uppercase A, which is dominant, and
lowercase a,
which is recessive and lethal.
The corresponding genotypes
are three in number.
The normal homozygous,
comprised of two uppercase As,
the heterozygous, carriers,
an uppercase A and
a lowercase a, and the sadly diseased
individuals, two lowercase as.
Let us say that in the mating population,
in the general population at large,
that these individuals are in
the proportion, u to 2v to w.
U represents that fraction of the populus
whose genotype is normal and homozygous.
In other words, two upper case As.
Twice v represents that proportion of
a population which is heterozygous.
In other words, an upper case A and
a lower case a gene in the genotype, and
w represents the sick individuals,
the individuals which have two
lower case as in their genotype.
So for instance,
if 60% of the population is normal and
homozygous, 30% of
the population is heterozygous,
and 10% of the population is diseased,
then u will be 0.6,
twice v will be 0.3, and w will be 0.1.
Why twice v?
You ask.
Purely for algebraic convenience.
It's going to turn out that
as we do the calculations we
are going to eventually get a stray
factor to the denominator, and
it'll be nice to cancel it out and
give us a nice clean compact answer.
We could just as well have
left it as v instead, and
then we'd have had to carry the two
somewhere else, but bear with me.
This will simplify the algebra
just ever so slightly.
Now let's move on from this, the pop,
picture of the general population to
that portion of the population that is
engaged in mating and creating progeny.
If an individual is infected,
has two lowercase as in their genotype,
they die early and therefore cannot mate.
In other words, two lowercase a genotype
individuals are forbidden from mating.
In any case our setting is as now follows.
We start with an overall population and
of this population only a segment,
the normal homozygous and
the hetrozygous who are carriers but do
not show visible evidence of the disease.
They themselves are not sick.
These are the only individuals
who are allowed to mate.
For simplicity they're going
to assume that both sexes have
these genotypes in the same proportions.
Now if this is the case, let's consider a
setting where we had 60% of the population
was normal and homozygous,
30% was heterozygous, 10% was infected.
Then, the 10% of infected
individuals cannot mate, and
that leaves 90% of
the population who can mate.
Of this 90%, 60% are normal and
homozygous, and so
they comprise 60 out of 90,
or two in three, or
two-thirds of the whole mating population.
And the heterozygous individuals,
the carriers,
comprise 30 out of 90, or
one-third of the mating population.
Of course what I've just described for
you is just a simple exercise
in conditional probability.
What we're really asking
is the following question.
If we actually remove the sick
individuals from the population and
we select an individual at random,
what is their genotype?
They will be normal and
homozygous from the mating population
with a probability of u
divided by 1 minus w.
The factor 1 minus w in the denominator
is just renormalizing so
that the smaller subset of mating
individuals now has got unit size.
Of course, this is just
conditional probability, right?
What we are saying is u over 1 minus w is
exactly the same as u divided by u plus
2v, because u plus 2v plus w is 1.
Likewise, the proportion of
individuals in the mating population
who are heterozygous is
twice v over 1 minus w.
All right, so our original probability
distributions are now adapted slightly to
take into account this new circumstance,
that sick individuals are unable to mate.
Now, in this mating population, we just,
we still have the two genes represented.
We have uppercase A and
lowercase a through the carrier.
Let's keep an eye on the frequency
at which the dominant and
the recessive and lethal genes appear.
If one selects a gene at random from
a selected individual who is mating,
well, if that individual is normal and
homozygous it will certainly be
a dominant normal upper case A gene.
But if the individual is a carrier, then
half the time that will be a normal gene,
and half the time it will be
the recessive and lethal gene.
Let's introduce a little
bit of notation and
keep this at the back of our minds, right?
So, the experiment is as follows.
We pick a random individual, male or
female, from the mating pool, which means
that they are either normal and homozygous
or heterozygous, and we select a gene.
We're looking just a little bit
ahead because in the mating process,
each individual will confer
one gene to the progeny.
So if you pick one gene out of
the pair which makes up the genotype,
then that gene will be dominant
with probability one, if the ge,
individual was normal and homozygous,
it'll be normal with probability one-half
if the individual were heterozygous.
Sum the two together, and
they get the proportion
of the dominant gene in
the mating population.
Likewise, if from an individual mate,
you select a gene, what proportion of the
time is that gene recessive and lethal?
Well, it cannot be recessive or
lethal if the,
the individual originally had
a normal homozygous gene,
because that individual does not
have a lethal gene to proffer.
But if the individual were a carrier and
their genotype was
of the form uppercase A and
lowercase a, then half the time, among
the heterozygous proportion of the mating
population, will a lethal gene emerge.
Let's call p the fraction of the dominant
gene in the mating population,
and let's call q, the fraction of
the lethal gene in mating population.
Of course p plus q must be 1.
Now, this gives us a goodly
setting to start with.
Our next step, of course,
is to put individuals together and
consider the mating process
which leads to progeny and
the passing on of
hereditary characteristics.
