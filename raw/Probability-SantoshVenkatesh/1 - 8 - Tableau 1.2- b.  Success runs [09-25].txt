Let us try to put our
understanding of the phenomenon of
the structure into a mathematical
model on which we can do analysis.
So, what is the basic setting?
We are tossing a coin repeatedly.
[SOUND] Say,
50 times or 100 times.
What is it we are looking for?
We are looking for consecutive
sequences or runs of successes.
Or heads, or one's in the sequence.
Let us say that a success run of
length five is occasioned if somewhere
in that sequence we have a run of five or
more contiguous heads or successes.
The key here is that we're not looking for
a success run in the first five
locations or the last five locations.
Or any five designated locations.
We're interested in the occurrence of a
success run of at least a certain length,
somewhere, anywhere in the given sequence.
Now, in settings like this,
it is always wise to step back and look at
the picture from a higher vantage point.
It is always useful to try to solve
a problem more generally rather than
one specific case at a time.
And accordingly this will now
necessitate some mathematical notation.
So let's begin.
What are the variables that you could
play with in such an experiment?
First, the number of tosses required.
Let us say we are interested
in n tosses of the coin.
Why n, you ask.
Because it is inconceivable that we
call a generic integer anything else.
Long tradition and
custom have inured us to calling
a general integer or a variable n.
So, accordingly,
let n be the number of tosses of interest.
What is another parameter of interest?
Well, the length of success
run that we are interested in.
The nominal length of
interest to us is five, but
more generally, let us say we're
interested in success runs of length r.
So, what is a setting?
We've tossed a coin n times and
we are looking for
a consecutive sequence
of at least r heads or
successes somewhere in that sequence.
And naturally enough, we are interested
in the chances of this occurring.
Let's introduce some more notation.
We are interested in success runs, so
let's call s the probability of obtaining
a success run of the desired length.
Now, s is parametrized by two variables.
One, it depends on the number
of tosses of the coin, n.
And two, it depends upon the number
of successes consecutive that we
wish to acquire.
Accordingly, let's introduce a subscript
n to keep track of how many tosses there
were and provide the length of
success run r as an argument to s.
We will say, s sub n of r or
slightly more casually,
s n of r to stand for the probability
that in n tosses of a coin,
one observes a success run of length
at least r somewhere in the sequence.
Now wouldn't it be nice if you
could find an explicit solution for
this problem for a general n and an r?
The level of sophistication we are at yet,
we don't have to have enough tools in our
armory to attack this problem frontally.
What I shall do for the nonce is
give you some numerical values for
these probabilities, for
specifically chosen values n and r.
Of course, I will hope that you
will be willing to take this on
faith at least temporarily,
while we await the building up
of a background sufficient to
allow us to analyze this question.
So, here is a table.
The table has three columns, as you see.
The first column allows r,
the length of the success run,
to run from 2, 3 up to 10.
The second column lists the probabilities
of obtaining a success run of the,
the, of the given length r for 50 tosses
of the coin as r varies from 2 through 10.
The third column gives you these
probabilities for 100 tosses of the coin.
Now, scan one of these columns up and
down, you'll notice immediately
that as the targeted length of successful
run, r, increases from two to ten,
that the probability of observing a
successful run of that length, decreases.
Very natural.
This is not what is surprising.
What is surprising is how big
these probabilities are for
even modestly large values of r.
Look at the fifth row of the table,
for r is equal to 5.
The targeted number of successes.
The chance of obtaining
a success run of length 5,
somewhere in a sequence of 50
tosses of the coin, is now 55%.
There's a better than 1 in 2 chance of
obtaining a success run of like
5 if you toss a coin 50 times.
Go back and examine your sequence
of 50 tosses of the coin.
Did you observe a success run length
of five or larger somewhere in there?
If you did,
it should occasion no surprise.
The chances are better than one in
two that you would obtain this.
The probabilities get even more
remarkably large for a 100 tosses.
The chance of obtaining
a successful run of length 5
somewhere in a sequence
of 100 tosses is now 81%.
This is where intuition bubbles.
It doesn't feel right
the the untrained intuition that
these probabilities are as
large as they seem to be.
Now with this,
with these numbers as background,
it should not come as a shock to
a student that if we look for either
a success run or a failure run, then the
probabilities are going to be quite large.
Here, for example, the chance of observing
either a success run or a failure run,
or both of length 5 in a sequence of
a 100 tosses clocks in at an amazing 97%.
Now with this, if our understanding if
we can cast at eye at the two sequences
we have, the sequence labeled
star looks quite unexceptionable.
We have a sequence of five failures,
a sequence of six failures,
a sequence of seven successes.
That seems quite reasonable in 100 tosses.
The odds of observing one or
other of length 5 is about more than 97%.
The sequence label double star on
the other hand looks distinctly dodgy.
There is no sequence of successes or
failures of length more than
four anywhere in that sequence.
And now it will not come as
a surprise to you to hear,
that the sequence label double
star was the one that I made up.
The sequence label star was what I'd
obtained by tossing a coin painfully and
repeatedly 100 times.
Now, the fact that there are challenges
to intuition at such elementary
levels already suggests a need
to develop a formal theory.
A mathematical theory which allows us to
put problems like this on a firm basis so
that we can logically analyze them and
see what the results are.
But such questions are not merely
of a whimsical or a toy character.
Such elementary sounding
problems have import
in problems of the physical
world around us.
And it will be good to immediately
give an example of how
such an elementary setting illuminates
something which is very common around us.
And so, without further ado, I will
turn to a problem in sport psychology.
