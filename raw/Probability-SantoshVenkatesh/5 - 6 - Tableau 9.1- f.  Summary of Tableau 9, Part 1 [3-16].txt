Let us now conclude our lecture with our
understanding of what we have discovered.
Summary of Tableau 9, Part 1,
a first look at independence.
Probabilistic, or mathematical, or
statistical independence
captures an informal idea.
Informally, we will say in ordinary
language that two events are independent
if the occurrence of one does not
affect the occurrence of the other.
This is informal.
The formal mechanism we will put
into process here is the following.
We say that events A and B,
in some probability space,
are independent if a rule
of products is manifested.
The probability A intersection B is
equal to the probability of A times
the probability of B.
Whenever you're asked to
check independence, or
verify independence, you should
probably write down that identity.
And ask, is this true?
Calculate each of the probabilities for
A to section B, for A, for B.
And ask, do we have an identity?
Do we have a rule of products?
If you do,
then the events are independent.
If you don't, they are not.
We saw that an immediate consequence
of this definition is that
if events A and B are independent,
then so are A complementing B.
And, so are A and B complement.
And so are A complement, and B complement.
It's very natural, very intuitive.
The independence of any pair,
it will imply independence for
any combination of complements.
We looked at another variation
on this problem by asking,
what happens if there's conditioning?
Events A and B are conditionally
independent, given an ancillary event C,
if a rule of products is manifested for
conditional probabilities.
We saw an example where this kind of
conditional independence arises naturally
in problems.
A high level idea of where this arises
is where in a problem, weighing many
initial choices, many pathways,
many roads that could be followed.
A road is chosen fast, and then you
follow the characteristics of that road.
This is the kind of setting where
conditional independence is
usually manifest within
the problem structure.
But, you bear in mind our slogan
that conditional independence
does not imply independence.
And, of course, nor does independence
imply conditional independence.
This concludes Tableau 9, part 1.
What we have done here is
establish the foundation for
a mathematical, clean, simple,
elegant definition of independence.
The second part of this tableau will take
this definition, and look at abstractions.
Look at settings where you have many
events, and try to find simple,
clean ways of figuring out when
independence is baked into the structure.
This will be the content of Tableaux 9,
Part 2.
