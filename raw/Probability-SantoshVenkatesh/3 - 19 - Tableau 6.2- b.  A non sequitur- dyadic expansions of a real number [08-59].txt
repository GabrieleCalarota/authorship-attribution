As I have said earlier,
a different perspective
can lend a magical clarity to
an otherwise murky and doubtful business.
Let me switch gears.
This is a non sequitur,
a Latin rare phrase,
means something that does not logically
follow from what preceded this.
Or at least,
it's an apparent non sequitur.
A, apparently a digression,
just to indulge myself, but humor me.
The word dyadic corresponds
to two choices: binary.
Okay, so, there's going to be
a binary game being played here.
Okay.
Let me start with some very
elementary fractional arithmetic.
Of course, we go back to the middle
school to understand this.
Let's start with the number one-half.
Okay, now we all know
exactly what this means.
1 is the numerator,
2 is in the denominator.
So this means exactly 1 times
2 to the power minus 1.
No problem.
Let's try another fraction.
Let's say, one-quarter.
One-quarter means 1 in the numerator
times 2 to the power minus 2,
which represents the denominator.
Now, since we started with the power of,
the negative power of 2,
let's build upon this
by saying explicitly.
That I have 0 times 2 to the power minus
1, plus 1 times 2 to the power minus 2.
And you'll tell me, okay so
you've given me a long-winded
description of one-quarter.
But bear with me, there is,
of course, a method in the madness.
Let's try another fraction.
What about the fraction nine-sixteenths?
Well, nine-sixteenths can be written
as one-half plus one-sixteenths.
Or another way of saying this is,
one-half, no contribution from a quarter,
no contribution from an eighth,
and one-sixteenths.
Now we see here the beginnings of
an incipient expansion of these
numbers on the left in terms of reciprocal
powers of 2 multiplied by 0s and 1s.
Now, to date, all the expansions
I've shown you are finite.
Right, could we conceive of
an infinite expansion in powers of 2?
But of course we could.
For example, what if we summed
reciprocal powers of even powers of 2?
For example, 2 to the power minus 2,
plus 2 to the power minus 4,
plus 2 to the power minus 6, and so forth.
Of course, you should write this down.
And stare at it.
And when you do, you'll see,
we recognize our old friend,
the geometric series, yet again.
And this entire sum, sums to, 2 to the
power neg, negative 2 in the numerator and
in the denominator,
1 minus 2 to the power negative 2.
The numerator is one-fourths,
the denominator is three-quarters.
One-quarters divided by
three-quarters is one-thirds,
and we've discovered an infinite
series expansion for one-thirds.
One-thirds is exactly,
via the geometric series,
one-quarter plus one-sixteenths,
plus one-sixtyfourth,
plus dot, dot, dot, dot, ad infinitum.
In other words, one-third is
obtained by summing negative powers
of even powers of 2 with no contribution
from reciprocal odd powers of 2.
Here's an infinite expansion in negative
powers of 2, for yet another number.
Now these expansions are beginning
to look like the ordinary
decimal expansions of numbers
that we have grown to be fond of.
For example, one-half,
we write usually as 0.5.
By this we mean, of course,
that there's an implicit decimal base,
a base 10 in the expansion.
0.5 means 5 times 10 to the power minus 1.
Similarly, one-quarter is 0.25.
And by 0.25 we mean,
2 times 10 to the power minus
1 plus 5 times 10 to the power minus 2.
What I've now shown you is
a similar expansion for
numbers, but we have replaced the base.
The base 10 has now been
replaced by a base of 2.
In which case the multiplying
things will be either 0 or 1.
And therefore in a base 2 expansion,
we could write one-half
more compactly as 0.1 followed
by an infinite string of 0s.
All this means is, that this mean
1 times 2 to the power minus 1.
One-quarter is 0.01 followed by
an infinite string of zeros.
And what this means is 0 times 2 the minus
1, plus 1 times 2 to the power minus 2,
plus 0 times all the other
negative powers of 2.
Similarly, nine-sixteenths is 0.1001
followed by an infinite string of 0s.
These are all terminating expansions.
One-thirds turns to be
of the form 0.010101,
01 recurs indefinitely.
Okay, now we say, oh yes, this is just
a different base representation for
real numbers.
And we scratch our heads and say, oh yes,
we understand that we can represent
a real number in any base we choose.
And in particular, if we choose
a real number x in the unit interval,
x is between 0 and 1.
Then x can be represented
in a dyadic expansion
by an infinite expansion
involving a binary digit, 0 or 1,
times 2 to the power minus 1, naturally
we'll call the first binary digit x1.
Plus a binary digit 01 times
2 to the power minus 2,
we'll call the next binary digit x2,
and so on.
And we'll compactly, we'll ride this
as a dyadic expansion as point,
a decimal point, of course,
in this case is a binary decimal.
Followed by x1, x2, x3,
x4, a string of 0s and 1s.
Oh, wait a minute.
This sounds similar.
This sounds like something,
which is triggering a memory.
Didn't we have sequences x1,
x2, x3, x4 and so forth,
representing the outcomes of my
conceptual coin toss experiment?
Against all odds,
we've discovered a pathway between that
conceptual coin tossing experiment and
an experiment where I give you
an expansion for a real number.
Now this is a starting point for
a very profitable and rich exploration.
So what have we discovered so far?
We've discovered that every real
number in the unit interval
can be represented by
an expansion in binary digits.
This is dyadic expansion
of the real number.
And conversely, any such sequence of
binary digits will result in a particular
real number by going through the sum
in the binary or the dyadic expansion.
This is interesting.
Not surprising because of our experience
with ordinary decimal expansion.
This is just a dyadic or
binary expansion in base two.
But, here's where things get interesting.
This strikes a chord in memory.
This reminds me of something.
Where have I seen infinite sequences,
x1, x2, x3, before?
Aha!
Wasn't that what I called
the outcomes of my chance experiment?
These correspond to
the idealized sample points
of the experiment where I toss
a coin repeatedly, indefinitely.
