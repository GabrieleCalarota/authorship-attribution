So let's take a look at
the setting we have so far.
How did we attempt this problem?
A listener can be forgiven for
feeling that this is oppressive, this was
difficult, there were lots of moving parts
and it was not clear where they came from.
And at the end,
something magical seemed to have happened.
But let's take a look at it piece by
piece and deconstruct what we have done.
We were interested in the chance of
a success run occurring somewhere
in sequence event tosses.
The first, and natural,
step was to seek a partitioning to
break it up into smaller pieces.
And the natural partition was
to break it up in terms of
the first success run events.
So, maybe that wasn't too bad,
though assuredly,
if someone without a background in this,
without preparation, had been thrown to
wolves as aware were, given this problem.
It might have been hard to unearth that
particular way of breaking up the problem.
But you will agree with me,
that at any rate,
once pointed out,
it is clear that this is an elementary and
perhaps even natural, maybe even
inevitable way of breaking up the problem.
Well, that was our first equation.
The second equation was
a little more complex.
We now had an issue of trying to
compute the probabilities f n, and
we related it to the probabilities u n,
the probabilities of the first or
subsequent success runs
terminating at trial n.
And it's not clear where this
line of thought came from.
If we deconstruct and look at the,
the, what we have done,
having the advantage of having done it,
it is clear that what we were
trying to do was understand success
runs terminating at a certain point.
And once we started thinking along those
lines, we found we could break things up
naturally, based upon where
the first success run terminated.
And that led to an additive principle,
and that additive principle led
to a convolution,
that expression in the middle.
Okay.
Now, so far so good.
In itself, it is not daunting.
Once you explain the principal,
you say, I get it.
I can see how this works.
But again, extracting the principal
from first principals without
advanced training could be very difficult.
That train of logic can be very slippery.
But what I would like to communicate to
you is that even though the initial step
might have been hard to find, once it was
pointed out, the execution was elementary.
It just required additivity.
Now, these two steps,
as I told you, are generic.
Nothing in these steps really
demanded that we were tossing a coin.
They could be doing any other experiment
which involved repeated independent trials
of the experiment with some events
which constituted renewals.
And if we had any such setting
then the first two equations
will carry through in total,
without change.
Where does the particular flavor of the
coin tossing experiment come into play?
Ah-ha.
It is in the third equation, and
it is here that we utilized what
we knew about coin tossing.
What was the logic behind this?
In many ways this was the most
slippery of the three pieces.
The principle was very hard to find,
because there were so
many things which we could have thought
of doing, which lead us into dead ends.
And what unlocks the logical
door here was an appreciation
that we're dealing with
a run of five successes.
And if we looked at a particular
run of five successes,
from trials N through the preceding
trial N minus 1 before it.
Then the understanding arose that you
can't have such a run of successes
without a success run terminating
at one of those five locations.
Admittedly, when I have to say something
like this, this looks like stony ground.
Until that last observation hits me.
And then I realize, that's an epiphany.
I've got, now, a recursion.
Admittedly, this is
logically really difficult.
And I would not be able to blame anybody
if they'd been unable to unearth
that particular logical string
which led to that equation.
But the moment it is pointed out to you,
then assembling the equation after
the fact is not hard at all.
It is additivity once more.
Beautiful, nuanced, subtle.
Now at the end of the day,
I have three equations.
All of them just require
an elementary use of additivity.
Never confuse the word
elementary with easy.
Elementary here just means you
don't need any fancy tools.
You don't need any big electronic widgets.
You just need very basic principles.
The difficulty here is not in the fact
that the technical demands are very high.
But, that the logic is very slippery.
And it takes time, effort, and
maybe a touch of genius to
extract the right approach.
But once you have the right approach,
executing it requires
nothing fancy whatsoever.
It is simply just the whole is equal
to the sum of the parts, repeatedly.
Now, this long put oration is
perhaps useful for a reader, for
a listener, to not feel oppressed
by the fact that this was so hard.
The pieces were hard to discover, but
once we understand what the key logic was,
then it's, it is easy to assemble.
Having put this much work in, we should
see if we can extract a little more juice
from this apparently stony stone, right?
How could we extend this idea?
Well we could go in two directions.
We looked at success runs of length 5.
Naturally enough, we would like to say
something about arbitrary success runs.
Say success runs of length r.
Where r could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
Well, what changes here?
On the first two lines, you remain intact.
They carry through in total.
Not, in nowhere the logic in those first
two equations did we exploit the fact
that the coin was fair, or that we were
dealing with coins at all, actually.
The fairness of the coin arises in
the third equation, and it arises in
the powers of 2, 2 to the power minus 5,
one-half times one-half times
one-half times one-half times one-half,
five successive successes in coin tosses.
2 to the minus 4, 2 to the minus 3,
2 to the minus 2, 2 to the minus 1.
Here's where the fair coin was used, and
here's where the number of
successes was relevant.
2 to the power of minus 5,
we were dealing with five successes,
success runs of length 5.
Well what happens if we replace
success runs of length 5 by success
runs of length r, for
some generic positive integer r?
Everything carries through in total, with
the replacement of 5 to the power minus 5
by 2 to the power minus r, and now we're
going to look at the block of r successes,
running from n through the r
minus one trials before it.
And then break it down
exactly the same way.
But now we have a new equation
with 5 replaced by r.
Oh, that was easy.
What if the coin were not fair?
Well, where does the fairness
of the coin come in?
Well, it comes in, in the powers of 2.
So, but it's for
one half if you have a biased or
bent coin whose success probability is p,
for some p.
Then, one half gets replaced by p,
2 to the power minus 1 gets replaced by p,
2 to the power minus 2 gets
replaced by p squared,
2 to the power minus 3 by p cubed,
and so on.
And now we've got a new equation.
Everything carries through
in total from this point on.
And so, from here, you can compute for
a given p and a given r.
All the values u.
From the u values we can
compute all the values f.
From the f values we can
compute all the values s.
And you'll now notice we've got
a general overarching principal.
And now a principal that has got
more utility than the simple,
controlled, limited problem
that we started with.
