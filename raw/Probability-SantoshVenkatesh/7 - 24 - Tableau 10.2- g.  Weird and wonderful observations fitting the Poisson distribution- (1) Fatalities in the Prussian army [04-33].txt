Some weird and wonderful observations
fitting the Poisson distribution.
Poisson himself thought of his
discovery as a little curiosity,
a little idea by way and apparently,
did not really use it very much.
The first person who put Poisson's
observation to good use
was von Bortkewitsch,
who in 1898 published
an intriguingly titled
book [FOREIGN] which translates
into The Law of Small Numbers.
It, this is a curious book.
You will find in it analysis
of suicide rates in children,
among women, fatalities, death.
Maybe there was morbid
streak in his makeup.
But, one [SOUND] absurdly remarkable
application that he focused on and
that has received a lot
of attention since,
is of fatalities of the large Prussian
army of the late 19th century.
Where people died as a consequence
of being kicked by their horses.
Hey, let's take a look at what von
Bortkewitsch actually looked at.
So, he followed 14 army core for
a period of 20 years from 1875 to 1894.
Now, each army core has got a large
contingent of troops in it.
And if you forward them for 20 years, you
have 14 times 20 or 280 army corps-years.
And each year you have one
particular army corps in that year.
You have a lot of individuals in
the corps, and there are many horses.
There are many opportunities for
being kicked and to die.
Okay.
So here,
sexist means we're getting kicked and
dying.
It's a little morbid, a little macabre.
But, if this is the case
then within each core year,
you have something like
a binomial distribution.
A large number of individuals.
A small chance p, hopefully,
of getting kicked by a horse and die.
And he finds that, in that period,
over 280 army corps-years,
there were 196 fatalities,
which translates into lambda
equal to 196 over 280, or
about 0.7 fatalities per army corps-year.
So, approximately one person,
in each army corp in a given year, died.
All right, now,
what other data is a part of this?
Well, here we go.
So, you have a table, a table in front
of you where on the left you have
the number of deaths per corps-year.
The deaths, column k, zero, one,
two, three, four, five, and so on.
Here, the observed frequencies are 144
army corps, corps-year, had no deaths.
That corps on that year had no one died.
91 army corps-year exhibited one death.
32 exhibited two deaths and so on.
Okay, if you think of these as,
a setting where we have rare events.
The chance of getting been kicked
by a horse and dying is small.
Army corps have got large
numbers of individuals in them.
We've got something that a binomial
distribution governing it.
And this is approximated
by Poisson distribution.
And what are the parameter
of the distribution?
Well, it's in lambda.
Lambda is 0.7.
If, in fact, the deaths were
governed by these probabilities,
with these frequencies,
these Poisson probabilities.
Then, the expected number of unequal
years with no deaths would be 280,
the total number of corps-years, times
the corresponding Poisson probability.
And that is listed on the third column.
And one thing that'll immediately strike
you is how remarkably good the fit is.
Of course, this does open up questions
about how one tests for good as to fit.
We will come to that a little bit later.
For our purposes now,
this shows us a beautiful effect of
the Poisson approximation to the data.
