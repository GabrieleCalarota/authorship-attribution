We now understand what
probability measure is.
It is a set function with
three basic properties.
Positivity, normalization, and
most important of all, additivity.
Before we move on and
examine instances of probability
measure in common situations and
look a wealth of applications, it will be
well to start with this formal framework,
this abstract framework, and see what we
can extract directly by simple arguments.
In other words, get the low-hanging
fruit while we may, okay?
So, let's start with a very,
very simple question.
What can we say about the probability
of the event which is empty?
Of course,
our instinct of reaction is to say,
well, the empty set should
have zero probability.
But you understand, in a formal theory,
we can't simply include information
from outside, as it were, right?
Think back to the axiomatic structure.
What do we have?
We have positivity,
the sample spaces got unit probability,
and there's this idea of additivity.
Nowhere in there is
a mention of the empty set.
So of course we could inset another axiom,
the probability of the empty set being
zero, for example, but it is not wise in
mathematical investigations to over burden
an axiomatic structure of assumptions.
Theories are most intuitive and tend to
have the greatest application and sway
when the assumptions are spare, few in
number, things which are easily checked.
So, it is preferable to get results like
this that the empty set has got zero
probability as a consequence of the
axioms, rather than assume it a priori.
So, let's see what we can
do with the axioms we have.
Let's pick two events.
Specifically, let A be the event
comprised of the entire sample space.
A is omega.
And, let B be the trivial event
comprised of the empty set.
Of course, these are very trite and
banal in many ways, but
there are certain obvious
natural properties.
What if we intersect these two?
Well, anything intersected
with the empty set is empty.
And therefore, omega intersection
of the empty set is empty.
Or in our set puritic language, the set
omega and the empty set are disjoint.
Ha, this strikes a bell with
the axiom of additivity,
which dealt with disjoint sets.
Well, to understand how to use it,
we have to look at the union.
But any set, when it's taken as
a union with the entire sample space,
will just give you the sample space.
The sample space contains everything.
Excellent.
Now let's see what we can do with this.
Begin with the axiom of normalization.
The probability meas, measure associated
with the entire sample space is unit.
But the entire sample space may
be decomposed as a union of omega
with the empty set.
Where these two objects, omega and
the empty set, are disjoined.
Additivity immediately tells us then
that the probability of the union
is a sum of the two probabilities.
But on the right,
we see the probability of the set omega,
which, by the normalization axiom,
must be unit.
And notice, just by churning
through the normalization and
additivity axioms, we've got an identity.
The book end on the left is one,
the book end on the right is one plus
the probability of the empty set.
Cancel one on both sides and
we are left, of course,
with an inevitable solution that the empty
set must indeed have zero probability.
As indeed, it must.
