Let's look at a slightly more complex
example, this time dealing with families.
So here is an experiment.
Imagine that a family is
known to have three children.
Begin by making the appropriate
assumptions for the probability space.
Pause for a minute and
see if you can construct the sample space.
Lets begin.
The sample space, well,
if there are three children, they are each
categorized by their gender, boy or girl.
So the sample space can be enumerated
by listing all possible
sequences of boys and girls.
A little b for boy, a g for girl.
Let's just say in order of age,
oldest first, youngest last.
And therefore, the sample space
consists triple, bbb, three boys.
Or bbg, the youngest is a girl.
Or bgb, the middle child is a girl,
the others are boys, and so on.
But ggg meaning all three
children are girls, and
there are exactly eight possibilities.
Let's put together some events here,
all right.
So these connotes nothing of particular
interest, except they're, they're,
they're crafted together to make a point.
So let A be the event that
the family has at most one girl.
What is this event?
What subset of sample points
is refered to by this event?
Well, if at most one girl,
then you can have at most one g appearing
in the string of three letters.
And therefore,
you have four possibilities.
No girls, and exactly one girl, in various
locations, oldest, middle, or youngest.
Let's look at another event.
Let B be the event.
The family has children of both sexes.
This means that the bookend sample points,
three boys,
three girls are eschewed, are eliminated.
And what remains leaves
you six sample points,
where all those triples contain
at least one b and one g.
It's easier in this setting to actually
look at the complement of these event.
What does B complement?
That the family contains
children of only one gender.
And there are two possibilities there,
all boys or all girls.
Excellent.
Now, let's put together
a probability measure.
The natural probability measure is,
in a combinatorial setting.
It is uniform across the possibilities.
And therefore,
we look at an atomic measure,
which puts mass 1 over 8 on each atom.
Each triple of genders has
got probability 1 in 8.
And here is now our question,
are the events, A and B, independent?
Pause and think about this.
Don't start the analysis yet,
but stare at the events.
See if you can get some feeling for them.
Does your gut tell you one way or
the other?
You, do you think they're independent?
Do you think perhaps
they are not independent?
Pause and think about it for a minute
before looking at the analysis to follow.
Now, lets then take a look at this.
Let's begin by writing
down the probability of A.
Now, its clear,
A has got four sample points and
therefore the chance of A is 4 of 8 or
1 in 2, okay?
But it's going to be useful to decompose
this using additivity as follows.
We can partition A into two events.
An event where there are no girls.
Well, this is an atom, a single thing
consisting of just a triple bbb.
In the event that there
is precisely one girl.
This gives you an event
with three elements in it,
where the girl is either the oldest,
or the middle, or the youngest.
And additivity tells us
the possibilities are going to add.
There's one for the first possibility,
three for the next.
And therefore, there's a one in,
one plus three or four possibilities,
which triggered the event A.
Okay.
We find that A has got
a chance exactly one and two.
Okay, so far, so good.
What about the event B?
Well, it is easier to
look at a complement of B
where the children are all of one gender.
There are two possibilities for
the children of being of one gender,
all boys or all girls.
Out of eight, therefore,
there's a 1 in 4 chance that
the complement of the probability occurs.
And therefore, by additivity,
the chance of B occurring
is 1 minus 1 in 4, or 3 in 4.
Well, for independents, I'm going to need
to check the joint probability of A and B.
What can I say about the probability
of the intersection of A with B?
What does A intersection B mean?
Well, it means that the family
has at most, one girl.
And that the family has
children of both sexes.
But this means that the family
has precisely one girl.
And that girl could either be the oldest,
the middle, or the youngest.
The event A intersection B consists
of a triple gbb, bgb and bbg.
It's got three possibilities.
The probability of this event
therefore is naturally 3 in 8.
But here is nub.
3 in 8 is decomposed as
1 in 2 times 3 in 4.
Which is the same as the probability
of A times the probability of B.
And perhaps a little more unexpec,
unexpectedly now,
a rule of products has
emerged from the rubble.
And we conclude by definition that
the events A and B are indeed independent.
Did this fit with your intuitive idea for
the problem?
If it did, then you had good intuition.
If it didn't, then this is going
to help you refine the intuition.
Now, having done this work, admittedly not
too much work, naturally now if we want to
see if we can expand on this and
apply it more generally.
How can we generalize this problem?
Well, naturally enough, we can replace
three children by, let us say, n children.
Why n?
Well, it is inevitable that I call
the algebraic variable anything
else, isn't it?
So suppose a family have n children.
And define the events A and
B just as, as, as given here.
Where A is the event that the family
has at most one girl and B,
the event that the family's
children are both sexes.
Are A and B independent?
Well, naturally, from this example,
I would be tempted to say hm, yeah,
sure, of course.
It's it makes clear that
they are independent,
though the structure looks
a little more complex now.
But we should be a little cautious, yeah.
So let's go ahead and
run an analysis through one more time.
This time, for a family with n children.
So a family's known to have n children.
The sample space now,
is a system of n tuples of genders.
Where each element is a boy or
a girl, b or g.
How many n-tuples are there?
Well, if there are just two children,
there are four possibilities,
bb, bg, gb, gg.
When there are three children, as we saw,
there are eight possibilities.
Four children give you 16 possibilities.
And in general with n children, there are
two to the power of n possibilities for
the distribution of genders
across those n children.
The events A and B are as advertised, but
the combinator, combinatorial measure now
we have assigns equal mass to
each sample point to each atom.
And therefore, the probability of
each atom is 1 in 2 to the power n.
A question again,
is our A and B independent?
And let's run through
the calculations again.
First, what can I say about
the probability of A?
Again, it is natural to decompose A,
partition it into two pieces.
An event, a singleton,
consisting of all boys and no girls.
And an event consisting
of precisely one girl.
Now, if it's precisely one girl,
that girl by age,
could be in any one of n locations.
And therefore,
the probability of the second event
is going to be n over 2 to the n.
Additvity gives it,
brings home everything else.
So the probability of A is
1 plus A over 2 to the n.
All right, what about B?
Well, again, let's start with B
complement, because that's simple.
In this setting again, B complement means
they are children of only one gender.
Which means all boys or all girls,
and there are no other possibilities.
And therefore,
the probability of B complement
is simply 2 and 2 to the power n.
Cancel out the 2 in numerator and
denominator.
It's 1 and 2 to the power n minus 1.
What about the probability of B?
Well, additivity arrives to the rescue.
It's 1 minus the reciprocal
of 2 to the power n minus 1.
Excellent.
We now still need to say something about
the probability of the intersection.
What is A intersection B mean?
It means that the family has at most
one girl, and children of both sexes.
In words,
it means the family has exactly one girl.
But that one girl, as we've seen,
can be any one of n age locations.
And therefore the probability of A
intersection B is n over 2 to the power n.
Notice how once you've understood
a small version of a problem,
frequently the mode of thought
informs generalizations abstractions.
At this point we've got
all the data we need.
Our question is, are A and B independent?
Now, if they are to be independent,
then we need a rule of products.
So we have to check our rule of products.
Is the probability of A intersection
B equal to the probability of A times
the probability of B?
The first step right it will property
wave to section, the property of a times
the equalitity of b on the left and
we're asking is this identity true?
Let's simplify it, okay?
At this point we're just,
we've exhausted all the probabilistic,
chance driven connotation,
it's all just purely Algebra.
Cancel out the factor of 2
to the power of n in the nu,
in the denominator on both sides.
Take the 1 plus n and
multiply out inside the round brackets.
And we ask, is n equal to 1 plus n minus 1
plus n over 2 to the power of n minus 1?
A little more massaging,
cancel n on both sides,
move the n over 2 to the power
of n minus 1 to the left.
And you ask, is n over 2 to
the power n minus 1 equal to 1?
And therefore, this is equal to
asking the following question.
Is it true that 2 to the power of
n minus 1 is equal to 1 plus n?
And we immediately see
that we have a problem.
On the left, we have something which
is growing exponentially fast with n.
On the right, we have something which
is trudging along very pedestrian,
linearly with n.
Clearly, this cannot hold all the time,
and in fact it doesn't.
Here is a table giving you examples of
small values of n to see what happens
to 1 plus n and 2 to the n minus 1.
1 plus n rules linearly, as n runs from
2 through 6, 1 plus n runs from 3 to 7.
But 2 to the n minus 1 runs two,
four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two.
It's blowing up very fast.
When you look at this table,
you find there's exactly one row where
the second and third columns are the same.
And that is when n is equal to 3.
We conclude that A and
B are independent if and
only if the family has three children.
This might be a little
surprising at first blush.
Among other things, this points out
the danger of jumping to general
conclusions based on limited
empirical evidence, right?
The case, n equal to 3, was special.
Oh, yes, I did this intentionally.
I do not apologize, right?
I gave you one special case, and
of course we were tempted to believe that,
that was typical, but it was not.
It was atypical.
In fact, that is the only case
where independence erupts.
All other values for n result in
non-independence, independent events.
We could dig a little more into this and
say, well, do I really feel, understand,
do I believe this?
Well, take a look at what happens,
for example, if n is large, right?
Think of your favorite large number.
Now, if n is large and you're told, for
example, that the family
has at most one girl.
Suppose you're given that information.
In other words,
you're given that A occurs.
Now, if A occurs, there's one possibility
in A which corresponds to no girl.
And n possibilities where n is big,
for exactly one girl.
If A occurs,
the overwhelming possibility is that
one of the impossibilities with one girl
is what really happened as the outcome.
And therefore, the chance of B
given A is actually very high.
Oh, after the fact, of course,
it becomes clear, it becomes transparent.
We understand why these events
influence potentially each other.
But this kind of analysis doesn't
expose the fact that with n equal to 3,
they actually don't in,
influence each other's chances.
That needed calculation.
And this is why the abstraction and
the definition are useful and important.
So, the moral so far, the idea so
far, is that independence is
governed by a multiplication table.
Independence is, at heart,
a rule of products.
If you want to check independence,
you need to verify that
a product identity holds true.
Our next step is to take
a look at the definition
itself and
look at a variation on that theme.
To expose flavors that were not
immediately apparent at first blush.
