So, let's begin by considering first,
the observed phenomena of Unimodality.
Now, ratios of successive terms
out to be very useful for
the binomial, and, therefore,
that leads us to consider whether the same
strategy might be effective here.
Let's try.
So let's consider the ratio of 2,
6s of 10s, of the Poisson distribution.
Notice I'm keeping the parameter
lambda hidden now,
because it's going to be fixed for
the duration of the slide.
So look at p of k divided
by p of k minus 1.
Well, p of k exactly is
the Poisson probability
up on the right of your screen.
To get p of k minus 1 all we do is replace
k by k minus 1 in that expression.
And simply write down the answer.
And now we got a ratio of
two Poisson probabilities.
An examination of the ratio shows that
there are several terms in common.
The e to power minus Lambda term
cancels the numerator and denominator.
Various powers of lambda will cancel and
various terms in the factorial
product will also cancel.
And the dust settles all that remains
is lambda in the numerator and
k in the denominator.
That's got to be hard to imagine
a simpler form for at a ratio.
Now, what can we conclude
from this expression?
Remember we are trying to show that
the distribution has a unimodel
character for
any choice of the hidden parameter lambda.
Now, if that is the case, then we first
expect the probabilities to increase and
then to decrease.
If there are ratio successes of terms
is to be bigger than 1, in other words,
if you're on the rising
age of the distribution.
Then, that means that lambda over k
must be bigger than 1, and therefore,
we conclude immediately that pk is going
to be larger than the previous term,
p of k minus 1,
precisely when lambda is larger than k.
Or another way of saying this.
The Poisson probabilities,
p of k, increase
when k is less than lambda and
then decrease there after.
In other words they achieve maximum
value at an integer just below lambda.
Excellent.
Now before we go on we
should take a little bit of
time to look at the expression
we've discovered.
And see if there's any more
information that we can milk from it.
So let's take a good look at
the ratio we've discovered.
A little smidgen of
algebra will do the trick.
So we've got a ratio of p of k over
p of k minus one is lambda over k.
Let's clear the denominators
by simply cross multiplying.
Multiply both sides by k,
multiply both sides by p of k minus 1, and
then we discover the basic,
the fundamental Poisson identity.
K times p of k is always equal
to lambda times p of k minus 1.
Of course the moment
we've got it in identity,
we realize that this identity is valid for
all non-negative integers k, and
therefor if we replace k by k minus 1,
the identity will hold valid.
And if we replace k by
k minus 1 throughout.
On the left hand side we'll get another
identity of the form k minus 1 times
p of k minus 1.
And on the right we'll get
lambda of p of k minus 2.
Of course,
we can generate any number of identities
by simple manipulations like this.
Now this is the key identity
characterizing the Poisson.
Let's say if we can derive simple
identities from this basic understanding.
Now recall that we
considered k squared times
the binomial probability, the case of
the binomial this turned out to be useful.
Let's preempt our need.
And consider an expression like this.
K squared times a Poisson probability for
some fixed lambda.
Can we find an alternative expression for
this in terms of other
Poisson probabilities.
Pause the lecture for a moment and see if,
following the lines of discovery that
we followed for the binomial, whether you
can simplify this and find an expression
in terms of p of k minus 1 and
p of k minus 2.
Restart the lecture when you are ready.
We want to find an alternative
expression for k squared times p of k.
A basic Poisson identity gives us
an identity for k times p of k.
In red lettering at the top of the screen.
Therefore, if you look at k squared,
and we decompose it into a product of k
times k, that brings us into an expression
of the form for which we have an identity.
Let's exploit this without further ado.
Right, split up k squared and
then group 1 k with the p of k and
take 1 k outside the round brackets.
Now, once we have this,
we have immediate and
fertile ground for
utilizing our Poisson identity.
Replace k times p of k by
lambda times p of k minus 1.
And immediately,
we obtain a new expression on the right.
K times lambda times p of k minus 1.
Well let's rearrange terms of the product
in the front, take the lambda outside,
the k inside, and focus again on
this time k times p of k minus 1.
Second Poisson identity for
k minus 1 times p of k minus
1 suggests that if we had,
instead of k,
k minus 1 in front of the p of k minus 1,
then we'd have a ready made
identity we could use.
Well naturally enough,
we start with the expression for k and
write it as k minus 1 plus 1.
Put this back into our expression and
simply regroup terms.
Okay, now the expression
is getting cumbersome.
It's getting longer and longer but there
is, of course, a method in the madness.
Observe that, the first step inside
the big round brackets gives
you k minus 1 times p of k minus 1.
The second term is just a Poisson
probability evaluated at k minus 1.
For the first term,
we've got now the second of
the Poisson identities we could use.
Replace k minus 1 times p of k minus
1 by a lambda times p of k minus 2.
And now we're almost there.
Simply re-simplify,
pull terms together, and
we've got ultimately
the expression at hand.
Lambda squared, times p of k minus
2 plus lambda times p of k minus 1.
Oh!
A casual listener, looking at this,
will say, well, look, you started with a
compact expression, k squared times p of k
on the left, and then you've created
this rather monstrously long expression.
Have we really made progress or
have we made things messier?
The key here is that the multiplying
factor k squared has not vanished,
and all the right we simply have
constants lambda squared and
lambda multiplying Poisson probabilities.
And the key here is simply that
normalization says that if we just sum
over all possibilities values for k.
On the left, we have what appears to
be an inscrutable expression, but
on the right, the Poisson
probabilities all will add to 1, and
this will magically and
gloriously simplify expressions.
