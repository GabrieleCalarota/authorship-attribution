The appearance of a bell-like character
in the binomial distribution suggests
that we take a closer look
at the popular bell curve.
The bell curve, in the popular language,
is more formerly known
as the normal density.
The terminology is due to
Francis Galton and Karl Pierson,
who coined it in the early part
of the 20th century because
of its apparent prevalence in all
kinds of sundry applications.
It was the normal curve.
It is also, in some quarters,
called the Gaussian density.
The first person to make
extensive use of this was
Carl Friedrich Gauss in the early
part of the 19th century.
So, we're all familiar
with the bell curve.
But what is it formally and
mathematically?
Well mathematically using Gauss's
notation, we call it a function.
Little phi of x.
Phi of x has got this particular form.
It's not completely
an elementary function, is it?
But it's not a difficult function.
What does it behave like?
What does it look like?
Now the graph is something
we're all very familiar with.
Casual acquaintance in
the popular literature
has made us very familiar with this curve.
It's got a bell-like character.
It's completely formally characterized
by the mathematical equation above it.
Now, this is the standard bell curve,
the normal density.
The listener who has braved the dangerous
bend tableau six part two will have
seen this make an incidental
appearance as an example of a density.
Now, we're going to put it to use.
Now, our observation that
the normal density, the bell curve,
could fit the binomial mass
function suggests that
probabilities might be
obtainable by computing areas.
In other words,
we've taken a communitorial problem and
reduced it to a geometric problem,
one of computing areas.
It will be useful to cap,
get some nomenclature here,
some terminology under a bell up
front before we go into the details.
So accordingly,
pick any point t on the x axis.
Our objective is to categorize the area
under the bell curve to the left of t.
In other words, the area all the way in
principle from minus infinity up til t.
Now, of course, today we can compute this
easily and simply on any modern computer.
Or one could even just type
it into the internet and
get a quick numerical free estimate.
So, this is easy to do.
Now, consider what happens as we move t.
If t moves to the left
towards minus infinity,
then the area decreases smoothly and
in the limit near minus
infinity area is exactly zero.
So the area increases from zero at minus
infinity all the way through t, and
as it goes past this point, as t
increases all the way to past infinity,
the area keeps increasing.
We've got a positive function,
and therefore the area will increase
as the endpoint moves to the right.
And then what happens as the endpoint
t goes to plus infinity?
Well at that point,
we get the entire area under the curve.
One of the reasons for defining
the curve in exactly this fashion with
a normalizing factor of 1
over the square root of 2 pi
is that the area has
been normalized to unit.
And therefore,
if we plot as a function of t,
what happened to the area from
t all the way to the left?
We find that the area increases smoothly,
starting at zero at minus infinity,
and then you have a smooth S-shaped curve,
and
the curve saturated an area
one at plus infinity.
In other words, we've described
a function of a real variable, t.
This particular function has a name.
It's called the normal
distribution function, and
of course,
it's got a symbol which characterizes it.
We've used the lower case Greek letter
phi to characterize the normal curve,
the bell curve, the density.
We use the upper case Greek letter phi
to characterize the distribution
function associated with it.
And formally, of course, an area in
the language of calculus is an integral.
So if you had any calculus,
you could write down an expression,
at least a formal expression, for
the distribution function big phi of t
as the integral from minus
infinity to t of little phi of x.
What does this mean?
Well, this just means and if you're
not familiar with integration, we just
take it to mean the area under the curve
from minus infinity up to the point t.
As you allow t to vary,
we get a smooth and
increasing function,
the distribution function of the normal.
Now, this is a starting point.
The idea is that the big phi, the
distribution function, captures an area
and we should be able to put that
to use in capturing probabilities.
Let us turn now to the properly scaled and
centered binomial variables.
Sn star given by Sn minus n over 2,
properly scaled to
square root of n over 2.
And we saw that Sn star has got
a particular mass function.
[SOUND] Let us see what
happens now if you attempt
to fit a properly normalized
bell curve through these points.
When we do that, we find really
a quite remarkably good fit.
A close examination shows that the fit
is least effective when n is small.
But as n becomes larger and larger and
larger and larger, the fit gets better and
better and better and better.
Quite alarmingly so.
Now, how do you compute probabilities
from a discrete setting?
Well, we simply sum up the mass function,
the atomic probabilities.
For example, if you're,
if we're interested in the question,
what is the chance that Sn star
takes values in a given interval,
we just sum up the masses
inside that interval.
If we ask,
what's the probability that Sn star takes
values no larger than some given t?
Then we just sum up all the masses
of Sn star up to that point t.
Of course, if t is considered to be
a variable then we get a function of t.
This is called the distribution function
of your scaled variable Sn star.
How does the distribution
function look like?
Well, let's think about it first.
A generic Sn star has got mass functions
which look like this bell curve.
You've got little things that go up and
down like this and then decrease smoothly.
Now, if you want to add up
the masses up to a given t,
then you're going to start
out near infinity at zero.
And then the first time you hit a mass,
the value jumps up by that mass
amount and then stays flat till the next
mass, it jumps up by that mass amount.
Stays flat.
Jumps up.
Of course the size of the steps are vary.
They depend upon the masses of
the atoms that you encounter.
But we ineluctably have a step
character for this function Fn star.
Of course,
we're going to try to approximate
this step function by simply looking
at the area under the bell curve.
But that is a smoothly
increasing function.
How do they compare?
Well let's take a look.
When n equal to 10,
you can see the step function for
Sn star, the distribution function,
and cutting through it the smooth
variation of the distribution function.
An oddity you say that the distribution
function of the normal is
already very close everywhere
to the distribution function,
the probabilities for
the standardized binomial.
As it increases, the fit gets better and
better and better and
at n equal to 100 the fit
is quite remarkably good.
The pictorial evidence is very,
very strong here, right?
This suggests that probabilities for
binomials viewed in
the proper scale may be well
approximated by appropriate
areas under a bell curve.
This visual evidence is compelling.
And takes us to this powerful
discovery from four centuries ago.
