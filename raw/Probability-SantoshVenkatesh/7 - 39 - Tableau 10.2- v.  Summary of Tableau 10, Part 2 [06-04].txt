The focus of this tableau
was on the introduction
on the new kind of times variable.
A Poisson variable with
a fixed positive parameter.
This variable takes values
in the non negative integers
in accordance with the Poisson
mass the probabilities.
P of k parameterized by lambda,
given in the Poisson form.
The form of the mass function is simple,
it has got a unimodal character so
it rises and then decays.
It has a got a probabilistic center of
mass or more formally an expectation.
A weighted sum which is precisely
the parameter lambda
characterizing the distribution.
And it has got an expected squared
deviation away from the center,
a probabilistic moment of inertia,
if you will, or
more formally and correctly the variance.
Also precisely lambda.
And at this point we've got
a complete categorization
of a new kind of chance variable.
The listener who has been
a little more adventurous and
has tackled the dangerous bend segments,
will have seen that some
elegant properties emerge from
this basic categorization.
So if one is a stability result,
that rules are concentrations of
merging of independent traffic streams.
The key result says that if x
1 is a Poisson variable, and
x 2 is another Poisson variable, and
the constitute independent trials.
Then this sum obtain emerging the two
is a new poisson variable and
its parameter is the sum of
the two individual parameters.
Now this stability observation was
interesting in its own right but
was key in the development of
the Poisson process which tries
to capture a sequence of random
arrivals in time or as pace.
All right, so formally the Poisson process
viewed as a time parameter t is a process,
a chance driven process, which for
every fixed positive value t.
Gives you a number of arrivals,
which is a Poisson variable with
a parameter, alpha times t.
Alpha here connotes the mean arrival rate.
Okay.
The process
is characterized by
independent increments.
What that means is the number
of Poisson points,
the number of arrivals
in disjoint intervals.
In disjoint regions,
quantitude independent trials.
How does one characterize such a process?
What is the underlying sample space?
We saw that one way of doing this was
to look at the inter-arrival times,
and we discovered that
the sequence of inter-arrival
times which characterizes the process.
Is a sequence of repeated
independent trials,
each trial conforming to
an exponential distribution.
What about the arrival times themselves?
Now, these connote the waiting
times of the process.
The time to the nth arrival,
s n, as we've discovered,
is another continuous variable.
Chance variable.
And it is governed by
a gamma distribution.
Now, at this point,
we've got a rather complete understanding
of the Poisson process and the kind of
ramifications of the basic structure.
Where does it arise?
Well we've seen a plethora
of applications.
The reader may well remark,
on the importance
of historical accidents seven
It is shaping of discoveries.
The Poisson distribution was
discovered by Sim√©on Denis Poisson.
Originally as an approximation
to a binomial distribution which
arose naturally in the characterization
of verdicts in jury trials.
And the poisson distribution then
arose originally in poisson's
derivations as a curious
little approximation.
But this curious approximation
went on to have a life of its own.
And over the next couple of centuries, it
became that this approximation of Poisson.
Captures not just rare events as an
approximation to a binomial, but stands in
its own right as a critical component of
something which captures random arrivals.
And this then leads to things
like waiting times, queues,
congestion control, spacial processes,
whimsically for example, the distribution
of bomb hits in London, or
the distribution of
stars in the firmament.
Now this concludes tableau ten part two.
At this stage we'll take stock and
go back to the questions that we
raised in part one of this tableau
when we talked about the binomial
distribution and the setting of poles.
The listener should go back to
tableau ten, part one, revisit, and
summarize the key elements of
the binomial distribution.
And the polling applications
that engendered it.
This shall be the,
the topic of our next At this point
we will turn to the fabulous limit
laws which underly probability theory.
