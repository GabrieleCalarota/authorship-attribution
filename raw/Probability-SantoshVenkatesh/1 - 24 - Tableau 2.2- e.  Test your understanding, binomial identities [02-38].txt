Okay, now at this point,
we have examined the binomial coefficient
from many different directions.
We've extracted key identities, which
allow us to write binomial coefficients
in terms of different formulations.
We discovered two fundamental properties,
Pascal's Triangle and
the Binomial Theorem.
It is now time to test your
understanding of these concepts.
So let me give you now three problems,
each of which involves the use
of the Binomial Theorem.
Examine each of them.
See what the Binomial Theorem
says about each of them.
And discover three interesting,
fascinating, combinatorial identities.
Pause the lecture, and
when you're ready restart.
Now that you're back, let's start with the
first problem, 1 plus 1 to the power n.
Identify P with 1,
Q with 1 in the binomial expansion,
in the Binomial Theorem.
And when you do that,
you get the following expression.
A sum of binomial coefficients.
But because 1 plus 1 is manifestly 2,
that sum of binomial coefficients.
N choose 0 plus n choose 1
plus n choose 2 and so forth.
Until n choose n,
must be equal to 2 to the power n.
Here's your first identity.
Let's look at a second identity.
In this case, p is 1, q is minus 1.
When you take powers of q, you will get a
minus 1 to the power times q to the power.
But negative 1 to a power is plus
1 where the power is even and
minus 1 where the power is odd.
Now we get an alternating sum
of binomial coefficients.
But this alternating sum must in
fact be 1 minus 1 to the power n or
0 to the power n.
In other words, this alternating
sum must be identically 0 or
we've discovered a new identity
involving these coefficients.
One last time,
it is said p is one-third and
q is two-thirds,
we end up with one more item today.
You can now see how a whole table of
identities is waiting for you to discover.
Just plug in suitable values for
p and q and out comes an identity.
