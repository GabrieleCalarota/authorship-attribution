Now that we have seen the law of large
numbers in play in a continuous setting,
it is now time to test our understanding.
Now we saw how the law of large numbers
emerged by following the analysis for
the binomial distribution.
And it should not at all come
as a surprise to you to.
Come to the realization that the law of
large numbers is going to work whether
the setting is discrete or is continuous.
So, here is a problem for you to try.
Start now with variables which
are intrinsically arithmetic,
in other words,
they take integer values only.
We're going to look at
repeated independent trials.
And now the continuum is replaced
by a discrete set of possibilities,
the integers.
Suppose now that these variables
have a common expectation, mu, and
a variance sigma squared.
Your task is to follow along with the
analysis we have already accomplished for
the continuous setting.
And recreate a law of large
numbers in the arithmetic setting.
So what will you need?
Well, first off, densities are going
to give way to mass functions.
Instead of having a mass density
spread across a continuum.
We now have probability masses
attached to each integer.
So let's say we've got a mass function
in our usual notation, p of k, denoting
the probability that a generic chance
outcome x takes the integer value k.
k, of course,
runs through all possible integers.
The idea of expectation now.
Will have to become a weighted sum,
and natural enough, the integral,
in the continuum,
segues into a sum in the discrete domain.
And of course we've got to look
at a weighted sum of values.
This is the natural generalization of
the idea of an arithmetic average.
Value weighted according to chance.
And finally,
we're going to need an idea of an expected
squared deviation from the mean.
In other words, the variance.
And the variance again will
have a very similar expression
with a natural replacement of integrals
by sums, densities, by mass functions.
So.
Have at it.
And when you're done,
let's conclude with a sliver.
Now, what you discovered really is
that we have a law of large numbers in
the continuous setting and
in the discrete setting.
And so, here's a slogan.
The law of large numbers
is going to come into play.
Any time we have repeated
independent trials, and
we form a sum of these variables,
these variables should have a common
expectation and a common variance.
And in general settings, we will take the
ideas of center of mass, and the idea of,
of a moment of inertia, and
extend it with suitable linear operations.
And so, at the higher level, the story is,
when or where we have an expectation and
a variance, and we have repeated,
independent trials.
We're going to expect to see
a law of large numbers emerge.
