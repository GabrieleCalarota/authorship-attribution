The ideas of Bose and
Einstein have had a decided impact.
And they come into play
in commonplace settings.
Everyone today is familiar
with the laser pointer.
The green laser pointer which is used for
presentations, but
also is on evidence in for
example soccer matches,
where oh, less reputable
members of the audience point
lights at players on the,
on the field, to distract them.
Here's a very commonplace idea.
The idea of a laser.
The existence of lasing abilities
is due to the fact that photons
follow those Einstein statistics.
They're identical particles
which are non interacting, and
many of them can land coherently
in the same beam, and form for
example, a coherent beam of light,
a laser.
One also finds this at play
in more exotic circumstances.
For example, Bose-Einstein condensates
have a particular important role to play
in this phenomenon called superfluidity,
and also in superconductivity.
Though, of course, in the interest of full
disclosure, the ideas have to be adapted.
Because in those settings,
the particles actually do interact, and so
one needs to massage
the basic understanding here.
But with all these successes,
as early as 1926, it was clear that we
still had difficulties explaining things
at the level of electronic fluctuations.
For example,
the Bose-Einstein statistics don't explain
why the specific heat of electrons in
a metal at room temperature is what it is.
The classical theory predicts
that one should need a lot fewer
electrons in the current for the observed
specific heat than one actually gets.
This is strange, and of course,
when one gets data that are not in
consonance with the theory, that suggests
that one has to revisit the theory.
The same kind of puzzling
phenomenon arises when
one looks at emission
currents at room temperature.
And again there are gaps between
what the theory says and
what we actually observe in practice.
In 1926, a couple of years after Bose and
Einstein published their paper,
Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac,
two more giants of 20th century physics,
proposed a new model to handle
things like electronic fluctuation.
Fermi is famous through, for example, the
Fermi labs, which now sadly is defunct.
Paul Dirac was a brilliant British
physicist and mathematician.
They wanted to explain these phenomena,
things like,
why do electrons apparently not
subscribe to the Bose-Einstein model?
And so they needed a key insight.
Now, what was their key insight?
Again, the setting is, we have a random
placement of n balls into r urns.
The balls, of course, are your particles,
whatever flavor they are.
The urns represent physical states
of being of these particles.
Following the insight of Bose and
Einstein, Fermi and Dirac say, well,
we are going to consider these particles
as if they were indistinguishable balls.
But we need something more, and
this is what they happened upon.
What if the balls were exclusive,
snobbish?
What if each ball refused to
share an urn with a neighbor?
In other words, we are constrained to have
occupancies which could only be zero or
one.
No urn's occupancy could two or more.
This principle that urns could
be at most singly occupied
is called the Pauli exclusion principle,
named after Wolfgang Pauli.
So now we have a new model.
We have n indistinguishable balls, r urns.
And the additional Pauli exclusion
principal as a constraint.
No urn can contain more than one ball.
Think of this as a very
exclusive neighborhood.
Each ball wants its own house, and
it wants nobody else living with it.
Now, some things are immediately clear.
If each ball has its own urn,
then the number of balls cannot
exceed the number of urns.
In theoretical computer science, this is
sometimes called the pigeonhole principle.
You have a certain number of pigeons,
the balls, a certain number of holes,
the urns.
And if every pigeon is
to get its own hole,
then the number of pigeons cannot
exceed the number of holes.
Okay, so immediately,
we know that n cannot exceed r.
Okay.
In addition, we know that occupancy
configurations here, k1, k2,
through kr, are strings of zeros and
ones only, because no occupancy
number can exceed one.
It can only be a zero or a one.
Of course, then we conclude that the k1
through kr's are either zero or one.
And they must of course to add up to n.
All of the balls are accounted for
somewhere in the urn system.
Now, let's take a look at a picture.
And again, following Pauli's sage advice,
let's look at a simple model.
Two indistinguishable balls, four urns.
How can we distribute them in accordance
with Pauli's exclusion principle?
Well, here's an example.
Let's say urn 2 and
urn 4 contain one ball a piece.
This of course gives you an occupancy
configuration, zero, one, zero, one.
Now, let's tear at this picture for
a little bit.
A generic picture is
going to look like this.
Now, what does that mean?
It means that there are r locations,
in this case, four locations,
four urns, and
the moment you specify a ball has
gone into an urn,
then that urn cannot be reused.
In other words,
the placement of balls into urns is
a selection methodology which
selects which urns are occupied.
In this case, of course,
there are exactly four choose two
ways of specifying the two occupied urns,
and of course this is six.
And of course, we immediately generalize.
If we have a setting where you have
n indistinguishable balls, r urns,
balls are distributed into the urns
in such a way that no two,
no urn contains more than one ball.
Then this is equivalent to specifying
which n of the r urns are occupied.
And of course, there are exactly
r choose n ways of doing this.
Now we've come to a right understanding
of what the Pauli exclusion principle
constrains us.
We only have r choose n
distinguishable configurations.
Distinguishable occupancy numbers.
Now, once you have these, again, there
is no a priori reason to believe that
one particular configuration is
any more likely than another.
And therefore, we assume that all these
configurations are equally likely.
Now, what then is a chance
of one particular
occupancy configuration arising?
Well, it is the reciprocal of this number.
And so
we now have the Fermi-Dirac statistics.
The probability that if n
indistinguishable particles are launched
into r urns while satisfying
the Pauli exclusion principle,
the probability of
observing one particular
occupancy configuration is
the reciprocal of r choose n.
Bear in mind that the occupancy
configurations we are talking about here
must correspond to occupancies
which are either zero or one, and
of course, the sum must be exactly n.
All the particles must be accounted for.
Okay, this is all well and good.
But of course,
the true test of such a theory is
whether it is validated in practice.
And one finds in the 20th century
a triumphant vindication of this idea.
A whole class of particles,
called fermions in honor of Enrico Fermi,
fall into this bin.
From a physicist's point of view,
these are particles
which have one-half of an integer in spin.
They have half integer spins.
Examples are electrons, protons, neutrons.
These all are elementary particles.
An electron, for example,
is a spin one-half particle.
And of all of these have been
shown to follow these statistics.
More complex particles
also fall into this bin.
For example, the helium-3 atom.
Or the carbon-13 atom.
This then gives us a satisfactory picture
of a separate class of particles.
Of course, one understands that
these are elementary models, and
while they illuminate the big picture,
there is much more there.
Okay, and of course, to understand
the real statistical physics,
one has to figure out how these
particles interact with each other.
How the bosons flow to the fermions,
and vice versa.
Of course, then this gives
us the rich edifice which is
the modern day statistical
theory of the atom.
But for our purposes already
these elementary ideas, and
this is the take away message.
Simple ball and urn models,
variations on that theme already,
already elucidate, illuminate key
fundamental principles of modern physics.
