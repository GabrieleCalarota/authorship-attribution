The latter half of the 20th century, and
the early part of the 21st century has
seen an explosion in new drugs from
which have improved the quality of life,
and extended our lifespans.
But not all drugs are efficacious,
and occasionally,
there are serious and
debilitating side effects.
In countries at large,
there's then a policy question,
as to how to put into place
a regulatory process,
which balances the twin demands of need,
and safety.
This is typically done within
the province of a country in something,
like a food and drugs authority, an FDA.
In the United States, for example, when
a company files a new drug application,
it goes to the research arm.
The center for
drug evaluation, and research.
The process is long,
cumbrous, and expensive.
On average, the amount of time
it takes from a drug to be
conceived in a laboratory in a company,
and
to wind it's way to our pharmacy shelf,
on average,
it's about 12 years, and on average,
it costs about $350 million.
This is a big business, 'kay?
And many drugs, don't make it to the door.
Some drugs are discarded early in
the process because they're found to be
not efficacious.
And more seriously, other drugs are
discarded at some stage in this process
because they're found to
have serious side effects.
The process, for example, in the United
States goes roughly, as follows.
A drug is first conceived
in the laboratory, and
sometimes animal studies are done.
Just to,
to give you an instance at random.
The condition call osteoporosis,
deals with bone loss, and
afflicts a lot of people worldwide.
In the United States,
the number of people afflicted is
in the order of maybe 10 million.
And the cost of treating it, runs into
upward of 1 billion dollars a year.
This is expensive.
Now, a treatment for
osteoporosis was discovered
by understanding the hormonal mechanisms
that the body uses to control bone loss.
So, the human body secretes
a hormone called calcitonin,
which regulates bone loss.
A happy discovery, and
this is a fishy tale,
was that,
salmon secreted the same hormone.
But it turns out, salmon calcitonin,
when ingested by humans,
is 30 times,
as potent as human calcitonin.
So, now we have the basis, a suggested
direction for the creation of a drug.
And eventually,
it was created synthetically by
essentially copying the genetic signature
of a salmon calcitonin in the laboratory.
Essentially, all drugs
follow this kind of pathway.
There's a discovery process,
where a drug is posited,
maybe from nature, and it's created.
This is then, filed with the Food and
Drug Association for approval.
A new drugs application is filed.
In the United States,
it promptly goes then, if approved for
a clinical trial into what's
called a Phase I clinical trial,
where something like of the order of 80
healthy individuals are given the drug.
Of course,
there is full transparency here, and
they are told what the drug is supposed
to be doing, and what is known about it.
The idea of this first phase
in the clinical trial,
is to establish parameters, profiles for
the drug, and figure out what
its likely side effects are.
This process usually takes about a year.
If you emerge from this the FDA says,
continue, then you move to a Phase II
trial, where now it is much larger.
Something about the order of about
800 individuals to be solicited, or
maybe 300 individuals.
And these individuals are then tested for
efficacy.
Does a drug work, as advertised?
Or perhaps, more accurately, as hoped?
Are there any serious side effects,
which are immediately obvious?
So, if you tested on
about 300 individuals,
you're going to get a slightly
more confident pronouncement.
This phase typically takes about
two years, and if the company sa,
successfully navigates phase II,
then they move on to phase III.
Which is now a large clinical test,
testing of the order of 3,000 individuals,
and now you're seriously examining
whether there are side effect,
debilitating, or serious.
How does this drug
interact with other drugs?
This process can take three years,
from start to finish,
the process can take 12 years, and
cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.
This is very big business.
And in the process, a very large number
of drugs just fall by the wayside.
They turn out to be not very efficacious,
not work as advertised.
And occasionally,
have serious side effects
The process tends to work well,
except, of course, when it doesn't.
And occasionally,
there is a spectacular apparent
failure of the regulatory process.
One such recent example was, of the anti
inflammatory drug called the Viox.
It was marketed by Merck.
It was approved by the FDA in 1999,
and was a blockbuster.
This was an, a,
a a part of the family of, of,
pain controlling drugs is called
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
It used a particular new pathway
called a COX-2 inhibitor,
but the details don't matter for
our purposes.
To somewhat different from its mechanisms
from the way Aspirin works for
example, or Tylenol.
This drug was a blockbuster,
for example, the year 2003,
Merck reportedly made about $2.5
billion from the sales of this drug,
and then, in 2004,
Merck withdrew the drug from the market,
just ahead of being forced
by the FDA to do this.
Because of a discovery that
a drug caused an enhanced,
and serious cardiovascular problem in
a chunk of the patients who took the drug.
It is estimated that something like
a 100,000 patients who took the drug in
the previous years,
came down with severe cardiac conditions.
How, how, how could this happened?
I mean,
after this entire long regulatory process,
how could something like
this has slipped through?
Of course, you know,
sometimes errors happen
because of willful tweaking of the data.
In other words, with malice,
or forethought.
Sometimes, errors can happen
because of accidents.
And sometimes,
errors happen because life happens.
You say, absolute certainty in a chance
driven world is a will of the wisp.
It flutters here and here, and no matter
how hard you try, you can't grasp it.
It slips through your fingers.
Sometimes, it's just the nature of chance.
Another example from recent years was
the diabetes drug called Avandia,
marketed by GlaxoSmithKlein.
In this case, the drug, again,
was approved in 1999 by the FDA, but
they were concerns about its adverse
potential effect on cardiac function.
And in 2010 the FDA required
GlaxoSmithKline to restrict
the sale of the drug because
of these health concerns.
By 2013 the FDA had revised, and
overturned the original judgement,
they returned Avandia to the shelves,
saying, there is no evidence that
it causes unnecessary distress in a carda,
cardiopulmonary sense.
And again, we have this issue, where
a drug was examined over a long period of
time, a lot of data were collected, and
apparently, absolute certainty
wasn't within our grasp.
Of course, in both these cases,
the side effects that were
positive were very serious.
They were life-threatening.
So, how does drug testing actually work,
and does it really work?
