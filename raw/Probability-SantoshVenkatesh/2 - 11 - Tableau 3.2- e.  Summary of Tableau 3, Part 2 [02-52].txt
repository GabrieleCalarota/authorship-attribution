Let us conclude and
pull these strings together.
So, in summary,
small variations on the theme of balls and
urns are potent
in understanding how particles
in statistical physics behave.
The classical theory, due to Boltzmann and
Maxwell, treated particles as
if they were distinguishable.
What else?
It's so completely natural.
There's only one thing wrong with it.
It doesn't fit the reality
at the particulate level.
The more refined statistics,
due to Bose and
Einstein, describe this class
of particles called bosons.
And these particles are modeled as
if they were indistinguishable but
non-interacting.
And they occupy urns, but
there's no constraint on how many
particles can occupy an urn.
And these lead to
the Bose-Einstein statistics.
Another class of particles, the fermions,
the particle with half-integer spin,
these are modeled in distinguishable
balls, with the additional
constraint that the particles obey
the poly exclusion principle.
No two particles can be in the same state,
can be in the same urn.
And, a huge mass of, of nature is
explained by this class of particle.
All the particles that are known to nature
so far fall into either the boson or
the fermion category.
But of course this need not be
the end of the story, as more and
more exotic particles are discovered, as
richer and wilder behavior is discovered,
we might need, we might find evidence,
the need for a new theory.
Still another model of reality, but
that will have to wait upon the event.
In this part of the tableau,
we have articulated how we can
start with a very basic ball and
urn model which arises in
common place settings and
apply it in a rather sophisticated
setting, that of statistical physics.
And extract beautiful keen sights.
We now go back to the main thread.
Our understanding of how commonplace
problems lead ultimately to
a formalization of the basic tenets
of a formal theory of probability.
So we shall pick up the thread,
the skein again in part three of
tableau three, coming up next.
