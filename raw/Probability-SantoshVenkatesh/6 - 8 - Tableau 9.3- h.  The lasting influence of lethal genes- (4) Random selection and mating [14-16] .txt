Let's keep an eye first on
the mating population proportions.
Remember only the normal homozygous or
the heterozygous individuals can mate.
And they appear in the mating
sub-population in proportions
u over 1 minus w and 2 v over 1 minus w.
When you proceed to these your random
selection, the idea is as follows.
Select a male from the mating population.
Select a female from
the mating population.
And now, you've got a pair of parents.
We shall be very creative here and
simply bow to stereotype.
And represent the genotype of
the male in a blue color and
the genotype of the female
with a pink color.
Since both males and females are
restricted to either normal homozygous or
heterozygous characteristics.
There are four possibilities for
the pairs over genotypes.
Both are normal in homozygous.
The male is normal homozygous.
The female is heterozygous.
The male is heterozygous,
the female is normal in homozygous and
both male and female are heterozygote.
In the process of mating,
each individual proffers one gene
from their genotypical makeup.
And the two genes,
one from the male, one from the female,
will then form the progeny's genotype.
This is the genotype in the filial
generation, the child's generation.
Of course, all possible mixings
are feasible under the setting.
And so, the child could have
the normal homozygous AA genotype.
The child could have
the heterozygous genotype.
The child could sadly be sick and
have the lethal genotype.
The probabilities of these happening.
Let's use the same
notation we used earlier,
with the prime to tell ourselves
that this is the filial generation.
Let u prime be the probability for
the child is normal in homozygous.
2 of u prime be the probability
that the child is heterozygous.
At w prime, the probability
that the child is, in fact.
Now I haven't told you very much about
the probability space at this point.
I have been talking lightly
about probabilities.
But of course, underlying all of this,
there must be a chance experiment.
And here is where independence
plays a central role.
And independence here plays
a role in two places.
First, in parental selection.
And second, in the selection of the genes
from the individual parental genotypes.
Let's take this in turn.
So, the first experiment
involves two trials.
One selecting a male from
the mating population.
One selecting a female from
the mating population.
The idea of random selection implies that
these individuals are selected
independently and at random.
According to the probabilities on
the upper right of your screen.
So let's consider the four cases.
In the case where both male and
female are normal and homozygous.
Each of them has got a chance,
u over 1 minus w of anchoring.
Since males and females are selected
independently under random selection.
The probability of this is u over
1 minus w times u over 1 minus w.
I've color coded this to make it clear
where these probabilities are coming from.
One from the male, one from the female.
What if the male is normal and
homozygous and the female is a carrier?
She is heterozygous.
Well, in this case, the male has
got probability u over 1 minus w.
The female's got probability
2v over 1 minus w.
And again, independent selection
means we multiply the probabilities.
Likewise, if the male is a carrier,
the female is not an homozygous.
And finally, when both individuals are
heterozygous, both of them are carriers.
We have now got a stage where we've
got these a priori probabilities,
which set the stage.
Set the table, as it were.
This, these probabilities represent
the parental mixing probabilities,
under the assumptions that we have so far.
To get to the filial genotype,
we now have to select genes.
One from each member.
Okay.
Let's take this in turns.
To get a normal homozygous child, a child
with two uppercase A's in the genotype.
Well, this can be done with
any of the four combinations.
In all four combinations,
both parents have at least
one uppercase dominant normal
gene in they're makeup.
And therefore, all four cases can result
in normal homozygous child genotype.
What are the chances we
want to allocate here?
Naturally enough.
We're not thinking about
a conditioning setting.
We're thinking about the conditional
probability of a filial genotype emerging.
Given a particular
parental genotype make-up.
So let's start with the normal
homozygous child genotype.
There are four possibilities and
the arrows going from left to right
will tell you what's feasible.
What is the probability that starting
with two normal homozygous parents,
you get a homozygous child.
Well, each parent offers a dominant
upper case A gene with probability 1.
They do not have lowercase a genes.
And therefore,
their probability is 1 times 1.
We believe we, we assume
that selection of these individual
genes constitutes independent trials.
What about if the male
parent is normal homozygous,
the female parent is a carrier,
is heterozygous.
Then the male parent, proffers another
case a gene with probability 1.
The female parent proffers the uppercase
A gene one-half of the time.
And therefore,
the probability is 1 times a half.
Similarly, if the male is a carrier and
the female is normal and homozygous,
the probability is one half times 1.
And finally, if both of them
are heterozygous then each of them
has got a one half chance of
proffering the uppercase A gene.
And one-half times one-half
probability in that case.
Notice how the conditional probabilities
fall into a lapse as it were.
Just by reading out from left to
right what the circumstance is.
What about the child genotype,
which is a carrier,
which is a mixture of an uppercase A and
a lowercase a.
While in this case, if the parents
are both normal and homozygous.
It is impossible for
them to create progeny who's genotype is
anything other than normal and homozygous.
So there's a missing arrow
from the first case.
But the three remaining possibilities
can all create carrier individuals, and
the probabilities now are one time a half.
One-half times one and the third is
only one where a little tot required.
The third instance we have
two heterozygous parents,
each with a mixture of genes.
To obtain a heterozygous child,
one of them will have to offer
an uppercase A gene, the other will
have to offer a lowercase a gene.
Now this can be done by the father
offering the dominant gene,
the mother offering the lethal gene,
or vice versa.
Each of which has got probability
one-half times one-half.
The picture on the screen might
make things a little clearer.
In a situation of a carrier,
the male has got both genes.
The female has got both genes.
And there are four possibilities for
the next gene.
In one case, you find that both
parents offer the clean gene.
In one case,
on the left hand of your screen.
Both parents offer the lethal gene.
And there are two
possibilities in the middle,
depending on who offers the lethal
gene and who offers the dominant gene.
All right, and
now this leaves one last case.
The case where the child has the disease.
But this is only possible when
both parents are heterozygous and
each of them proffers the legal gene.
And it's got a probability
one-half times one-half.
Lets pause and take a look at
what we've constructed here.
What is the sample space of this
underlying chance experiment?
All the sample space has
got multiple elements.
There's first the male
genotype in the parent.
Then there's the selection of
the female genotype in the parent.
Then the selection of gene
proffered by the male genotype.
And then the selection of the gene
proffered by the female genotype.
We could abstract all of this
out by saying the following.
There are two tosses
of a bent coin who success probabilities
are in the upper right of your screen.
These will tell you what the selection
of the parental genotypes is.
And then there are two more tosses.
This time of a fair coin which
selects a gene at random from one
of the two genes on each of the genotypes.
So two bent coin tosses and two fair coin
tosses would describe the experiment.
Of course, this is a rather
complicated way to look at it.
We can simplify matters
a little bit now because
we are not looking
really just at settings.
Where we have genotypes for
parents and genotypes for children.
And we can put all of this together and
abstract all this information out very,
very simply.
As far as the genotypes
of the filial generation.
We could reduce this probability
space to three elements.
The two parental genotypes and
the child's genotypes.
In other words, a triple of
genotypes completely describes for
our purposes what this
experiment is about.
In this space, where the sample
points are triples of genotypes.
Events are subsets of the space and
we'll use informal language and
notation to capture these events.
So for example on the left of your screen
you have the four possible
parental genotypes combinations.
Each of these represents
an event of space in the triples.
For example, the two upper case A where
both parents are normal homozygous.
Represents an event where the first
two elements are normal homozygous and
the third,
the child's genotype is something.
Of course,
only one thing is possible in this case.
But if both parents were heterozygous,
then the child's genotype
could be anything.
These constitute the event descriptions.
And the problem structure
allows us to directly include
modulate an assumption
of random selection.
And maintain modular, an assumption
of independence on multiple fronts.
There the probabilities of the event
on the left are given in the table,
as you see, by simply multiplying
all the elements together.
The rest of the story,
in creating the probability measure,
is given to us via
the conditional probabilities.
Which take us from parental
genotypes to the filial genotypes.
And these can be a symbol of one
ratios in another table like this.
The rows of the table tell you
what the pair of genotypes are.
The columns to mean what
the future type are.
And the conditional probabilities
are filled on the side.
Together, these two tables are.
The picture will tell you the entirety
of the probability space.
If we think of the probability
space here as being described
by triples of genotypes.
We can extract the underlying
probability measure.
At need by simply multiplying out
the a priori probabilities and
these conditional probabilities.
Which in the context of these,
of this flow of time,
you'll naturally identify as
transition probabilities.
By simply multiplying them out term wise.
We get the probability
of every atomic triple.
All the atomic probabilities
are now within our purview.
Of course, this requires much more
effort than you really need to put in.
The conditional probabilities
tell us everything we need
about this particular experiment.
We are now equipped to come down and ask
and answer the question we started with.
Which is,
what can one say about the distribution
of genotypes in the theory of generation.
What is u prime?
What is twice v prime?
What is w prime?
Of course, we would like an answer
based upon the original proportions
in the parental population.
We turn to this next.
