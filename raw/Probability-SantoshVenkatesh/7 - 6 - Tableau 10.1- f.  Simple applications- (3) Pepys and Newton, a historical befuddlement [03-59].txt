In our next example,
we'll take a little walk down memory lane.
This is a famous problem which is posed
by Samuel Pepys to Isaac Newton in 1693.
Pepys asked Newton if it is more
probable to obtain at least one ace.
An ace is a 6.
in six throws of a die, or to obtain at
least two aces in 12 throws of a die?
Newton quickly gave Pepys the answer,
and Pepys disbelieved him.
Let us make up our own minds on the score.
Pause the lecture while
you think about it.
See if you can set up the calculation and,
if you get that far, see if you can find
a numerical estimate and answer Pepys.
Start the lecture when you're ready.
Now that you're back, each throw of a die,
from the point of view of getting an ace,
corresponds to the toss
of a metaphorical coin whose
success probability is one in six.
And therefore, as far as getting aces
is concerned, each of a succession
of throws represents a Bernoulli trial
with success probability one in six.
And therefore, in N trials,
the number of sixes obtained in
this interpretation is S sub N and,
of course, it's going to be
governed by a binomial distribution
corresponding to N trials and
whose success probability is one in six.
With this in hand, it becomes transparent
and easy to write down a formulation.
And all that'll be left, all but
the shouting, is a numerical evaluation.
So let's start promptly.
The probability that in six throws
of a die you get at least one ace.
Well, by additivity,
it'll be easy to write in terms of
the compliment that he get no aces.
Is one minus the probability that
he get no aces in six throws?
The probability of getting no aces
in six throws, is our old friend,
the binomial probability, B of zero,
with parameters of N equal to six,
and P equal to one-sixth.
We simply write down the binomial
probability, evaluate it,
and we find it's about 67%, approximately.
It's quite likely,
it's about the chance of
getting at least one 6 in six throws
of a die is about two, two in three.
What about the probability of getting at
least two sixes in 12 throws of a die?
Now N, the numbers of trials is 12,
and P still remains one over six.
So the probability of getting at least
two successes, again by additivity,
the complement of that event is the event
that you get either no successes or
precisely one success.
And therefore probability of
getting at least two successes
is one minus the probability
of getting no successes,
minus the probability
of getting one success.
Of course, these are binomial
probabilities, we just write them down,
evaluate them, and we get simple binomial
expressions which simplify very quickly.
Any very simple calculator
will give this for you.
And we evaluate it, and
we find that the odds are about 62%.
In fact, as Newton found,
and proclaimed to Pepys,
it is somewhat more likely that you
get at least one ace in six throws,
than that you get at least
two aces in twelve throws.
