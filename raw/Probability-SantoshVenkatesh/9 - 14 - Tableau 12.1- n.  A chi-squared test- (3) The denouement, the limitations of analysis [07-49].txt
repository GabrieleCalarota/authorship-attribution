Good.
We now have a very simple test.
And let's promptly go back to our data and
see how the data values fall
with regard to this test.
Driven well we have a confidence interval.
And now we can forget about everything
else except how to compute the chi-squared
and the confidence interval,
which is from 1.69 to 17.01.
And our question now is
where do the data fall in?
To begin, we start for
this confidence interval and
now we compute the chi squared values for
first birds adult IQ data.
Second, that children will like your data.
And third, as a sanity check, for
the random data that I generated on my
computer, for a normal distribution with
these parameters, there is a third bar.
And here is what we find.
The chi-squared value for the parents, for
the adults clocks in at .13 for
the given data.
The chi-squared value for
the children clocks in at 0.2,
both well to the left of
the left quantile 1.69.
This is looking too good to be true.
It's as if somebody cooked the books
to make the numbers fall exactly
where we want them to be.
As a sanity check, take a look at
the data that I actually generated
using a random number
generator on my machine.
This is the third bar.
It looks worse, it looks more aberrant,
more fluctuations.
Its chi-squared value clocks in at 10.07,
smack bang in the middle of
our 95% confidence interval.
The level of fluctuations there is
actually to be, entirely to be expected.
This is what real random
data would look like,
a certain amount of random fluctuation
is inescapable and this is very typical.
But the data for the parents and
the children on the other hand,
look too suspiciously good, do they not?
But wait a minute.
The story isn't quite done.
And the reason is,
this was based upon an assumption
of a nominal sample size of n being 1000.
But, bear in mind that Verte
told us that the three
individuals in the higher professional
category are actually more like 120.
Perhaps there was a scaling factor of 40.
Well what happens if 1,000 is
scaled by a certain scaling factor?
Well I don't know what
the scaling factor is.
Burt's paper doesn't tell us.
So, let's see what we can do if
we pose it as scaling factor.
Let's say the sample
size is 1000 times N for
some reduction from a sample to a mill,
a thousand.
Let's take a look at what happens
in the chi-squared values as
the scaling factor changes.
And if we go back to our sum for the
chi-squared and we put in n is at 1000m,
we find that all that
happens is that the reported
chi-squared values scales by m.
Now, let's take a look at what conclusions
we can draw at a 95% level of confidence.
Whenever n is 1,
then the chi-squared values are so
excessively small,
the data are just too good to believe.
We reject the data,
with contumely on grounds
that it is just too suspiciously regular.
Fraud.
What if, on the other hand, the data
were actually scaled by a factor of 40?
In other words, m is 40.
In this case,
40 times .13 and
40 times .2 land us very nicely
in the middle of the confidence
interval from 1.69 to 17.01.
In this case,
the chi-squared values we get there
are exactly what we might anticipate
from just random fluctuations in data.
Life happens,
we don't always get perfection.
In fact,
we rarely get perfection in random data.
And what if, a scaling factor,
this is not in Burt's paper, but
what if there was actually scaling for
between 10 and 20?
That lands us near the periphery
of the confidence intervals for
both parents and children.
In this case, we reserve judgement.
Statistics can only do so much.
Now, the point of this
exercise was to show you,
how, in an unexpected way,
Central Limit Theorem arguments
could lead to fairly sophisticated
analyses of real life situations.
But real life is murky, okay?
We cannot at this stage look
definitively at the paper.
There's no other data available
from that time of birth.
He is long gone.
The people he surveyed
presumably are also long gone.
There's no way of testing that data.
The listener might want to think
about the difficulties, perhaps if
we would accept the suggestion that the
data size were actually more like 40,000.
The difficulties of conducting
40,000 IQ tests for
adults and 40,000 IQ tests for children,
even over a period of 50 years.
And, even a very crude calculation would
suggest that one will have to do something
like three or four or
five tests every day for 50 years.
And, you might want to ruminate on
the difficulty of doing something like
that on that scale.
Okay.
But then perhaps you might say,
well maybe you had help.
But of course,
these questions are all imponderable.
And the attackers of that and
his fervent defenders had
different points of view on this.
And to this day,
the controversy still rages.
All right?
With points of view on one side or
the other.
The point of our excursus was not to
come to a definitive conclusion on whether
Burt was more sinned against than sinning,
whether he was really a great
man who was unfairly maligned,
calumny, or whether he was
actually a lonely, impotent man
who committed fraud in a desperate
attempt to keep on to academic glory.
Now such questions are far
beyond a per view and
a statistical test cannot begin
to eliminate these issues.
But nonetheless, a principled
test can provide a way forward,
can shed some light on what is
an otherwise a very murky business.
Right.
We don't need to just rely on faith.
We can do some analysis.
But, we should keep firmly in mind
the limitations of such analyses.
To quote from T.W.
Connor one more time, right.
He urges us to keep in mind
that battalions of numbers,
like battalions of men are not
always as strong as supposed.
