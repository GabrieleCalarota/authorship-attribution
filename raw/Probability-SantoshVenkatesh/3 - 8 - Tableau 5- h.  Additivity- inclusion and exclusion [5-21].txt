Rules in equality gives us a bound for
a probability of a union.
But of course it is,
it would be nice, if at all possible,
to get an explicit formula.
An equality if you will.
So let's consider two events A and
B again and.
There are two generic events with no
a priori relationship between them,
in terms of inclusion of one and
the other.
We'd like to find a formulation which
describes the probability of A union B.
Our approach is going to be, to try to
decompose events into simpler objects.
And then leverage additivity again and
again, right?
So, here are three uses of additivity.
Let's start with the event A.
And let's decompose A into two pieces.
A minus B and A intersection B.
Additivity tells us the probability of
A is a sum of the two probabilities
of A minus B and A to section B.
Rearrange terms, move the probability
of A minus B to the left,
move the probability of A to the right and
you've got an identity.
For the probability of A minus B,
in terms of the probability of A and
the probability of A to section B.
We can do the same thing for
the event B, decompose it as B minus A,
union with A to section B.
The probability of B the sum of the two
probabilities to rearrange terms, and
you've got an analogous identity.
For the probability of B minus A,
as the probability of B minus
the probability of A to section B.
How about A union B.
Well, we can break it up
into three pieces now.
The segment A minus B,
the segment B minus A,
and the segment in the middle,
A to section B.
And so, A union B is the union
of three disjoint pieces.
Additivity says the probability of A union
B is the sum of the three probabilities.
On the right, we've got the probability of
A minus B, the probability of B minus A,
two set difference probabilities.
Together with the probability
of A intersection B,
the probability of a conjunction.
Each of those set difference probabilities
can be replaced by the identities
we have just discovered.
If you do this, and reassemble terms,
you'll find we have the probability of A,
the probability of B, you have
two occurrences of the probability of
A to intersection B with a minor sign and
one occurrence of the pray, probability of
A to intersection B with a positive sign.
Reassemble everything and
now we've got an explicit identity.
The probability of A union B
is equal to the probability of
A plus the probability of B minus
the probability of A intersection B.
The listener may well be forgiven for
being singularly unimpressed.
So what, so we did some manipulation and
out came a formula.
Is it useful?
As it turns out yes, indeed.
This kind of decomposition
has subtle uses.
At a higher level what you
observe is on the left,
you've got the probability of
a disjunction, of a union.
On the right you have got
raw image probabilities.
And probabilities of conjunctions.
Decompositions like this
are useful in problem settings
where conjunction probabilities
are easier to compute.
We will see illustrations of
this kind of idea when we
introduce the idea the central notion.
Of independence.
But for the time being,
we've got an identity, which comes
out just by churning additivity.
We call this identity visually,
graphically, the inclusion
exclusion identity.
In other ways,
if you're looking at A union B.
You get to the probability of the union
by first adding the raw probabilities of
A and B, finding we've over-counted, and
subtracting the intersection probability.
We've included and then we've excluded
just enough to get an identity.
We can build on this further and
develop other identities.
The next segment is a dangerous bend
segment which you could skip over at will,
if you wish.
But shows you how we can
take something like this and
effortlessly churn out more additivities.
Before we launch into that, the reader
should pause and do a sanity check.
When one is given a formula like this,
it is always wise to look at it
from different perspectives.
See if it makes sense.
Does it illuminate
something you already know?
So for example you could ask what if A and
B have particular relationships?
What for instance if A is a subset of B?
What do you get?
What if one of these sets
is empty of everything?
What if A and B are disjoint?
Play with these.
See what you get.
And when you're ready, proceed.
