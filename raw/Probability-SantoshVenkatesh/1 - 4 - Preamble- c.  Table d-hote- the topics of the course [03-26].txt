A brief survey of the menu of items
that you will encounter in this course.
Let me employ a culinary metaphor.
The chefs are your teaching assistants and
your instructors.
And we now have a repast,
arriving before us.
A here is the menu that we're going to
say, the topics of the class.
This is a fixed menu and we don't have
the opportunity here to, to cut and
change the elements.
But there is a certain amount
of flexibility as you will see.
The course is arranged in
five topical segments,
starting from the development of an
axiomatic theory, moving all the way up to
the emergence of the fabulous limit
laws and the remarkable bell curve.
These topical arrangements
are spread over eight weeks.
Two weeks a piece for the first three
topics and one week a piece for
the last two.
And each topic is arranged in a series
of lectures that I will call Tableaux.
So, tableaux is a coherent,
intellectually self-contained collection
of ideas, a lecture, if you will.
Some tableaux need more than one part.
So, you have parts one and two, or
sometimes parts one, two, and three.
And, together these tableaux
will make up a topic.
The tableaux I'm going to present for
you are of three types.
And to carry this culinary
metaphor further forward,
these tableaux are of the type of
hors d'oeuvre, little appetizers.
These include the preview lecture which
have being made available currently,
as well as the review lectures.
On the elements of counting and
naive set theory.
And then a main body of tableaux,
which comprises the meat of the course.
These are the elements which flesh
out the topics from one through five.
And as we progress through these tableaux,
you will discover that some elements, some
segments of a tableaux, and sometimes the
entire tableaux are marked with this sign.
This sigil stands for a dangerous bend,
an exploration of an idea or of a topic,
which constitutes a, let's say a tributary
from the main river of probability.
These tributaries are fragrant,
exotic, sometimes dangerous.
Sample them as time and inclination allow.
These are bonus lectures.
You can absorb them while
progressing through linearly,
the material in the class.
Or you could come back to them
at a later time when repeat,
by a chance of occurrence.
This then is a setting for the class.

tableaux, these topics are fleshed out and
