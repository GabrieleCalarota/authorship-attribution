Let us take stock.
We are interested in
computing the probability
of a success run of length 5 on or
before the n'th trial, s n.
We manage to reduce that to
a question about the probabilities of
first success runs.
F1, f2, 3, f3 through fn.
And we managed to fall that off to
a question about computing the probability
of any success run.
Terminating at a given point, say n.
If it can compute un, for any end,
then it can compute the f's.
This looks even harder.
But an appeal to additivity
just one more time.
Third time pays for all.
We'll settle it for us.
And at the heart of this
excursor's additivity
is a key appeal once more to the fact that
we're dealing with independent trials.
Let's take a close look at
what happens if we have
successes in the five trials
terminating at trial n.
If we have successes at trials n minus 4,
n minus 3, n minus 2, n minus 1, and n.
If you have five successes.
Consecutive successes.
Then, it must be the case that
in one of those five locations,
there must be a success
run which is terminated.
Eh, a picture is worth
a thousand words here.
So let's draw the possibilities.
Imagine a setting where,
from trials in minus 4 through n, we have
a string of five consecutive successes
five once, and let's focus on that.
Now, if this is the case, then the first
row of the picture shows you one
possibility, that yes, you have five
successes there and it transpires
that a success run of length five
terminates at the nth trial.
How could this happen?
Well, you could have a failure
at trial in minus 5.
If that happen then you have
a success run terminating at trial n.
Or this could be a string of
two consecutive access runs.
So you have one success run
terminating at n minus 5.
And another success run immediately
after it terminating at n.
Or it could be a string of three
consecutive success runs terminating at n.
All these cases are folded into
the first row on your table.
And the probability of that.
By fiat, by convention,
is what we call use of n.
The probability that there
is a success run first or
subsequent, terminating at trial n.
Here's one way in which you
could get five ones in a row,
from trial n minus 4 to trial n.
Another possibility is that a success
run terminated at trial n minus 1.
Meaning that you must have successes from
n minus 5 through n minus 1 followed
by one more success which may or may not
be the start of one more success run.
Here's another way of
getting five ones in a row.
To get a success run which
terminates at trial n minus 1,
it must be the case that either there
was a failure at trial n minus 6
immediately preceding it, or it was one
of two consecutive success runs, or
one of three consecutive success runs and
so on.
All these possibilities
are captured in our notation.
In u n minus 1.
And so we have a success run
terminating at trial n minus 1,
probability is u n minus 1.
And, is success to follow,
shown in maroon?
And that gives you a probability one half.
Independent trials means these
two probabilities must multiply.
The next possibility in the third row in
the table says that now we have a success
run terminating a trial, n minus 2,
followed by two successes,
which may or may not be the start of yet
another success run.
And then another possibility where you
have a success run terminating at trial
n minus 3, and finally,
a success run terminating at n minus 4.
And a little introspection convinces us
that if we have five ones in a row from
trials n minus 4, through, to trial n,
then one of these five
possibilities must transpire.
There must be a success run terminating
somewhere in the the of five.
And now,
additivity puts everything together.
The probability of five ones in a row
from trials n minus 4 through trial n
is one half times one half times one
half times one half or 2 to the minus 5.
This is because the trials are repeated
and independent, and the coin is fair.
And now we stitch together
the possibilities.
The first row has got probability u n.
A success run terminated at trial n, in
which case you do get five ones in a row.
Or a success run terminates at trial n
minus 1, probability u n minus 1, and
you have one more success,
which is u n minus 1, times one half.
Or a success run terminates at trial n
minus 2, probability is u n minus 2,
and then you have two
successive successes.
And the probability of that
is 2 to the power minus 2.
And we systematically
stitch the pieces together.
And these five pieces added
together must give you
the probability of the event
that you had five ones in a row.
Now this is lovely.
I should mention that up to this
point a development had been generic.
We could have replaced coin
tosses by other experiments
where there were renewals.
And, arguments would have
been essentially the same.
But this is the first place where
the essential nature of the coin toss and
the fact that they're looking at sequences
of successes, runs, comes into play.
Right?
So here's where we're using
problem specific information,
as opposed to more generic analysis.
At the end of the day I've got
an equation which has taken up
a certain amount of real estate.
It looks a little complex.
What do we learn from it?
Let's keep our eyes
firmly on the prize here.
What's the key thing we want to look at?
We want to say something about un, the
probability that there is a success run,
first or subsequent.
At trial n.
Isolate u n on the right hand side and
move everything to the other side.
And now we've got a new expression,
u n in terms of other things.
But a, a little look at the right hand
side tells us that we are primed for
yet one more slogan.
If I know the first n minus 1 values,
u1 through un minus 1,
then I've got a pathway to
deducing the nth value, un.
Now, this is very pretty because this
says if I know u1, I can construct u2.
If I know u1 and u2, I can construct u3.
If I know u1, u2, u3,
I can construct u4 and so on down.
Here's a recursive pathway to
computing the probabilities u n.
Now everything is in place.
Now let's assemble and
put everything together.
