The apparently serendipitous,
accidental discovery of the bell
curve by the de Moivre in 1733 was to
have deep and portentous consequences.
As is the case of, of anywhere typically
in mathematics and in science,
great and abiding pathways arise
from very small beginnings.
After de Moivre's initial
discovery in 1733,
it took 80 years before
the next development.
Before Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace
extended de Moivre's analysis for
a fair coin to bent coins.
And from the early part of
the 19th century onwards,
the developments proceeded apace, and
gathering speed as the century moved on.
By the end of the 19th century and
by the early part of the 20th century,
it had become apparent that that
apparently accidental discovery of
de Moivre was really fundamental.
That the bell curve arose everywhere,
and it was not an accident.
This led, ultimately, to that basic
principle and probability perhaps,
the preeminent principle and probability,
that is called the central limit theorem.
Let me give you a version of
the theorem and unapologetically,
without any proofs at this point.
A version that is very comprehensive and
already takes into account
a large application domain.
So, to begin, we're going to start
with a random sample, as always.
It's an honest sample.
We're thinking of repeated
independent trials.
There's an underlying distribution,
which spits out numbers.
And we're going to draw independently
from that distribution.
X is a generic example of
an outcome of this experiment.
And we perform independent copies of X,
X1, X2, X3 Xn, and so forth.
A setting of repeated independent trials.
Suppose additionally that
the underlying distribution, or
chance law, has an expectation,
a probabilistic center of mass, mu.
And a variance,
an expected squared deviation
from the center of sigma squared.
Starting with this, we promptly
form a sequence of partial sums.
Sn as always now,
is a sum of the first n Xs.
Now we want to look at this as n
becomes larger and larger and larger.
We're going to look at
the sequence of partial sums Sn.
And you should draw freely from
your experience with the binomial.
Now the distribution of
Sn can be quite complex.
It's inherited from the underlying
distribution of the xs, but in general,
it's going to have a really complex form.
There is no hope, in general,
to find a closed form solution for
what the chance law of Sn
is going to look like.
But, if we look at it asymptotically,
as n becomes large,
well then, we should look at it with
a proper centering and a proper scale.
Our experience again with the binomial
tells us that we should standardize.
And for every n, form a new variable, Sn*,
properly centered at zero expectation
by subtracting from Sn, n times mu.
Remember, additivity
rides to the fore here.
That centers the distribution
at the origin, and then putting
in place a common scale by dividing by the
spread of the standard deviation of Sn.
Additivity, again, tells us that
variance of Sn is n times sigma squared.
So the standard deviation is
the square root of n times sigma.
We now have a standardized variable,
properly centered at the origin,
and viewed at a proper scale.
We're now looking at, if you like,
a dimensionless variable.
In the context of the binomial,
we realize that this Sn* was governed
essentially by a normal distribution,
essentially by the bell curve.
And remarkably,
almost four centuries after de Moivre,
we find that this is true quite generally.
The probability that a,
a properly centered variable,
a sum variable,
viewed in the proper scale,
lies between any given range you choose,
but you can say an a and a b.
Is given approximately by the area
under the bell curve between a to b.
No matter what the underlying
distribution or chance law was.
This is remarkable.
This explains why the bell curve is so
ubiquitous, in theory and in application.
Sums are endemic in science, in
engineering, in mathematics, in sociology.
And because sums are so prevalent,
if we have reason to believe
that the perturbations making
up the summands are independent,
then we should expect that
a suitably centered and
scaled version of a sum will
behave like a normal law.
This is remarkable.
This theorem is perhaps
the central theorem,
the most important and
fundamental theorem in all of chance.
And we can only get a glimmer of why it
is so portentous, why it is so weighty.
It applies in all kinds of circumstances,
regardless of the underlying
starting distribution.
This theorem has the role
of an eminence grise.
The grey eminence a side reference
to the Cardinal Richelieu.
It informs, essentially,
the entire theory.
And it's because of this remarkable fact
that the bell curve crops up again and
again and again.
Essentially, what were
the underlying chance laws?
Now, as the 20th century progressed,
this result was strengthened and
further generalized,
and it continues to be generalized
today into varieties of circumstances.
Settings where the variables are drawn
from, say, different chance laws, but
are still independent.
Settings where the variables have
values in more than one dimension.
In other words,
we're adding random vectors.
Settings where the variables
are not independent, but almost so.
Settings where there's only a weak
dependency across the variables.
The bell curve keeps cropping up again and
again and again.
An understanding of these
circumstances then leads to
other limit laws, where, for example,
the variables have dependencies, or
perhaps the variables don't have variance.
Or some, perhaps, where the variables
don't even have expectation.
This accidental discovery
of de Moivre from 1733 had
fruits far beyond what could've been ec,
anticipated at that time.
This has informed, essentially,
all of modern probability, and
as we shall see, has informed
application domains in a huge spread,
a huge of palette of possibilities.
Of course, the further we go
along with these results,
the more we try to tweak out of this,
the more it is clear that we're going
to need mathematical dexterity.
And so, yes,
the later reaches of this kind of result
are prodigiously difficult sometimes.
They require a lot of
mathematical background.
But at the end of it all, the result
itself is startling in its simplicity.
And perhaps again, because we are dealing
with a political age, a slogan
to summarize the essential features of
this mathematical result is appropriate.
The sum of independent
perturbations follows a normal law.
