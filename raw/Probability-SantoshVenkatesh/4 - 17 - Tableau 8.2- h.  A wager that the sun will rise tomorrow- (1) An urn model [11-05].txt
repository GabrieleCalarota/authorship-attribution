Applications of the theorem
of total probability rely
upon our finding a proper
partition of a sample space.
Let me start with a historical example
which is of some modern significance.
What are the chances that
the sun will rise tomorrow?
Now, well this is a perplexing question.
There doesn't seem to be much room for
chance in this particular game.
The problem, or this particular question,
was posed by Pierre-Simon,
Marquis de Laplace, today,
we know, know him as Laplace,
the foremost mathematical physicist
of the early 19th century,
in his epochal volume,
The Analytical Theory of Probability.
In this book he posited
the following odds.
Laplace was willing to wager
about 1.8 million to 1 that
the sun would rise tomorrow.
And his argument went
along the following lines.
He said well, it is manifest that
the sun has risen without a break for
5,000 years in a row, or
perhaps more precisely by his
count, 1,826,213 days in
a row without a break.
And based upon this number,
1.8 million days of continuous risings
of the sun, he was willing to offer
odds of about 1.8 million to one that
the sun would indeed rise tomorrow.
A student might well be forgiven for
being a little perplexed.
What is an underlying
model of randomness here?
It's not so clear at all, but
there are some clues in the way
Laplace has phrased his argument.
Apparently, Laplace placed significant
weight in the fact that there were
a succession of a long number of
continuous risings of the sun,
and this plays into the chance
of this event occurring again.
Let us detour to set up
a different kind of problem
where this phenomenon is in evidence.
So, as a non-sequitur, a,
a break from a direct line,
let us go back to the ball and urn model.
Consider as I have shown in the picture,
a system of 11 urns each
containing 10 balls.
Let us say we number the urns zero,
one, two, three up to ten.
The balls in each urn are of two types,
red and black.
The urn on the left consists of
all the balls which are black.
The urn on the right
consists of ten red balls.
And generally, say the Kth urn in
the middle contains K red balls and
10 minus K black balls.
Here's a setting.
Now, let's quickly abstract this, and
instead of restricting ourselves to ten
balls, think of a large number,
say N, of balls and N plus 1 urns.
So we are given n plus 1
urns labeled zero through N.
Each urn contains N balls.
The Kth urn contains k red balls and
N minus k black balls.
The chance experiment proceeds as follows.
One of these urns is selected at random.
Having picked an urn, we set it aside and
repeatedly sample balls from it
randomly and with replacement.
Our question.
Suppose we're not told which urn
was selected but we are told,
this is side information,
that r successive
draws resulted in r red balls in a row.
What is a chance that the r plus 1th draw
from that selected urn
will result in a red ball?
The tenuous connections to
the Laplacian problem are clear.
There's a repeated occurrence of an event.
And we now ask how does this
condition a future occurrence?
But in this setting a chance
experiment is easy to construct and
the underlying sample
space is easy to identify.
So without further ado
what is a sample space?
Well, all the elements that are uncertain
in the experiment can be
categorized as follows.
First, there's a selection of an urn.
Next, there's a repeated selection
of a ball with replacement
from that urn, each ball characterized
by its color, red or black.
Since we are considering a selection of
an urn and r plus 1 selections of balls,
we could think of the sample space
as a string, a sequence of letters.
A specification of an urn,
say x, taking values from 0, 1,
through N, followed by
a specification of ball colors, y1,
y2, y3, through y sub r plus 1,
where each value y takes one
of two colors, red or black.
Now we have a,
an understanding of what constitutes a,
an idealized outcome of
this chance experiment.
What are the events of interest?
Well, let's begin.
Naturally, one event of
interest is the event that r
draws from the selected urn
result in r successive red balls.
A second event of interest is
that r plus 1 successive draws
from that selected urn result
in r plus 1 red balls.
Let's introduce some notation, all right?
Let h sub k denote the event
that the first k draws
from the selected add result in red balls.
Formally this is a collection
of sequences x, y1,
y2 though yr plus 1,
where y1 through yk are red and
other variables are free to
move willy-nilly as you will.
Of course, the particular values of k of
interest to us are k is equal to r and
k is equal to r plus 1.
Now this by itself is
a complex looking problem.
There are too many moving pieces here.
We naturally look about for
a way to partition it, break it up
into simple, homogeneous segments.
And a natural partition is
immediately suggested by annotation,
by the first element in the sample point,
the selection of the urn.
So let's introduce some
ancillary notation.
Let a0, a1, a2 through a sub n, represent,
sequentially, the events that
the zeroth urn was selected,
the first urn was selected,
and the nth urn was selected.
Generically, let A sub j denote
the event that the jth urn was selected.
J runs from zero through n.
Naturally enough,
we are going to condition on these
events A sub j as ancillary events.
Observe that since some
urn has to be selected,
the events A0, A1,
through An partition the sample space.
All sample points have to be in one or
the other of these events.
And it's manifestly clear that
these events are disjoint,
they are mutually exclusive.
If one chooses,
say the third urn, then one manifestly
has not selected, say, the seventh urn.
We are now left with the task of
specifying a probability measure.
And in such settings it is
most natural to specify
the measure implicitly via
conditional probabilities.
Let us start with
the ancillary event a sub j.
In the Laplacian model,
there is no reason to believe that any
one urn is more likely to
be selected than any other.
And therefore, we assign to each of
these events, A0, A1 through An,
equal probability, 1 over N plus 1.
Having selected an urn,
what can we say about the events 8 sub k,
that k successive draws
resulted in red balls.
Now if the jth urn was selected,
then we recall that
the jth urn contains j red balls and
N minus j black balls.
Each draw of a red ball
has got j possibilities.
K successive draws,
the number of possibilities,
in total, is N to the power k, and
the number of ways of which these N to the
k can result in red balls is j to the k.
Remember, the urn contains j red balls.
And therefore, if you're looking at
a string of k draws, we have j, j,
j, k times and
by the usual principle of enumeration,
there are j to the power k ways of
selecting k red balls from this urn.
Now, the probability,
therefore, that given that
the jth urn has been selected, that k
red balls in succession have been drawn,
is j to the power k divided
by N to the power k.
There's a beautiful and
simple prescription of
an implicit probability measure.
Just as we did in the case of two dice,
we can now go back and
figure out the mass function attached
to each particular idealized outcome.
But that'll take us a little far afield,
and it is not necessary for our purposes.
