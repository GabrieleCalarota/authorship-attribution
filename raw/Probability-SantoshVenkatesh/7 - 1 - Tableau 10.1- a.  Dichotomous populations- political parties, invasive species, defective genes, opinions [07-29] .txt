Tableau 10, From polls to bombs.
Part 1: enter the binomial distribution.
The Tableau will be in two parts.
Part 1, we'll introduce
the august binomial distribution.
The first of the three fundamental
distributions in the theory of chance.
And as we shall see,
it arises naturally through
the consideration of polling processes.
The second part will deal with
the emergence of the whimsical mysterious
Poisson distribution and
that will be the context of rare events.
And as we shall see a noteworthy example,
remarkable example arises when you
look the distribution of bomb hits.
So this is our setting for the current
tableau and without further adieu
lets start by discussing the setting from
which the binomial distribution arises.
Let me start with a political setting
that is familiar to many people.
In many countries we have, let's say,
two dominant parties, political parties.
And here is a montage showing,
for example, how political
persuasions changed across
United States over a century or so.
The two dominant political parties in the
US at this time are the Republicans and
the Democrats.
And as you see across the montage
of images, the density
of Republican and Democrat concentration
has change quite dramatically in time.
This is familiar to individuals
in many political settings.
And so
let me abstract out what is key here.
We're thinking about two political parties
in a country and at a large level,
what we have seen now is that the,
at least the voting populace of a country,
are split into two
primary sub-populations.
In the United States, the Democrats and
the Republicans, but, and
of course in other countries,
you can replace them by two other large
political parties of your choice.
There are examples of settings where
we have dichotomous populations or
principally dichotomous populations.
Here's another example,
this time from environmental science.
A consequence of humans travelling
faster and quicker around
the world is that they carry indigenous
species with them to far off locales.
This can have undesirable and
sometimes very deleterious
consequences to the local environment.
Spectacular instances of this arise,
for example, in the Florida Everglades
where the creature at the top of
the pyramid is the Florida alligator.
But over the last century, a,
an interloper arrived, the Burmese python.
Now, of course the Burmese python
is not native to these parts.
It is brought in from Asia
perhaps released into the wild when
it became inconveniently large and
found that the environment was very
conducive to spreading and so it did.
And now we have two large creatures
sitting at the top of the pyramid.
And that's causing changes to
the entire perimeter structure
of existence within
the Florida Everglades.
There are many other examples.
For instance, in the African Great Lakes
of Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika,
the native fish are the cichlids
are languid high
biodiversity rather placid as a species.
In the middle of the 20th century an
aggressive interloper was introduced for
sports fishing purposes.
This is the Nile perch.
And of course, in retrospect,
it is clear what would happen,
the Nile perch started taking over.
It's taking out large
domains in these waters.
To of course the detriment of the sickles.
What is the proportion of
the Nile perch sickles today?
We know it is an issue, but how does
one figure out how big an issue it is?
Til another example of a dichotomous
population arises in industrial
quality control.
Whether it is of computer chips,
cars, wrenches, or what have you.
An organization, when they produce
a product, want to make sure the product
is of high quality, because recalls
are expensive and lead to bad publicity.
And therefore the quality control
process tries to identify
objects that are not up to snuff,
objects that are defective.
If the manufacturing process creates
too many defective entities,
then the organization suffers.
What proportion of
the production is defective?
Still yet another example of a di,
a dichotomous population.
We've already seen examples of
recessive and lethal genes.
Different genetic variations,
let's say there are two of them,
cause a dichotomous population
falling into one or the other camp.
What proportion of the population, say,
has got a recessive and lethal gene?
Say, that of sickle cell anemia.
One more example to set the stage.
And of course this is very familiar
to all of us, if we open a newspaper,
listen to the news, watch a blog,
read a blog, opinion posts.
What opinions do people have positive or
negative on a variety of topics, for
example it could be highly controversial.
Universal health care on one hand,
resilient individual choice on the other.
Intervention into a troubled
part of the world, or not.
And so on, and so forth.
In all these instances,
we have an example of an underlying
population, possibly very large number and
that population consists
primarily of two pieces.
It is a dichotomous population.
Of course we understand that in the real
world we can have more than two
sub-populations.
But of course as George Polya
would recommend for
us, when we start looking at
a complex problem, it is wise to
start by looking at the simplest version
of the problem we don't understand.
In any case, in all the examples I've
listed for you on the screen, all of
these are instance where populations
are largely, or primarily, dichotomous.
And in such settings, the basic,
the fundamental question that arises for
us is the following.
How can we estimate the make
up of the sub-population mix
of the underlying population?
