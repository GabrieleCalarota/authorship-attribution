Our model at this level has led
us to the following conclusion.
Starting with the coin facing upwards,
tossed with a translational speed v and
an angular velocity omega,
it is caught at some termination time tau,
when the coin returns to
its starting position,
with some angle theta of tau,
that it makes with the horizontal.
A student will recall from her
high school physics classes that
the motion of such an object is completely
described by Newton's laws of motion.
If the listener has not seen these before,
she might perhaps be willing
to take these on faith.
These are going to be
very simple equations
which completely characterize
the motion of this coin.
If for no other reason than to
see how the story turns out.
But in any case,
let's begin by considering
the height the coin is at time t.
Now the coin, starting at height 0,
is subjected solely
to a gravitational force pulling it down
back towards the surface of the earth.
There's an initial velocity v pointing
straight upwards impartial to the coin,
and the student might remember
the following famous formula.
The height the coin will be at
time t is given by the equation
vt minus one half of gt squared.
The quantity g, of course, a student will
recall, represents standard gravity.
The standard acceleration in free
fall at the surface of the Earth.
The standard value for g is appro,
approximately 9.8 meters
per second squared.
In any case now here is
a completely simple algebraic
representation of the height of
the coin at any given time t.
We should very quickly check to
see whether the initial conditions
are satisfied while at time 0 on
the right hand side I get o and
therefore the height of the coin
at time 0 is as prescribed, 0.
Well, what about the height of
the coin when it actually returns
to its starting point?
Well, this, we recall,
is the termination time, tau.
Plugging in t equal to
tau into our equation,
we see that the height at time tau,
y of tau,
is given by v times tau minus
one-half of g tau squared.
But we are considering terminating
the experiment at the same
height at which we launched the coin.
And therefore,
y of tau is compelled to be 0.
But this gives us now a very simple
equation that we can solve for
the parameter tau.
Tau, the termination time,
is now completely determined
by the initial velocity v and
the gravitational acceleration.
Tau is exactly twice v over g.
So if I know ahead of time what
the velocity is going to be,
I can tell you when
the experiment will be terminated.
The coin will return at time 2v over g.
Now what about the angle it makes?
Well recall that the angle
of velocity is constant.
At some omega, it's spinning around
the horizontal at a certain speed.
Now, when you have a constant spin
then the angle that is covered
is proportional to time, and
therefore the angle theta of t at time
t that the coin makes is
exactly omega times t.
A quick sanity check at time zero.
It's initial angle is
in fact exactly zero.
But now, here we come to the rub.
At time tau,
when the coin returns to the hand,
the angle it makes, theta of tau,
is, of course, omega tau.
But we know what tau is.
It's 2v over g.
And therefore,
we come to the conclusion that the angle
that the coin makes with the horizontal,
at the moment that it is captured,
is 2 omega v over g.
A beautiful, elegant equation.
Glorious in its simplicity, and
in this simple equation it carries a tale.
