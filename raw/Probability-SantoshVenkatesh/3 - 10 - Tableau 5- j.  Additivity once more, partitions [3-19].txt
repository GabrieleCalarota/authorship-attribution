One last example pays for all.
Additivity once more.
So let's begin with a setting,
an abstract setting.
Of course, we have a sample space, omega.
Define a partition of omega to be
any finite collection of events.
Say, A1, A2, A3 through a finite,
all countably infinite collection.
Right.
And
we will denote it in notation by simply
a set of events, A with a subscript j or
a j, for example,
runs through the natural numbers.
Either a finite range or
all the natural numbers.
This is called a partition of omega.
If the events Aj are mutually disjoint,
the intersection of any
two of them is empty.
And the events are so
constituted that together,
they make up the entire sample space.
Right?
In other words, the union of all these Ajs
is omega and this is sort of
visually indicated in the cuts,
the partitions I've showed you
on the right in your figure.
The moment we have this,
additivity immediately gives
rise to the following identity.
Right.
This is the axiom of additivity for
probability measure and we're going to
apply it to the union of all these ajs.
By normalization, the sample space
has got unit probability, but
the sample space may be decomposed
into a disjoint union of a finite or
countably infinite collection of events.
And so by additivity,
this must be equal to the sum of
the probabilities of these events.
And so here is a conclusion.
If one has a partition of
the sample space, then the sum of
the probabilities of the members
of the partition must be one.
This is a powerful,
general idea in principle.
Again, this is additivity to the four.
But this principle at its heart,
its great utility, rests on the idea,
this philosophical idea that we can take
a complex problem and break it up into
pieces, which have got individual
characters, which you can then analyze.
And then again, just stitch everything
together by adding up all the pieces.
Very powerfu, general principle.
A particular manifestation of this
is something we've already seen and
turns out to be quite remarkably useful.
Consider a very special case,
where we partition omega into two pieces.
A set A and what remains?
Well, of course, the complement of A.
Clearly, the sets A and
A complement are a partition of omega.
A and A complement, share no elements.
They are disjoint and
the union is all of omega.
Our additivity principle immediately
tells us then, that the some of
the probabilities of A and the complement
of A must indeed perforce be unit.
We use this repeatedly in
our elementary examples.
And I can't emphasize enough how useful
and important this observation is.
