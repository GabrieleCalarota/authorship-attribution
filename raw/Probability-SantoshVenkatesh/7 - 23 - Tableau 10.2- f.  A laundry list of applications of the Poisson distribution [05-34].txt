Now the listener is, could well
be pardoned for saying all right,
this is all well and good.
So you give a negative approximation,
so what?
Is there any consequence to this?
It's a bit esoteric.
Is it actually useful?
And indeed it is.
And here's where the utility
of Poisson's approximation
suddenly started becoming apparent.
It took a long time.
Poisson himself didn't,
thought it was a curiosity.
He dispensed with it in one page in his,
in his book.
And he really didn't do much with it.
It took about 70 years after that for
the first applications to start arriving.
And today, I've given you a laundry
list of possibilities ranging from
the trivially absurd to the very rich and
deep and portentous.
For example, if you have a collection
of people, what are the chances,
what is the probability that, say,
three of them are born on New Year's Day?
Well, we can think about being born on New
Year's Day as tossing a coin whose success
probability is one in 365.
Each individual tosses their
coin to get their birthday and
now we are asking what is
the probability of three successes?
And if, let's say, we have
an assemblage of 500 or 1,000 people,
it is quite large,
p is 1 over 365, it's very small.
We are now in fertile ground for
a Poisson approximation.
Or perhaps slightly more
frivolously say one has a birthday.
And one's loved ones
makes a birthday cake and
because you're fond of raisins
they put in some raisins.
But sadly they didn't put enough,
enough raisins.
Suppose you cut the cake
into very many thin wedges.
What are the chances that the wedge
you get contains a raisin?
Think of a raisin falling into a wedge as
a rare event if there are few raisins and
many wedges.
Again we have a promising ground for
a Poisson approximation to a binomial.
Misprints in a book.
On a given page there
are a large number of words, and
a word may occasionally be misspelled.
There would,
could be a typographical error.
If the publisher is reputable and
the quality of the book is good one does
not expect very many errors in the book.
If that is the case then each word
is an error but a small chance,
there are relatively few
errors in the whole book.
The chance of a word being
in error is a rare event.
We have a lot of words in the page and
again we have fertile ground for
a Poisson approximation.
On a slightly more serious level,
manufacturing defects.
Clearly a manufacturer can not
tolerate a large number of defects,
otherwise customers will
flock away from him.
So presumably,
defects constitute rare effects.
What are the distribution
of these rare effects?
Of course, defects in critical places
could have very serious effects.
So to analyze this we need to
proper probabilistic model, and
again, a Poisson approximation
gives us a good starting point.
A key discovery of
the late 19th century and
the early 20th century was the discover,
discovery of radioactive decay.
What governs the behavior
of elementary particles?
And in, for example, a position
where a radioactive element decays,
giving up alpha and beta particles,
what is the distribution of the number
of particles that is observed?
And again, we are in the province of
rare events if you're thinking of
low levels of radioactivity.
Similarly, looking at the number
of photons emitted by a photon gun
in a low light environment.
And again, we are as province.
Accidents.
What can one say about the frequency of
accidents on a given stretch of highway?
Again, presumably, accidents are rare.
We are dealing with rare events and
we have a Poisson approximation.
Queues and arrival processes.
What governs arrivals of
individuals to a queue for
a movie which is highly anticipated?
To the opening of a new bookstore?
I understand bookstores
are quaint these days,
but in one,
at one time people did go to bookstores.
Arrivals of packets to an internet server.
Now again we're thinking
of a setting where
the events might not be rare anymore, but
they seem to capture the flavor of what
happens in a Poisson approximation.
This turns out to have very rich and deep
consequences in the theory of queues and
transportation, in telecommunication.
And in astrophysics, in the distribution
of stars and, and the cosmos.
Again, think of the formation
of a star as a rare event
in the vast immensity of space.
So, Poisson's observation, his
curious approximation turned out to
have unexpected rich, rich consequences.
We'll now spend some time looking at some
of these applications in greater depth
to see how well this kind of
modeling fits the reality.
