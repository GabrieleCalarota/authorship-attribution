Summary of Tableau 11,
The fabulous limit laws, Part 3.
The bell curve fits in,
why polls really work.
At the heart of our short lecture today,
was the discovery
of the central limit theorem and
the ubiquitous nature of the bell curve.
The sum of independent
motivations behaves,
essentially, as if it were
governed by a normal law.
Suitably scented and skilled,
the probability of a sum,
line between in any interval,
say, between a and b,
is given approximately by the area
under the bell curve in that interval.
This remarkable theorem has informed
a host of applications all fueled
by the idea that sums are endemic in
science, and mathematics, and engineering.
So we've already seen some applications
in play in mathematical statistics,
starting with polls, drug testing, and
more generally, in estimations of mean.
The central limit theorem crops up in
biology, where as estimates of height,
weight, intelligence, and so
forth, are frequently assumed
to have a normal characterization,
a game presumably because
underlying it is a sum of perturbations
which are not quite controlled.
The normal law crops up in physics,
black body radiation,
if you're taking a course is
thermodynamics, for example.
It crops up in astronomy,
in the cosmic background radiation,
which is the ghostly after
image of the Big Bang.
It crops up in sociology, where we have
large numbers of people milling around in
their own independent fashions.
It crops up in engineering, and
the characterization of noise, noise in
your television sets, noise in your films.
Noise in satellite communications.
It crops up in economics and
mathematical finance.
If you think about agents enrolled in
finance, as many independent entities,
then, again, we have fertile ground here
for a potential bell curve to emerge.
It's a very rich panoply of possibilities.
This is a good place to conclude.
Let's take stock over what we've
done in the last eight weeks.
We began with chance experiments, and
tried to deduce what a mathematical
framework for them should be and
we came up, ultimately with the idea
of a sample space of possible outcomes.
Events as subsets or aggregates of these
sample points and probability measure
as an additive set function which
ascribes chance to these limits.
Building upon this foundation,
we discovered how we could fold inside
information in the form of
conditional probabilities, and
happened then upon the fundamental
concept, that of independence.
Independence is fundamentally a rule of
products, and
once we have this under our belt, we could
immediately delve into applications
of quite some heft and subtlety.
We came back to polls,
and in polls we find
that estimates of populations
are independent sums.
The binomial distributions
swam into view and
the Poisson distribution attached to it,
and the characterization
of these distributions led us
ultimately to the fabulous limit laws.
The law of large numbers, at its part,
is perhaps the most intuitive component
of the theory of probability.
It says something about averages, for
which we have a lot of intuition.
The law of large numbers already
validates why polls work,
why drop testing works, but
digging deeper in, we discovered,
against all odds, this beautiful,
this serendipitous, this marvelous object,
the Bell curve, and this gives us,
ultimately, an ultimate validation for
why all these application
domains thrive, why the mathematical
theory gives you a firm foundation.
It is fitting that we concluded,
as we began, with the toss of a coin.
Proof IDs,
where does a student go from here?
If your objective was to get an
understanding of how chance plays a role
in life around us, to get more
than a superficial understanding,
a, an understanding which is principled,
which is a fair mathematical foundation,
then you have all that you
need with just this tweaks.
As you've seen,
you've got a broad panoply of applications
that you can apply your understanding to.
But of course, there's much more to
the theory that we can't cover in,
in a short introductory
exposure to the material.
For those of you who want to dig further,
well,
there are fertile fields of in front
of you, and I envy you that discovery.
You'll discover the theory of measure and
real analysis.
You will discover the theory of random
processes and you'll along the way you'll
discover wonderful theorems and
fabulous applications.
Have at it.
The British poet Algernon Swinburne
wrote in 1866 in his poem The Garden
of Proserpine, even the weariest river
winds it's way somewhere safe to say,
and so it is for lecturers and
classes even the most
torpid lectures in a course
eventually do conclude, and so do we.
This concludes the entree for
a course in probability.
Of course we do have a little more for
those of you who wish to delve into it.
Say if you want a little
dessert as it were.
The last tableau, tableau 12 is
a dangerous bend of tableau but
the applications in it are delicious.
And if you're curious about a rich
additional set of applications,
have at it.
Otherwise, I bid you adieu.
The river of probability
is a glorious river.
The tributaries are exciting,
exotic, fragrant, and
I've had a long career
of delving into these.
I wish you the same good fortune.
