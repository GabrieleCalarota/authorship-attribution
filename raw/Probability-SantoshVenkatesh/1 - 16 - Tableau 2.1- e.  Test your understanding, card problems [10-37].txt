Now that we have come to a right
understanding of the mechanism of
sampling, with and without replacement,
and of measuring subpopulations,
it is now time to test your
understanding of these three concepts.
Let us go back to an ancient and
venerable idea in the game of chance,
that of a playing card.
Let's start with a standard
pack of 52 playing cards.
These cards come in four suits,
traditionally called spades, hearts,
diamonds, and clubs,
each suit having 13 cards,
usually showing the face
values two through nine, and
then the distinguished values,
Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.
Right, the particulars of these
numbers don't matter for our purposes.
All that matters is that there are four
distinguished suits and 13 cards per suit.
So, here is the first problem.
Take five such packs of cards.
Arrange them on the table.
Flip open the first card
in each of the five stacks.
How many distinct sequences of
cards would you be able to see?
Pause the lecture at this point
while you figure this out.
When you are ready, restart.
Now that you're back, let's examine
how we might analyze this problem.
Five packs placed in a row.
Now, this is equivalent to saying
let's take a pack, one pack of cards,
shuffle it,
create essentially a random sequence, and
flip open the top and see what you get.
Write that down.
Put it back, shuffle it again,
flip open the top card.
See what you get.
That is a second value you'll write down.
Do this five times.
The second experiment I've
given you is formally
equivalent to the first experiment, where
you have five distinguished packs and
you open one card from each pack.
Good, but once you understand that
what we're really doing is specifying
one out of 52 distinguished cards,
and you're going to do it five times,
you'll realize that what you have
specified is an ordered sample of
five elements,
where the elements can be repeated.
It is possible to draw the same
card again and again, and
again, albeit, it is rather unlikely.
All right, how many different ways, of
course, this is sampling with replacement,
and therefore, the answer is going to be,
52 times 52 times 52 times 52 times 52,
or 52 to the power of 5 and,
you see this huge number,
about 380 million possibilities.
Beautiful.
Now, let's take a look at
another version of this problem.
Take a standard pack of cards,
shuffle it, and distribute
one card to each of five distinguished
players, one, two, three, four, five.
How many different sequences can they get?
Pause the lecture again, and
when you are ready, restart.
Now that you're back,
let's consider the problem anew.
We have a single pack of cards and
five distinguished individuals, one, two,
three, four, five.
We are distributing cards
one per individual.
It becomes immediately apparent, that what
we are specifying is an ordered sample of
five cards,
arranged by individual one through five.
And since we're using
just one pack of cards,
it becomes clear that no
card can be repeated.
Each individual gets a distinguished card.
In other words, the number of such
sequences corresponds to sampling
without replacement, and therefore,
the number of possiblies, possibilities,
excuse me, is 52 to the 5 falling.
And that, if we work it out,
gives you something like 300 million.
The difference between this case and
the earlier case, when sampling was with
replacement, is relatively modest, and
a little introspection will convince us
that this, in fact, sure is reasonable.
When you have large populations,
in this case 50, 52,
and we are selecting a modest
number in our sample,
the chance of a replication should
be small, and indeed it is.
Now, let's move on to the third problem.
Read it, pause,
try to do it, think about it, and
when you're ready, resume the lecture.
Now that you're back,
let's go on to a more real setting.
Let's go to the game of poker.
Now, poker is a game of chance,
where individual players,
at least in elementary versions of
this game, get five cards from a pack.
Now, observe that once a player gets
five cards, then she simply keeps them
in her hand, and the particular order
she keeps them does not matter.
How many different poker hands are there?
Again, pause the lecture, think about it,
see if you can work your way through to
a solution, and then restart the lecture.
Okay, now you are back.
When we think about this,
we realize that we are specifying
five cards out of a pack of 52.
This constitutes a standard poker hand,
but the order does not matter.
In other words, we're choosing five
from 52 cards, and of course the answer,
inevitably, is a binomial
coefficient 52 choose 5.
Evaluate it, and you'll find there
are approximately 3 million poker hands.
Consider that this is a vast number.
This is immediately one of the reasons
why poker continues to fascinate.
It is not a game like Tic-Tac-Toe,
where you have such, so
few alternatives that you very
quickly understand all of them.
In poker, you have a large
number of possible alternatives.
That makes the game interesting.
But the number is a small fraction of
how many ordered samples there are.
The moment you look at subpopulations,
you decrease numbers dramatically.
Next problem is that of Bridge.
Now, Bridge is a card game that
continues to be popular in the age of
the Internet because
of its rich structure.
The way Bridge is played is with
a standard pack of 52 cards.
There are four protagonists, or players.
They are traditionally called North,
South, East, and West.
The pack of 52 cards is
distributed 13 a piece,
to each of the four players,
North, South, East, and West.
Each distribution of, of cards to these
four players is called a hand at Bridge.
How many distinguished deal
of hands at Bridge are there?
Pause the lecture, and
when you're ready, re-start it.
Well, now that you're back,
let's see how we might analyze this.
We should have a formal procedure and
understanding of how we're,
we are going to analyze this,
to avoid the perils of over-counting and
under-counting, Scylla and Charybdis.
We want to avoid either extreme.
Now, so, how do we go about doing this?
Well, let's say we're going to start
by specifying the cards that North has,
followed by the cards that East has,
followed by the cards that South has,
followed by the cards that West has.
Okay, here's a, an understanding,
a memoranding,
memorandum of understanding between us.
We're going to specify cards
in this particular sequence.
Well, let's see.
How many ways can you specify
the 13 cards that North has?
Now remember, order does not matter,
and therefore,
North can have 52 choose 13 ways in which
the hand for North can be specified.
Specifying a subpopulation
of 13 cards out of 52.
Very well, so we have 52 choose 13
ways of specifying North's hand.
Having specified North's hand,
we have 13 cards fewer in the deck.
We have 39 cards remaining.
Of those 39, East gets 13, and
there are 39 choose 13 ways of specifying
East's hand from the remaining cards.
Now, once East's hand is specified,
there are 26 cards remaining, and
there are 26 choose 13 ways of specifying
South's hand from the remaining cards,
which leaves us with 13 cards.
And there are exactly 13 choose 13, or
one way of giving those 13 cards to West.
Okay.
Multiplying the possibilities,
independent possibilities multiply,
we obtain the number of possible
deal of hands at Bridge,
is given by a product of binomial
coefficients, 52 choose 13,
times 39 choose 13, times 26 choose 13,
times 13 choose 13.
And this is a huge number.
This number is approximately
5 times 10 to the power 28.
Five followed by 28 zeros.
This is a magnificently large number.
To put it in proper context, consider that
the number of brain cells in all the
creatures that have ever existed on Earth
might be a number like something like,
let's say, oh, about 10 to the power 25.
About 1,000 times less than this number.
This explains, in part,
the enduring popularity of Bridge.
There's a vast, finite but vast, number
of Bridge hands, so large that we're
not going to exhaust all the possibilities
before the solar system dissipates.
So, at this point,
let's take stock, right.
So, what have we done?
We figured out that from
a finite population,
sampling can be done in three
distinguished kinds of ways.
Ordered samples, which can be in two
flavors, with and without replacement.
And sub-populations where
the order does not matter.
To summarize, if we have a finite
set of population of size n,
and we generate a sample
of size k from that set.
If the sample is ordered, and
sampling is with replacement,
then there are n to the power k different
ways you can generate such a sample.
If sampling is without replacement,
then there are n to the k falling
ways of generating such a sample.
And if one is interested
in a subpopulation,
then there are exactly n choose k ways
of engendering such a subpopulation.
