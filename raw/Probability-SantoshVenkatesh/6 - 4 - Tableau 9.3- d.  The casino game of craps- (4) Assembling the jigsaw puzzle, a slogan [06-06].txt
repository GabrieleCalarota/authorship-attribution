Now, let's put everything together.
As I said, all of, uh,other shouting.
So, where the conditional
probabilities for the cases at hand.
Let's reassemble the probability of
winning by appealing to total probability.
Eliminating the cases 2, 3 and
12 where we lose the first trial,
we've got a simple expression.
And now let us plug in for the tens
in the condition of probabilities.
And we've got now
the following expression.
Recall the PK square numerator rises
because the conditional probability is Pk
over Pk plus B7.
And it will multiply by Pk which
represents the probability of throwing K
on the first trial.
So you're going to K of the first trial,
a K of the last trial,
that gives you a Pk squared.
It's a simple expression, and all these
numbers appear in the table in your left.
Which simply read them off, and write
them down, and do a numerical evaluation.
Now, let's proceed.
We can simplify this
a little bit by observing
that probabilities appear in pairs.
P2 and P12 are the same.
P3 and P11 are the same, P4 and
P10 are the same, and so on.
So these probabilities appear in pairs.
And by grouping these probabilities,
we find 6 and 36,
this is P7, 2 and 36, this is P11.
And then for P4 is doubled in.
P10, P5 is doubled in P9,
and P6 is doubled in P8,
so you get twice, 1 over 36 times
the expression in the long brackets.
Okay, and it's a simple fraction,
we can simplify it.
At this point we've exhausted
all the probability intuition.
We should pause before
we do anything further.
To take stock what we've done.
This is elementary, but
there is some subtlety here.
There were two appeals to additivity,
took partition to space.
The first appeal by what
happened in the first step.
The second appeal to additivity by
partitioning based on the number of trials
in the experiment.
And there was an appeal to independence,
which said that individual probabilities
were obtained by simply multiplying atomic
probabilities for the individual trials.
Once you've got all of this,
you've got a numerical answer, but
of course we don't want
to leave it like this.
We should compute it, and we do.
We'll find here, there is a fraction.
Of course, we should evaluate the fraction
because by itself it doesn't say very
much to us.
And we find, hm, this is interesting.
The answer is .4929 recurring.
Now this is interesting.
Now numerically it's just a number.
It's a probability of chance.
But let's take stock of what this is
saying about the experiment itself.
Remember this is a gambling game.
You've gone to the casino
to gamble at craps.
You've thrown dice and
eventually you win or lose.
Now, this tells you that winning at
craps is almost a fair coin flip.
It's almost a 50/50 proposition.
That's interesting.
But here's a rub.
It's almost a 50-50 proposition,
but in fact,
it is biased away from one half,
below one half.
This explains, in part, why the rules
of the game are so peculiar, so arcade,
there's something magical about
the ways the rules were designed.
They were designed to get a chance,
near one-half.
To tempt the unwary gambler into play
more because clearly in a game which is
acutely unfavorable to you
well you've played once,
twice you find you're losing all
the time you won't play if again.
But, if you win almost half
the time you might feel,
ha I could, I can make a killing
here if I'm just lucky.
This temps a gambler to play the game.
But, and
here's the rub, the odds are biased
against you, albeit by a small amount.
But they are biased against you.
In a long run of games of craps,
you will lose your shirt.
Okay, this again explains why
the game's designed the way it is.
It is to make it interesting to play
while guaranteeing a built-in edge for
the casino, for the house.
Now in other gambling games
the house gets an edge,
by simply charging an commission per game.
But in this game the edge is
baked into the game itself.
This is a political age and
again, we should come up with a moral,
a slogan, a summary.
And here it is.
Our slogan; Don't gamble.
The other guy always
knows more than you do.
