And finally,
we are now in a place where we can exploit
the fact that trials are independent.
To come to a right understanding of the
structure, let's take a simple test case.
Suppose, for definiteness,
that we threw 6 on the first trial.
And that's where you
won on the tenth trial.
So if you won the tenth trial and
we threw 6 in the first trial, then here's
a kind of picture that might emerge.
Trials are running from left to right,
one through 10.
6 is what we threw on the first trial,
and then there are trials 2 through 9.
Followed by trial 10 and
sense I'm told that we're winning.
Trial 10 is a 6.
What about the trials 2 through 9.
There are exactly 10 minus
the book end trials.
10 minus 2 trials in
question in the middle.
Sandwiched between the start and
the finish.
80's 10 minus 2 or 8 trials.
We get a succession of numbers.
And all we know is that these
numbers can anything what so
ever excepting 6 because if any of them
were 6 ,we, we would have won earlier.
Or 7,if any of them were 7 you
would lose the game immediately.
And so all the intervening numbers,
10 minus 2 of them have to
be any number except 6 or 7.
What is the probability of
the chance of such an outcome for
this conjoint experiment?
All right, let's take a look at this.
The key idea here.
Is one, additivity, and two, independence.
Let's take a look anew at the sequence.
For any of the intervening trials,
from 2 through 9,
we can get any result
whatsoever except 6 or 7.
By additivity, the probability of
obtaining any of those tainted numbers
shown there is 1 minus the sum of p 6 and
p 7.
In other words, the probability of
any of those intervening numbers: 2,
11, 4, 2, and so on.
Is 1 minus p6 minus p7.
Recall that we know p6 and
p7 from the table on the left.
Very well, this is for
one intervening trial.
Given that the first trial is
a 6 shown shaded in the picture.
What can we now say about the conjoint
trials 2 through 9 followed by 10?
Well we know the last trial has to be a 6
because we're winning on the tenth trial.
And so the probability of that is p6.
We know the probabilities of each of the
outcomes shown in the intervening trials
is 1 minus p6 minus p7.
The trials are independent and therefore
we simply multiply the probabilities.
There are 10 minus 2, or 8,
intervening cases, each with probability
1 minus b6 minus b7, and a final trial
yielding a 6 with probability p6.
We simply multiply all of them out.
And they get 1 minus p6 minus
p7 to the power 8 times p6.
This is the probability of the sequence
of trials 2 through 10 in the picture.
And this case now shows us what
a general picture is going to be like.
We very quickly generalize.
Pick any k between 4,5,6,8,9, or 10.
Pick any end, two or larger.
Now, we got a string of trials.
K is the first trial.
K is the last trial if you're
going to win on the nth trial.
And now, there are n minus 2 trials in the
middle with the book end trials around.
The n minus 2 trials can be neither K nor
7 and therefore the probability of
each of those, the atomic
probability is 1 minus pK minus p7,
there are n minus 2 of those followed
by a final trial which results in K,
total all together.
The probability of
winning on the nth trial
given that K was a sum of the first trial,
where K here is 4,5,6,8,9 or 10 and
n is any number bigger than 2,
is obtained by multiplying
1 minus pK minus p7.
N minus 2 times, one for
each of the intervening trials and
finally multiplying all of that by pK
to return to the original trial and
win the game and now we've got all
the conditional probabilities at hand.
Also over by the shouting,
yes there's a little bit of technical
assembly left over but it's not very much.
Let's put it all together.
So, let's begin by writing
down the progression.
The probability of winning, given
that one of the designated numbers 4,
5, 6, 8, 9, or 10,
happen to the first trial,
is given by a sum from the second trial
onwards of conditional probabilities.
And that we've seen is given by,
this form which is evocative.
Powers of 1 minus pK minus p7.
Multiplied by a pK.
Now, the pK at the end
is of little matter.
It does not depend upon
anything come out of the sum.
What about the things in the middle?
Well, they are.
It's a sum of powers.
The sum starts at n equal to 2 but
the power is n minus 2 so
the first power is 2 minus 2 or 0.
The next power is 3 minus 2 or 1.
The next step power is 4 minus 2 or 2.
In other words what you got
just writing out the sum is pK.
Times 1, Power 0 gives you 1.
Power 1, power 2, power 3,
and so on, add infinity.
Now this looks complex, but
it's actually began really simple.
What we've got is a sum of integer powers.
That looks familiar in
fact we recognize that
this is exactly a geometric series,
an old friend.
Look all that if X is any real
number between minus 1 and plus 1.
And if we sum the powers of x, 1 plus
x plus x squared plus x cubed and so
forth, then this entire series is
called a geometric series, and
it sums to a very simple expression.
It sums to the reciprocal of 1 minus x.
We've got a geometric series right
here inside the square brackets.
Identify the geometric term x with
the term one minus pK minus p7.
And then plug in the geometric
series formula and get pK
times the reciprocal of 1 minus,
1 minus pK minus p7.
A little assembly.
And it simplifies to a beautiful and
delicate expression.
We really couldn't have asked for
a simpler expression.
The probability of winning eventually,
given that we've thrown one of
the numbers 4,5,6,8,9 or 10.
Given a number in k's range.
Is given by pK divided by pK plus p7.
Now this is satisfactory,
it's a complete and
comprehensive answer for
the question but, before we jump forward,
we should pause and take a good hard
look at what we've written down.
See if it informs a problem,
does it tell us something?
An answer as simple as that should have,
must have a direct pathway to it.
If we take a look at this we say well,
what kinds of sequences are we looking at?
We threw a K, and we end.
Either with a K or a 7.
Nothing in the middle is relevant and
therefore if you're going
to only look at an alphabet of K or 7, the
chance of getting K is pK over pK plus p7.
Very intuitive.
Very just.
But very correct.
