Now let's see if we can extract
some more information about
the utility of these coefficients and
where they come into play.
Now we going to go back in time to
an identity which has been known to
practically every one of
the major ancient civilizations.
This is the binomial theorem.
So let's start with two numbers, p and q.
We will sum them and
we are going to raise them to a power.
So p plus q to the power
of 0 is by definition 1.
Anything to the power of 0 is 1.
p plus q to the power 1 of course
is just trite, it's just p plus q.
p plus q to the power of 2 is
the first non-trivial case.
And this is the first major algebraic
identity you saw in elementary school.
p plus q the whole squared is p
squared plus twice pq plus q squared.
Very familiar.
Very comforting.
What about p plus q the whole cubed?
Now this perhaps is a little less
familiar in your memory banks, but
if you scratch around long enough,
you've realized, oh yes, it is p cubed
plus 3p squared q plus
3pq squared plus q cubed.
And if you are persistent enough,
you could.
Resurrect the identity for
p plus q to the power of 4.
That you might have seen once or
twice in your early school years.
All right.
This is nice.
We're beginning to see that
the expansion of p plus q to a power
is something like a polynomial.
In terms of powers of p and q.
Can we come up with a generic,
abstract statement for what a power
of a sum is going to look like?
This, of course,
is the content of the binomial theorem.
This was known in antiquity and.
The binomial theorem
at its heart turns out
to be the key element in Newton's
discovery of the calculus.
So this is a very powerful and
important historically result involving
the, the binomial coefficients.
Now the observations are following.
We can write 1 as.
0 choose 0,
which by definition you recall is 1.
Times p to the power 0.
Times q to the power 0.
p plus q to the power 1 is p plus q.
And we can write that as
a sum of two binomial terms.
One involving 1 choose 1.
One involving 1 choose 0.
As you can verify by just
plugging into the formula.
p plus q to the power 2.
Now that's given by another
binomial expansion.
2 choose 2 times p to the power 2,
times q to the power 0.
Plus 2 choose 1 times p to the power 1,
times q to the power 1.
Plus 2 choose.
0 times p to the power 0
times q to the power 2.
And you could do something similar for
each of the expansions on the screen.
And now a general pattern's
becoming visible and
this is a quantitive of
the binomial theorem.
The nth power of a sum p
plus q can be written as
an expansion involving the binomial
coefficients, starting with n choose n,
and running all the way
down to n choose 0.
To each binomial coefficient you'll
attach a power of p and a power of q.
And the key property is that the powers
of p, and the powers of q, must add to n.
And so you have an expansion,
starting with p to the power n, and
ending up at q to the power n.
This is the binomial theorem of antiquity.
And it continues to be deeply relevant and
important in analysis in the modern day.
