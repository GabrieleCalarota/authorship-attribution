Let us now begin with our perceived
unimodality of the distribution.
It seems inescapably obvious,
when one looks at the graph,
that the atomic mass probabilities
increase and then decrease.
How could one verify such a phenomenon,
in general, for
an arbitrary value for the number of
trials, n, and for an arbitrary value for
the bias probability, p?
Well, naturally enough, if there is
such a tendency, one might be tempted
to consider what happens to subsequent
values of the atomic mass function.
And in particular,
let us consider the ratio
of the probability that there
are exactly k successes
to the probability that there
are k minus 1 successes.
We won't at this stage put any particular
restrictions on what k may be.
And so we just look at two consecutive
values for the number of successes.
For each of them we have
a binomial probability.
For the probability of the numerator,
we just have the ordinary binomial
probability that appears on
the top right of your screen.
And that is the binomial coefficient,
times b to the k,
times q to the n minus k.
In the denominator, we are looking
at a success probability for
exactly k minus 1 successes,
and so all we have to do,
is take our expression for b n of k, and
replace k throughout by k minus one.
And now we've got a fraction.
And it's already beginning to
look a little intimidating.
But, no matter.
Let us begin by expanding out
the binomial coefficients.
Remember, that n choose k
is n to the power k falling
divided by k factorial,
and n choose k minus 1 is
n to the k minus 1 falling,
divided by k minus 1 factorial.
And so if you write it out in gory detail,
oh my goodness,
we get a really messy,
long expression, don't we?
But things are going to
simplify very quickly.
The binomial coefficient n
choose k in the numerator and
the binomial coefficient n choose
k minus 1 in the denominator.
Now, for the fraction, on the left,
you find that it has an extra factor,
n minus k plus 1 in the numerator and
an extra factor k in the denominator.
The powers of p, the powers of q likewise
cancel a numerator and denominator,
leaving an extra p in the numerator and
an extra q in the denominator.
Now, now everything compacts and
simplifies in a hurry.
And we get a nice and
compact little fraction.
So the ratio of two successive
binomial probabilities is given by
n minus k plus 1 times
p divided by k times q.
Hm, what can we conclude from this?
Bear in mind that we are looking for
evidence of unimodality.
That is, that the binomial probabilities
are increasing up to a certain
point and decreasing thereafter.
If one is in the increasing
potion of the curve,
then the success of probabilities
must be increasing and
therefore the ration of successive
probabilities must be bigger than one.
What now,
if p k is bigger than b of k minus 1?
That says the fraction on
the right is bigger than one, and
now we immediately have a criteria.
A successive binomial
probability is strictly larger.
If and only if n minus k plus 1
times p is larger than k times q.
Let us savor this.
This is an elegant and
simple inequality but
of course we do want to simplify
it a little bit further.
Take the quantity minus k times
p on the left of the inequality
to the right hand side.
And now our inequality is
transformed into saying, n times p,
plus p, exceeds k times p plus k times q.
We feel irresistibly compelled
to factor out k on the right.
Leaving you k times p plus q, but
bare in mind that p is the success
probability and q is 1 minus p,
the failure probability, or
in other words p plus q is equal to 1.
We now have a beautiful and
simple criteria.
The success of binomial
probability is larger,
provided np plus p is
larger than k or in other words,
we have a key conclusion.
The binomial probabilities,
b of k, increase as long as k
is no larger than np plus p,
and decrease thereafter.
Np plus p, of course,
in general, is some real number.
P, of course,
is something between zero and one.
So this says that around an integer
next to n times p is where the maximum
of the distribution occurs.
Now, this already gives us some
added evidence in favor of our
estimation of a subpopulation,
parameter p, from a sample.
The binomial distribution has it's maximum
value at around n times p or
in other swords,
Sn divided by n,
the fraction of success is in a sample
of size n achieves its
maximum value just around p.
