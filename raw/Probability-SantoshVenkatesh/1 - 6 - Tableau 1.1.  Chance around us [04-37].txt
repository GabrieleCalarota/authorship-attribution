Tableau 1, Part 1, Chance Around Us.
Probability is, with a possible
exception of Euclidean geometry,
the most intuitive of
the mathematical sciences.
Chance adds language,
pervades our common experience.
We speak of the chances
of the weather turning.
We wager on the sex of a newborn.
Toss a coin at the start of a game.
We bet on a horse race.
Take a chance on
the institutionalized gambling that
masquerades as state sponsored lotteries.
And of course, games of chance have
an ancient and honored history.
Excavations of bone dice
in archaeological digs in
North Africa show that dicing
was not unknown in Egypt.
both games in which players take turns
based upon the role of a die, so
five in the day of the Internet.
And the horse race survives
as an institution.
While the historical palette is rich and
applications pervasive,
a fully modern mathematical theory of
chance dates only to the last century.
This theory and
the rich applications it has spawned
are the subject of these lectures.
The early history of probability
was concerned primarily with
the calculation of numerical probabilities
for outcomes of games of chance.
But, today, the curious student
encounters probabilistic settings at
every turn in diverse applications.
To illustrate, one, opinion polls, and
what the results say about
the population as a whole.
Two, the environment.
Sampling to determine the impact
of an invasive species, or
of polluted concentrations.
Three, data mining.
The prediction of user preferences for
movies, or books, or soap,
from sporadic Internet use, has become
big business in the age of the internet.
For mathematical finance.
Identification of small margins
in a search for order and
predictability in the chaos
of financial markets.
Five, unmanned navigation
over uncertain terrain,
exemplified by NASA's curiosity
rover on the martian surface.
Six, mobile and satellite communications
be doubled by noise and interference.
Seven, astrophysics.
The discovery of the 3K
background cosmic radiation, and
what it portends for the universe.
Eight, particle physics.
The statistical search for the Higgs-Boson
and other subatomic particles.
Nine, biology.
The description of flocking
behavior in wild geese and fish.
Ten, genetics.
Mendel's theory of heredity,
genetic combination, and
recombination, and mutation.
11, epidemiology and
the spread of infection.
12, actuarial science.
The analysis of risk in
the design of actuarial tables,
estimations of time to failure of
machinery, or bridges, or airplanes.
13, banking.
Investment strategies and
the probability of ruin.
14, queuing theory and
the statistical analysis of queues
of telephone calls at an exchange,
data packets and an Internet server,
or cars in a highway system.
The student will be readily able to add
to the list from her common experience.
With chance pervasive around us,
small wonder that we have
a strong intuitive feel for it.
And yet, there are pitfalls for
the unwary.
Following the sage advice of the Hungarian
mathematician, George Polya.
We should begin with the simplest
version of the problem, for
which we don't already know the answer.
And the simplest setting involving chance,
is unquestionably the toss of a coin.
