How does the angle the coin
make at the time it is caught,
determine what the outcome of the toss is?
Well let's take a look.
So recall we have a formula that the angle
at termination is twice omega v over g.
Let's look at all possibilities for
the angle.
If the angle was 0,
then heads is pointing upwards.
And so, I would say, I get a heads.
As the angle increases from 0 to
90 degrees, you'll notice head
is still pointing upwards.
And therefore, for all angles up
'til 90 degrees you will get a head.
Now the moment the coin crosses the 90
degree angle with the horizontal,
now we'll notice head points downwards.
And it is tails that is pointing up.
And tails it remains from 90 degrees
all the way up to 270 degrees.
Beyond 270 degrees the coin
becomes heads again.
And so we get 180 degree swings.
For every 180 degrees, we get heads.
The next 180 degrees we get tails, then
heads again, then tails, and then heads.
And we get this very simple description.
Writing it in terms of radians.
From 0 to pi over 2 radians,
the coin will end up showing heads.
From pi over 2 to 3 pi over 2 radians,
the coin will show tails.
From 3 pi over 2 to 5 pi over 2 radians,
the coin again shows heads,
then tails, then heads, and so forth.
So now we have an understanding of what
the outcome of the coin toss would be
depending upon where is in
this range of possibilities.
The critical points, of course, are right
at angles 90 degrees,
270 degrees, and so forth.
Right at angles, pi over 2,
3 pi over 2, 5 pi over 2,
and in general any odd
multiple of pi over 2.
And so it behooves us to consider what the
equations say right at those branch points
where we're trembling on the edge
between a head and a tail.
So we want to solve
the equations where theta of tau
is exactly an odd multiple of pi over 2.
Now remember theta of tau is twice omega,
omega v over g.
And therefore, in terms of the parameters
that initiated experiment,
the translational velocity will be v,
and the angular velocity omega.
We're looking at the equations omega
v is equal to pi times g over 4.
Omega v is equal to 3 times pi g over 4, 5
times pi g over 4, and so on and so forth.
Of course our question here is,
how do these initial parameters,
the specification of v and
omega, determine the outcome?
Well let's take a look at
the first of these equations.
Theta of tau is pi over 2 or equivalently
omega times v is pi times g over 4.
If we think of omega and
v as free parameters, free variables,
then what you've got describes as
you'll recall from middle school,
the equation of a hyperbola.
And so you've got a line here,
a hyperbolic line corresponding to
all possibilities for the velocity and
the angular velocity, v and omega.
Which give rise to exactly 90
degrees in the terminal coin angle.
And you know there's this we
got this nice hyperbolic line.
Now, what happens if you have a value
anywhere less than 90 degrees?
If the coin toss results in an angle
less than 90 degrees at termination,
then you are going to be somewhere
below that hyperbolic line.
So all choices of v and omega which
lie beneath the hyperbolic line and
are captured by the axes,
that entire region will result in a head.
And now a pretty picture is emerging,
right?
Now of course, the moment you cross
90 degrees, you start getting a tail.
But then there's a next branch point
at 3 times pi over 2, or 270 degrees.
So it all becomes clear that what we
should plot is all the lines at which
the terminal angle is an odd
multiple of pi over 2.
And so here's what it looks like.
So I'll plot it for you.
The hyperbolic line, the,
those values of v and omega for which
the terminal angle is pi over 2, then 3
pi over 2, 5 pi over 2, and so forth.
And we get this family
of hyperbolic lines.
Now, what are the results that
emerge from this experiment?
Well let's start by imagining a coin
toss with a certain speed v and
a certain angular velocity omega,
which is such
that omega times v is beneath
the first hyperbolic line.
Now in this case the coin
is going to show you heads.
And therefore for
everything in that shaded region.
Between the first hyperbolic line and
your axis you're going to get a head.
Now, what if your speed and
angular velocity are such that you lie
above that first hyperbolic line and
just below the next hyperbolic line
where the angle is 3 pi over 2.
At this point you'll get a tail.
In fact, all combinations of speed and
angular velocity which lie in its second
pale band are going to give you a tail.
The next band, these combinations
of speed and velocity, and
angular velocity will give you a head, and
likewise, the next one will give
you a tail, and so on and so forth.
And therefore,
the red shaded regions in the curve
correspond to combinations of velocity and
angular velocity, which will give rise
to a head when you catch the coin.
And the unshaded regions in your
picture will give you points which
result in tails.
