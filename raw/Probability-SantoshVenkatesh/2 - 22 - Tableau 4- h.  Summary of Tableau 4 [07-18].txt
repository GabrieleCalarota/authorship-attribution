Let us now summarize where we are.
To summarize, we want to deal with
collections, sets of objects.
The underlying motive, of course,
is that in chance experiments we've seen,
even in simple settings, that we deal in
the aggregates, collections of outcomes.
And we need a language to be able
to describe these aggregates,
these collections, these sets.
So this is what we need in our vocabulary.
Let's start with the column in the left.
First, what are the raw items?
We start with a universal set.
In the theory of chance, we will
shortly call this the sample space.
Generically, we will represent it by and
uppercase Greek letter Omega.
In practical settings,
Omega will mean different things.
For example, a set of graphs,
a set of pairs,
a set of numbers, a set of functions.
Generically, abstractly, it's Omega.
Elements of Omega, and shortly we'll
be calling them sample points,
are represented by lower
case Greek letters,
in this case, lower case omega,
and there's an idea of membership.
These elements are members
of this universal set, and
we have a membership notation.
Once we have a universal set,
we can form subcollections, and
these lead to subsets, and now we have
notation and terminology for subsets.
A is a subcollection or subset of Omega.
And we have a method of visualizing
these subsets, and their relationships
with each other and the whole, and this
is through the medium of Venn diagrams.
Now I should not overstate this or
oversell this,
Venn diagrams are useful,
but they are limited.
They are fine when you're dealing
with one or two or three sets, but
they will rapidly become cumbersome when
you have more than three or so, okay.
But they're still a useful,
visual mechanism to capture
some ideas of abstraction.
Now once you have this terminology and
notation in, in hand, we go on to
the kinds of things we can do with them.
So this is the second column.
We're talking about basic set operations.
The idea is, how do you construct new
sets from old sets in principled ways?
The three basic operations are,
unions, intersections, complements.
In logic, alls, ands, and nots.
These are the fundamental operations.
With these in hand,
you can construct more complex operations.
Two more that crop up frequently
enough to make it worth remembering
are set differences, A minus B.
Bear in mind that this is not transitive,
this is not commutative, A minus B and
B minus A are different.
And the second are symmetric difference,
A triangle B.
The symmetric difference is commutative.
Okay, it stands for a,
a cleaned up unit as it were,
which eliminates common elements.
These are the basic operations
by which we construct more complex
elements from simple elements.
And finally,
where do these operations lead us?
What kinds of true facts,
theorems can I discover?
The key discovery is that
these operations stand
in the role of addition and
multiplication.
There is an algebra of sets.
The empty set stands in
the role of an additive zero.
The universal set, the sample space,
stands in the role of
a multiplicative unit.
And once you have these in place,
we can do unions and intersections freely
by understanding first, that unions and
intersections can be done in any order.
These operations are commutative and
associative.
And that furthermore,
just as in ordinary arithmetic,
unions distribute over intersections and
intersections distribute over unions.
In other words,
we have a distributive property.
Together this describes
an algebra of sets.
From this understanding we can derive
other deep and interesting properties.
And the key one for us,
is that encapsulated by De Morgan's laws,
the complement of a union is
an intersection of complements,
the complement of an intersection,
is a union of complements.
We conclude by putting together
a methodology for very fine equality.
If we want to show a particular
identity is true for sets,
what we show is that the set on the left
is the subset of the set of the right, and
simultaneously, the subset on the right Is
a further subset of the thing on the left.
Together this will establish equality.
Now we should go back and remember A,
the notation of the terminology,
B, the basic operations.
You should be able to write down unions,
intersections, complements,
set differences, symmetric differences
without having to look at the definition.
If you need go back and
look at a definition,
then there's the clear sign that you
don't really understand the definition.
So this should be hardwired
into your understanding.
And with these in place,
you should remember the basic operations,
the commutative and
associative operations,
the distributive operations, and,
very importantly, De Morgan's laws.
This concludes our little excursus into
the theory of sets, and set operations.
These will establish an alphabet upon
which we can build a theory of chance.
Our next tableau then,
will go back to the kinds of intuition we
built up from our explorations of chance
in common place settings in tableau three.
And use this as a spring board to
launch us towards the elements of
an abstract construction of a,
an axiomatic theory of chance.
This was a theory of chance
discovered by Andrey Kolmogorov,
codified by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933.
So our next step, in the next tableau,
is to build upon this intuition,
use the language of sets
to deduce what we'd want
in a theory of chance, and
put together such an axiomatic theory.
Very abstract I know, but at this point
we're building up notation, terminology,
a language with which we can talk about
interesting and deep applications.
We'll follow it up immediately
in the following tableau by
going back to a humble coin toss.
