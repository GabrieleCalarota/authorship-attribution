We have now come to a right
understanding of the concept of
a universal abstract set,
of subsets of that set, and how to build,
via set operations, more complex
subsets from existing subsets.
The key operations are unions,
intersections and complements.
Now with these under our belts, we can
actually now do some algebra on the sets,
and in a particular form that
we shall talk about shortly.
So here is the basic idea.
When, when I say algebra what,
what comes to mind?
Well, when we do arithmetic or algebra,
we realize well, we add, we multiply.
Okay.
When we add,
a key element is the idea of a zero.
If you add a zero to any number,
you just just keep that number.
When you multiply, a key element is a one.
If you multiply any number by one,
you get back that number.
In the structure of sets, we have specific
sets which have these properties.
And these play the rolls of a zero at
a unit in the algebra of sets, right.
So, if one takes, let's say, a subset A,
and again we have in mind an abstract,
universal set, uppercase Omega in the,
lurking in the background as it were.
If you have a subset A and
you take its union with the empty set,
well what do you get?
Naturally enough,
the empty set has got nothing in it.
A union just expands by pulling in
everything in both the sets, but
the empty set has nothing and therefore
you re, re, retain the original set.
The empty set plays the role of a zero.
Taking the union of the empty set
does not change the original set.
What happens if we take the intersection
of your set A with the entire
universal set omega?
Well, since every element of
A is an omega, manifestly,
then the intersection contains every
element in A and nothing else.
In other words, the intersection
of A with omega is A itself.
Omega stands in the role
of a multiplicative unit.
Oh, very good, so
it looks like we have things which
correspond to a zero and a one.
What about additions and
multiplications more generally, yeah?
What are the key properties that come to
mind when you talk about addition and
multiplication?
Naturally enough, we can add in any order,
and we can multiply in any order.
And this is what is key,
about addition and multiplication.
Now take the time to write down the
identities I've given you on the screen.
Ponder them for a while and when you're
ready, let's deconstruct them, make sure
we come to a right understanding of what
these very basic identities represent.
Oh, now that you're back,
let's take a look at the very
first identity I've shown you.
The assertion is that A union
B is the same as B union A.
Now I will put it to you that
this is manifest and trite.
We could do a formal proof of this,
but it is hardly worth the effort.
Let us, in res, picture what A union B is.
It is a collection of elements little
omega, which are in A or in B or in both.
But if they're are in A or in B or
in both, they belong to the ensemble.
It does not matter which order
I specify A and B does it?
In any case, omega is going to be in A or
B or in both.
And therefore A union B
is the same as B union A.
You can do unions in any order
without changing the outcome.
And the same thing holds manifestly for
intersection.
A intersection B, is the set of elements
omega, which lie both in A and in B.
Or, in other words,
which lie both in B and in A.
In other words, A intersection B, and B
intersection A are exactly the same sets.
Unions and
intersections can be done in any order.
Of course this, in algebra,
in arithmetic, is what,
what we call the commutative property
of addition and multiplication.
Just like addition and multiplication,
unions and intersections are commuted.
Now what we go beyond two subsets?
Suppose we throw in a third subset.
Naturally enough I'm going to call it C.
Again, bear in mind there's an abstract
universal set in the background.
A, B and C are purportedly representing
subsets of that universal set.
One could draw a Venn diagram here, but
of course it's getting more complex here
to show the various interrelationships
between the three objects.
If I have three such subsets,
I could function as follows.
First consider the particular subset
obtained by taking the union of B with C.
Well, that's a set.
What if I take the union
of that set with A?
And, to clarify that here's
the order in which I'm doing things,
we naturally enough use parentheses.
We use round brackets to say first,
take the unit of B with C, and
then take that set and
take its union with A.
Now the assertion is that you would
get exactly the same set if you first
took the union with B, A with B, then
took that set and took its union with C.
Now again, this is almost so
trite as to be not worth mention.
All we have to do is keep in
mind what is happening when,
once I do all these unions.
The result in either case is a sample
point omega, which is in A or
in B or in C, the ors being not exclusive.
Meaning that they could in both A and
B, or both A and
C, or both B and C, or
perhaps in A and B and C as well.
But this description of
omega is the same for
the quantity on the left as well
as the quantity on the right.
And therefore these two ways of describing
this composite set must be the same.
Exactly the same kind of argument works
when you talk about intersections.
The intersection of B with C,
intersected with A is
the same as the intersection of A with B,
intersected with C.
In both instances I'm talking
about sample points omega,
which lie in all three of A, B, and C.
This, of course,
is what in ordinary arithmetic we call
the associative property,
of addition, and of multiplication.
So unions and intersections
are commutative and associative.
In other words,
you can do them in any order.
Now once you understand that I can do
an associative property with three sets,
I can do it with four,
with five, with n sets.
And of course, very quickly we're
running out of symbols in the alphabet.
We capture this abstractly, naturally
enough one of the ways of doing this is
to use subscripts, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, up to say n for
some finite number, to connote
which subset we are talking about.
So A, subscript 1 will be one set subset,
A subscript 2 will be another subset,
A subscript n will be the last subset.
N is any fixed, but arbitrary number.
Suppose I'm given n such objects.
We can think about taking the union of,
the n of A1 union A2
union A3 through U An.
And again, the order in which we
do these unions does not matter.
We could simply write them down in a long
stretch of unions, A1 union A2 union A3
through union An, without bothering
to group them with parentheses.
Exactly the same thing can
be said about intersections.
A1 intersection, A2 intersection,
A3, through intersection An,
again without parenthesis,
there is no ambiguity.
In such settings,
we will use a generic letter like i or
j or k to represent a typical member.
So we'll say A with
a subscript i Is a generic,
the ith subset in a finite collection.
Or perhaps even an a countably
infinite collection.
And in this context,
it is completely reasonable to
say the union of a finite or
infinite collection of subsets, Ai,
is just write down the union symbol the,
the smile, the cup pointing upwards.
Take the union as i
varies over a finite or
an infinite range of the A sub i's, and
there'll be absolutely no ambiguity.
This represents the collective
union of a finite or
a countable infinity of these sets.
Similarly for intersections, simply
write down the intersection operation,
the frown or a cup pointing downwards.
The intersection over all i,
ranging over a finite, or
a countably infinite collection,
of subsets A sub i, just stands for
the intersection of all of them.
And again, there is no necessity for
grouping parentheses.
Okay, of this kind of simplicity in
mathematics of course, makes it easier to
write your own equations without getting
stuck with a lot of pettifogging details.
Good so far.
Now we've through the commutative and
associative properties of unions and
intersections.
Multiplications and
additions can be done in any order.
There's one more property, and
this is what we call the distributive
property of multiplication over addition.
2 times 3 plus 5,
notice, I'm grouping 3 plus 5 first,
and then multiplying it by 2,
we know is the same as 2 times 3,
to which we add 2 times 5.
Multiplication we say,
distributes over addition.
And again now, here's a simple analog when
you talk about unions and intersections.
Say again we are dealing
with three subsets, A, B and
C of some universal set omega.
Form the intersection B with C first.
We know what that means.
The set of elements common to both B and
C.
Suppose I take the union of
that with a third subset A.
The claim is that you get exactly
the same set by first taking the union of
A with B, then taking the union of
A with C, and intersecting them.
It's as if unions distribute
over intersections.
We could do exactly the same thing
by reversing the intersection and u,
union operations.
And here already is one point of
difference between ordinary arithmetic.
Multiplications distribute over additions,
but
additions patently do not
distribute over multiplications.
But in the case of sets, unions
distribute, bute over intersections,
intersections simultaneously
distribute over unions.
The intersection of A with B union C,
is the same as ob, the same object,
the same set, as obtained by
intersecting A with B first,
then intersecting A with C, and
taking the union of those two.
Now, what I've shown
you is two operations,
unions and intersections,
which have the familiar features
of ordinary arithmetic,
addition and multiplication.
Unions generically, loosely standing
in the role of an addition,
intersections standing in
the role of a multiplication.
Very loosely.
These operations have analogs to
the idea of a zero, and a unit.
In this case, the empty set,
and the universal set.
These operations are, commutative and
associative, you can do them in any order.
These operations distribute
one over the other.
Now there's this old adage,
if it walks like a duck, if it quacks
like a duck, it's got to be a duck.
And similarly,
if it walks like an algebra,
if it quacks like an algebra,
it's got to be an algebra.
We call this an algebra of sets,
and we draw freely upon the idea
of algebras that we are already acquainted
with in ordinary number systems.
Okay, now here's the first place where
we now actually have many theorems,
identities, formulae, but
these are basic and important.
We should start with these and,
just as in ordinary algebra,
the next question then is, well,
can I prove deeper results?
Are there more subtle results
which are not immediately apparent
that I can use these rules
of algebra to discover?
Well of course, there are very,
very many in the theory of sets.
But we'll need just one, okay?
And these, again, are familiar to
those of you who have taken logic or
Boolean algebra.
These are called De Morgan's Laws,
all right.
And let me start with
the simplest of these settings.
Let's start with two subsets,
A and B, of a universal set.
Let's start by forming the union
of A with B, that's a new set, and
let them take the complement
of that union.
De Morgan's law asserts that
the complement of A union B
is the same as the complement of
A intersected with the complement of B.
You have a dual statement when unions and
intersections are interchanged.
If you start by intersecting A with
B first and then take its complement,
that is exactly the same thing as
taking the complement of A and
taking its union with the complement of B.
I want to pause to prove these now.
Though you should pause and see if you
can sketch out, to your satisfaction,
a proof or a sketch of ideas which
makes this convincing for you.
Draw a picture.
Ask yourself,
what is the complement A union B?
Then ask yourself,
what is the intersection of
A complement with B complement?
Can you convince yourself
you've got the same object?
Do the same thing with unions and
intersections real fast.
And when you're ready, come back.
Well, at this point I'm going to
defer trying to show you a proof.
Eventually, I'm going to give you
ammunition where you can construct a proof
for yourself.
This is simple, it's not difficult,
and you'll be able to do it quickly.
But let's, very quickly,
expand on this idea.
The basic idea behind De Morgan's
laws is the following.
That if you take a union of a bunch
of objects, and then complement it,
it is the same thing as taking
the intersection of the complements.
Similarly, if you take the intersection
of a bunch of objects and
then complement it, that is the same thing
as taking the union of the complements.
And let's very quickly
provide mathematical notation
capturing this intuition.
And we should pause, and
again, write it down.
In these expressions, I am starting
with a family of subsets A subscript i,
i is going to run through a finite range,
perhaps 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, till 10,
more generally one through n.
Or I could run through a countably infin,
infinite range.
For example, I could run through
all the natural numbers, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, ad infinitum.
Or I could run through all integers 0,
1, minus 1, 2, minus 2 and so forth.
I runs through a finite or
countably infinite range.
And we immediately have analogs
under De Morgan's laws for
countable unions and
countable intersections as well.
These turn out to be hugely important and
useful.
Bear these in mind.
