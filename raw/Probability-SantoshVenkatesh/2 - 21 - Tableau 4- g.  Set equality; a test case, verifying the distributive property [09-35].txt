Now, we could derive a variety of
other identities and formulae,
but these will more than suffice for
our purposes.
Before we conclude,
I should give you a word
on how we can prove identities like this.
And at the heart of what
we are trying to do,
is we're trying to show
that two sets are equal.
And you scratch head and
says this is ridiculous.
If you give me an object,
another object, can't I tell by just
looking at it that they're the same?
Of course I can,
if the objects are finite.
But it gets harder if
the objects are infinite
in terms of the number of elements in it.
It gets harder if the objects
are represented in apparently
very different looking ways.
And so, it would be useful to have it,
in hand,
a procedure which tells us
how we can go ahead and
show that two sets, two objects,
are in fact the same object.
[SOUND] Let's start with a subset A and
a potentially different subset
B of some universal set.
Now, what does it mean to
say that A is equal to B?
Well, you know, the finite domain,
it's easy, right?
If you have ten objects in, in A and ten
objects in B I can just look at them and
say well these are the same
objects like duh.
It's obvious.
But how do you do it if A and
B are infinite?
I can't just eyeball them, can I?
I need a more formal procedure.
Okay, so
what does it mean to say they're equal?
Well if they're the same, then,
there's a two part answer to this.
Reach into the set on your left,
call it A.
Pick out a jelly bean, an object,
an element, a marble, okay, a number.
This is something in A.
If A and B are really the same, then
any object here must have a counterpart
here which is exactly the same.
So the first part would be to say,
that what needs to demonstrate,
that every element in A is also in B.
Sounds very abstract, right?
But we will run through
a concrete setting in a moment.
If I can show this,
what have I actually done?
I've shown that A,
in fact, is a subset of B.
So this is the first
part of a demonstration.
Show that every element in A is also in B,
A is a subset B.
All right,
now I know that A is contained in B.
To show the obvious, we'll settle it.
Repeat the story by saying,
well, here's an element from B.
Pull it out kicking and squealing and say,
well, isn't that in A as well, right?
If this frog,
in this collection of frogs, is in A.
And it's true for
every frog in the collection of frogs
which is B, that the collection
of frogs which is B must be contained
in the collection of frogs which is A.
B is a subset of A.
If I can show that both A is a subset
of B and B is a subset of A,
then I've got no room to wiggle.
I've got no place to turn.
It must be the case that A and
B are identical.
Okay, in abstract settings and
infinite settings this is
always the way we proceed.
We break down equality by first showing
that everything on one side is contained
in the other, and then showing everything
on the other is contained in the first,
and together we achieve equality.
Now this is very,
very abstract, all right.
If you haven't seen arguments like this
before, it looks weird and say, oh gee,
I didn't get it.
Oh, but of course, that's because our
intuition is founded upon finite elements,
finite groups, where inspection can
immediately tell us an obvious answer.
But it gets much harder in abstraction.
It gets much harder when you
have infinite collections.
We can't just eyeball things.
That's why one needs a formal
procedure like this.
Now, here is a formal procedure for
checking equality of sets.
We can put this to work immediately
in checking the validity
of any of the identities or
the formulae that I've shown you.
All right,
let's immediately put this to case and
let's take the test case, the distributive
property of unions over intersections.
We claim that the union of A with B
intersection C is the same as the,
as the intersection of
A union B with A union C.
Now, how would one show this?
Well, let's first start by
showing that every element,
omega on the left hand side,
is also in the right hand side.
If that is the case, then the set, which
is complicated looking thing on the left
hand side, must be a subset of
the set which is on the right.
So let's begin by picking a test element.
Suppose omega is an element
of the set on the left.
Omega is an element of
A union B intersection B, C.
You now need to show that this is also
an element of the set on the right.
Okay, well what does it mean
to say that omega is in
the union of A with B to section C.
Well what does union mean?
Union is a sort of inclusion, right?
It sort of loads things out,
it makes things bigger.
It means that that omega must be in A or
it must be in B intersection C,
or possibly of course, in both.
Their unions are not exclusive.
All right,
now we have too possibilities then.
In settings like this, you know,
I'm very fond of an adage
of the great Hungarian mathematician and
educator, George Pólya.
He used to say,
when you have two things to say,
say first the first thing,
and then the second thing.
And, you look at me and say, like, duh.
Of course it sounds trite and
ridiculous, but I can tell you what
an important and basic principle this is.
Graduate students dealing with
complicated settings in science or
engineering are trying to
keep something in mind,
whether 30 different
varieties of things going on.
They're trying to keep everything in
mind simultaneously and they go crazy.
They've forgotten Pólya's very wise adage,
when you have many things to do,
do them one at a time.
When you have two things to say,
say the first thing first,
then say the second thing.
All right, in our setting, omega is in A,
or omega is in B intersection C.
We don't worry about both
of them simultaneously.
Let's take them one at a time.
Suppose omega is in A, and let's see
where this train of thought goes.
If omega is in A,
since union is an increasing operation,
then omega is certainly in A union B,
and omega is also in A union C.
If omega is in both A union B and
in A union C,
then clearly it is there in
the intersection of the two.
And therefore, omega is in
the intersection of A union B and
A intersection A union C.
Good, we've established that
in the case omega is in A and
omega on the left hand side is
also on the right hand side.
What if omega is in B intersection C?
Ok, here's a second possibility.
Well, if omega is in B intersection C,
then omega must be,
by the definition of intersection,
both in B and in C.
Since omega is in B,
it is there in A union B.
Since omega is in C,
it is there in A union C.
And therefore, is manifested there
in the intersection of A union B and
A intersection C.
In both cases,
an omega on the left is on the right.
And therefore, the set on the left
is a subset of the set on the right.
We have concluded the first part
in the verification of equality.
We now need to reverse the direction and,
of course, the proof is exactly the same.
It follows exactly the same pattern.
And as a sanity check,
I will let you work through the steps.
Mirror what you did on the left,
do it on the right.
And verify now that every omega, which is
on the right, must also be on the left.
In other words, the set on the right
is a subset of the set on the left.
And with both parts established,
we have nowhere to turn.
The two sets must in
fact be exactly the same.
Notice already here in
a setting like this,
ordinary intuition was
not going to suffice.
We actually needed a formal methodology,
a way of proceeding to show that
these two objects were the same.
And here's a need to manifest for
a formal procedure.
Of course, you can use this to verify
the other distributive property that
intersections distribute over unions.
Do so.
It will be a valuable test
case of your understanding.
And, to burnish your burgeoning
understanding of a method of proof,
try the following.
Now go back and try to verify De Morgan's
laws using this concrete procedure.
When you're ready, come back, and
we will summarize, what you've done.
