Okay.
Now that we've understood how to count
in situations when sampling is with
replacement, let's move on to a setting
where sampling is without replacement.
So let's change the problem a little bit,
right?
Balls and urns are getting a little old.
Let's try this one.
Again, the problem is quite elementary,
right?
But here's a metaphor.
How many different ways are there
of distributing three flags onto say,
five flagpoles?
On retrospection, is there anything
different from the previous problem?
I replaced balls by flags, urns by sticks,
but haven't done anything
fundamentally different.
And a little thought might
convince you that, yes, oh yes,
there might be one thing that's different.
Perhaps it is not advisable to
put two flags onto the same pole.
One might start an international incident.
Okay, so what could one do?
Well, in which case, each flag has to
have a distinguished pole all to itself.
Oh, let's see what happens now.
So, for example, the blue flag
could go on to the fourth pole.
The green flag could go
on to the first pole.
The purple flag could go
on to the second pole.
Now, how do you describe this compactly?
Well, in exactly the same
way we did before.
All we have to do is agree on an order for
flags, in this case blue, green, purple,
in that order, 1, 2, 3,
and specify by number,
a triple of numbers identifying which
flag-sticks these flags landed on.
So in our case, Bob's your uncle,
there we go, 4, 1, 2.
And that compact triple captures
the mathematical essence of
this entire problem.
How do we abstract this?
Of course, the numbers in the three
locations could be quite arbitrary.
And so here we go.
If we put in the three fla,
three flags onto these five poles,
the three locations could be specified
by an ordered triple, j1, j2, j3.
Again, j1 represents
the location of the blue flag.
J2, the location of the green flag.
J3, the location of the purple flag.
And now we want to count
how many ways it's going to
be possible to have such deployments.
You understand, of course,
that the metaphor of flags and
poles here, could be replaced
by anything else you like.
For example, we could have had
three balls and five urns.
And with the understanding
that in this new experiment,
an n is not allowed to be reused.
In other words,
this is a question of sampling urns or
flags-ticks without replacement.
Well, let's do the counting.
The first number, the first flag,
could go onto any of five poles.
That gives you five possibilities.
The moment you place a first flag on a
pole, then you only have four poles left.
Remember, sampling poles
is without replacement.
Which means that the second flag,
the green flag,
has got four possibilities to select from.
And that leaves only three
possibilities for the purple flag.
By the basic rule of counting
independent possibilities multiply and
therefore the number of ways
you can specify flag-sticks for
your three flags is 5 times 4 times 3.
Now that's 60.
But the number again is not particularly
important for our purposes.
The logic is what is important.
Now this looks a very much like
what we had in the previous slide.
There it was 5 times 5 times 5, here,
it's 5 times 4 times 3, because
re-sampling elements is prohibited.
But, the structure is very similar.
It looks like a power.
Well, why don't we put in some notation
to capture this kind of structure.
Which is reminiscent of an ordinary power.
We call this 4 times 4 times 3,
5 to the 3 falling.
We represent it with a five
with a power three and
an underscore under three to remind
ourselves that this is really
not an ordinary common garden variety
power that we saw in elementary school.
But a new kind of power.
This is a falling power.
The five tells us we have a product
of terms starting with five.
The three about tells us there are going
to be three terms in the product and
the underscore tells us that each term
is one less than the previous term.
5 times 4 times 3.
This is sometimes called
Pochhammer's symbol or
the falling factorial and
we will see why in just a moment.
Right, so again, symbolism, and
this is supposed to evoke in you
a familiar idea, the object of a power.
But this is a slight variation
on that particular theme.
Now, once you've got
this basic idea in place,
we jump forward and
we generalize everything.
So, consider a population
now a set of n objects.
So these n objects represent your n urns,
your n flag-sticks, or what have you.
You are going to select from them, but
the selection is going to
be without replacement.
So, let's say we select k
objects without replacement,
we have an ordered sample of size k.
How many are there?
Well, the first number can
be specified in many ways.
Having specified one number,.
That particular number,
that particular flag-stick is skewed.
You have to select from the remaining n
miles one flag-sticks for the next number,
and then from the remaining n minus 2 for
the number after that.
And you go on through k terms.
The last element is selected from
n minus k minus 1 elements,
which have already been specified.
And so, here we go.
The number of ways in which
we can select k objects in
an ordered sample from
a population of size n,
where sampling is without replacement,
is n to the k falling.
A product of k terms starting at n.
Each term one less than the previous term.
Now, before proceeding,
I should say a word about this
unusual terminology falling factorial.
Now, where does this come from?
Let's go back one more time, and
take a look at this in
a slightly sanitized setting.
So, suppose we have three balls.
Our familiar peach, green,
purple balls, and we are interested in
how many different orderings
of these balls we can achieve.
So let's try to look at this, alright?
So, we can write down by inspection or
by trial and error, by hit or
miss, a certain sequence of balls.
And they appear on your
screen on your left.
Now, how do we know we've
got all arrangements, right?
There are six different arrangements.
And the idea is to be very,
very, very, very systematic.
So this is an example of what's
called a lexicographic arrangement.
Now, in a combinatorial settings,
it is exigent that we are very precise.
We don't miss elements, and
we don't double count elements.
These, in fact,
are the 2 golden rules of combinatorics.
Don't over count and don't under count.
Of course,
it sounds completely banal and trite.
Right?
Of course, you don't want to over count,
and you don't want to under count.
How do you avoid over counting?
How do you avoid under counting?
The idea is to be very systematic,
to set things up as you would, for
example, in the index of a book or
when you count pages.
This is the lexicon, and that is
the basis of a lexicographic arrangement.
A is before b is before c.
One is before two, before three.
And in our dictionary of translation,
green is before purple is before peach.
And then you go ahead and
set up very systematically a system
of arrangements, and we have six.
This is excellent.
Now, let's put this in
the quantics of sampling.
Suppose we start with a population,
a set of n distinct objects.
How many different ways can
these objects be arranged?
In the board in front of you we've got
an arrangement of three objects and
there are six possible arrangements.
Now, when you think about n objects you
realize that what we're trying to do is
specify a sequence, an ordered sequence of
n objects, where no object is repeated.
That is what we mean by an arrangement.
A permutation.
In other words,
every such arrangement results in
an ordered sample of n elements.
In this case, k is equal to n.
These are selected form a population
without replacement from a population of
n elements which means that
every one of your n elements in
the population appears exactly
once in this ordered sample.
Oh, but we know the answer to this.
When we selected k without replacement
from population of size n,
we add n to the k falling possibilities.
When we select n out of
a population of size n,
then by definition we
have n to the n falling.
Recall that this falling notation
means that you start a product at n.
The thing in the exponent tells you how
many terms there are in the product.
In this case,
where there are n terms in the product,
and each term is one less
than the previous term.
And when you work it through, you find,
you start at n, n minus 1, n minus 2,
and by the time you get to the nth,
or last, term, you hit 1.
In other words,
on the right, you have a product of
all the numbers from 1 through n.
Of course, we have another name for this.
This is what we call the factorial.
N factorial.
So this is now the origin of the
terminology, a falling factorial notation.
If you look at n to the k falling.
And you select k to be n itself,
you'll get back n factorial.
And so now,
this is a mnemonic, a visual feature
which tells you what this thing means.
It is related to a factorial.
You know, it's very much like
a duck you might observe.
If you see an object,
if it walks like a duck, if it quacks
like a duck, it's got to be a duck.
If this thing walks like a factorial,
if it quacks like a factorial, well,
it's got to be a factorial.
And therefore, we call it a factorial,
or more precisely, a falling factorial.
Now, a little convention makes a life
easier, smooths our analysis park.
What if n is 0.
By convention,
we say that 0 factorial is 1.
Thus far, we've looked at settings
where we have an ordered sample from
an underlying finite set or population,
and the sampling was with or without
replacement, and the counts, therefore
became ordinary powers or falling powers.
Now let's move on to a setting
where we extract a subpopulation.
In other words,
a sample without an implicit order
from the population at large.
