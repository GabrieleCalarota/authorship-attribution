The Central Limit Theorem takes pride of
place of the crown jewel of
the classical theory of probability.
We have seen it's long and
glorious history as it evolved from
it's early beginnings in 1733.
To the very rich all-encompassing domain
that it seems to encompass today.
Let me conclude our presentation
of the central limit theorem with
an application in a setting of
some subtilty the issue of fraud.
And what I will talk about is
fraud in academic circles or
at least the accusation of it.
What statistics has to say about this and
where the central limit
theorem comes to play?
So this is the curious case of
Sir Cyril Burt, psychologist.
So let me start by telling
you what the background is.
Cyril Burt was one fo the preeminent
psychologists of the 20th century.
He was a fellow of Jesus college at Oxford
University, a fellow at the Royal Academy.
He was the first psychologist
to be knighted in 1946.
And he retired from his professorship
at the University College London
in 1950 after a long and
extraordinarily successful career.
He continued to be very prolific,
publishing widely after his retirement.
And from 1950 onwards
until his death in 1971,
he published a large number of papers.
He was well known for his studies of
identical twins, very influential studies.
But today I shall look at a study or
phase on the heritability of intelligence.
He published a paper on IQ's and
how intelligence is passed on
from parent to child in 1961,
turned out to be a very influential paper.
This was a setting when he died in 1971,
10 years after the publication
of the paper and
everything was rosy for
a few years until 1974.
Leon Kamin at Princeton University
published a book called,The Science and
Politics of IQ in which he cast doubts
about the usability of Burt's data.
With a strong imputation,
that perhaps there was academic
fraud in the presenting of the data.
This was of course in the, in the words
of Tennyson in the Lady of Charlotte,
a rift in the lute which growing
still makes the music mute.
Cayman's accusation
against a personage of,
of such renowned caused immediate and
strident protest.
Colleagues, students,
of Burt's left to his defense and
accusations and
counter-accusations were traded freely.
The story has legs and
today a very large number of point and
counterpoints have been raised
in the scientific press and
in the popular press on this issue.
What we shall do today is take a look
at what statistics can say about this?
And as we shall find that yes indeed,
a principled
statistical approach in the problem
can shed some light on these.
But as always in the application
of form of models,
mathematical models to a physical reality.
We shall find that there are limitations
to what a models can say and
there are somethings that statistics and
probability cannot say.
So this is the background, so
let us leap directly into the issue and
this is the case of IQ data that is
presented by Burt in his 1961 paper.
So this table is taken directly from
Burt's paper and the listener should
feel free to verify that the numbers
are present and are indeed accurate.
It is unfortunately, all too easy to make
mistakes in this kind of data entry and
in the analysis of data like this that
said some caution is always advisable.
This was one of two tables that
appears in Burt's paper of 61.
This was his presentation of IQ data,
Intelligence Quotient data for adults.
Now, a student today has
a shortly had of IQ test and
possibly has taken that when they
were in elementary school perhaps or
perhaps out of curiosity
over the internet.
The test itself in its
original form was developed
in 1912 by the German
psychologist William Stern.
Today, if one takes a test out
of curiosity over the internet,
one could do a test in say 20 or
30 minutes,
though such tests are considered
unreliable, they're unproctored.
A proctor test might draw anywhere from
an hour and a half to two hours, right?
So these tests are not simple and
easy to administer they actually
take some time to do it carefully.
Keep that in mind this has a bearing
upon how the story unfolds so
here are Burt's data.
Now, what did he present?
Well, what Burt did in this paper was
break up adults into six
professional categories.
What he called category one,
a higher professional.
All the the way down to category six,
unskilled.
These IQ tests were administered to
a population categorized by these
occupational characteristics and then
IQ scores were recorded and tabulated.
So you notice that, you know,
have a spread of IQ scores and
if one believes that higher professional
attainment is somehow correlated with
intelligences then perhaps the table seems
to reflect that kind of understanding.
In any case,
these are the numbers that were reported.
Pause and take a look at them, right?
So the IQ scores, as is typical range
from somewhere around 50 to 60,
all the way up to past 130.
Scores in the 50's and
60's are considered deficient.
Scores above 140
are considered a genius level.
I'd say I can see now spread of scores for
intelligence.
Pause the lecture and look at the table
from a higher vantage point, right?
Let's not do an analysis yet but
look at the numbers heuristically,
does anything leap out at you?
Does anything look
a little strange perhaps?
Something that needs perhaps explanation,
right?
Pause and take a look and
come back when you are ready.
Oh, your back.
Now, perhaps one thing
that might have struck
you is that the number of people
that were tested was exactly 1,000.
Where exactly 1,000 people tested?
If you've done any kind
of data collection,
you realize that it's sometimes difficult
to get such perfect whole numbers, right?
We might anticipate, we try testing and
we end up with 998 or perhaps 1,002.
But perhaps that's okay, one could imagine
that a, a succession of tests were done
until exactly 1000 thousand people were
tested and then it was stopped, perhaps.
Here's another number which
looked a little surprising.
In the last column,
in the aggregate of the total the mean
IQ there we take mean of the numbers
in the table, a tabulate and
you find that the total is exactly 100.
Now this seems certainly a little
more strange, one would perhaps
not anticipate that if one collects data
at random, at thousand pieces of data.
That the averages would add up so
beautifully to a whole number,
exactly 100 perhaps that one
actually does need some explication.
Now, here is one more feature to keep an
eye on and I'll ask you to remember this.
In the higher professional classes,
class one,
it looks like there are exactly
three people who are tested, okay?
Was it three exactly,
the numbers of course feels a little low
to be forming statistical conclusions but
perhaps that is in fact reasonable.
For many case, according to the table
three individuals are tested in
the higher professional category.
Now, this is the first of two tables that,
that provides in this paper.
And except for the formating I've tried
to keep the structure of the table
to keep the integrity of
the structure intact.
Now, Burt was interested in
the heritability of intelligence.
Is intelligence actually passed
on from parent to child?
So, to accompany this table of IQs for
adults he listed now
a table of IQ's for
their children and here it is.
And again,
it's a table much like the previous one.
The children were tagged with
a professional class of the parent.
So again the children appear at
the professional classes one through six,
from higher professional all
the way down to unskilled and
those classifications
refer to their fathers.
Again, you notice a spread of value and
there seems to be a high correlation again
between children of more accomplished
parents and potentially higher IQ's.
And with children of perhaps
less accomplished parents
seeming to have more variability and
perhaps smaller IQ's.
Again, one believes that intelligence
is a heritable characteristic and
that higher professional classes,
higher attainment in professional life.
Suggest a higher attitude,
a higher intelligence then such data seem
to be in support of these hypotheses.
The game, the two factors that
we looked at earlier strike us.
We've got exactly 1000 children
represented in this table.
The mean IQ across these
1000 is again 100 and
in the higher professional category,
we have three children represented.
So there are questions to be answered
about the data and its presentation.
To resolve them, we are going
to have to turn to Burt's paper.
