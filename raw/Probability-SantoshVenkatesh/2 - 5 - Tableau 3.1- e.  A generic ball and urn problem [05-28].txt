Okay.
Now let's see what we can
draw from this so far.
Our chance experiments have had a finite
number of possibilities, albeit possibly
a very large number, that we're going to
sample from these possibilities randomly.
Meaning, uniformly with equal chance for
every possibility.
Outcomes, then are one
of these possibilities.
Events are aggregates of outcomes and
attached to every event is a chance or
a number, a probability measure.
The two examples I've given you have been
particularly susceptible of a ball and
urn modeling mindset.
We can now use this and use this kind
of modelling framework in a variety of
combinatorial settings where
we have random sampling.
So let me start by giving
you a more abstract version,
like a simple abstract version of
this problem for you to muse on.
Suppose one has two balls.
Call them say, a and b.
And one places them
randomly in three urns,
call them one, two and three.
What are the chances that the middle urn,
the central urn is occupied?
Pause the lecture and say,
if we can built up to an answer.
Okay.
Now that you're back,
let's see how you did.
So this is the setting.
It's a generic ball and urn problem.
And in this case, of course,
there is no verbal camouflage
around the balls or the urns.
Right?
We're not talking about dice or people or
birthdays or the faces of the die.
Now, I have to say we already modeled
it and now we have two balls.
They could, for example, be two dice or
two anything whatsoever, two people.
Now we're going to place
the balls in three urns and
now we need a model for it.
A clean mathematical way
of viewing the experiment.
Now, if you've done what is depicted
on the right of your screen,
then that'll be completely consonant
with the kind of terminology and
notation, the way we viewed
our first two experiments.
So for example, we could say,
well, there are three urns.
Let's call them one, two and three and
let's then give an ordered pair of values.
The first value tells you where the first
ball went, which urn it was placed in.
The second value tells you
where the second ball goes.
So now we have an ordered pair where
sampling is with replacement from
three urns.
And therefore, you have 3 to the power 2
or 9 possibilities for the pair of balls.
Now in this setting, you can say, well,
are there other ways of
viewing the problem?
And of course,
we could view it much more graphically.
And this is illustrated on the left.
For example, say you have balls a and b.
Physically, show the urns at
locations here, here and here.
One, two and three.
And simply place the balls in
these locations in various orders.
Now once you of course do this
systematically, lexicographically.
So, one could for instance.
First, identify all possibilities
where both balls go to a common urn.
Both go into the first urn.
Both go into the second urn.
Both go into the third urn.
And then identify systematically,
possibilities where you have
each ball in a distinct urn.
And you could do this, for example,
by first identifying all the cases
where the first urn is occupied.
So either the first ball goes in there,
a goes in there and
then b goes in one of
the remaining two places.
Or b goes in the first urn and then a goes
in one of the two remaining places.
This eliminates all possibilities
where the first urn is occupied.
Now we eliminate possibilities where the
first urn is unoccupied and the second urn
is occupied, which means either a is in
the second urn or b is in the second urn.
Which means the remaining ball
must be the third urn and
we've got all the possibilities and
again there are nine.
All roads to lead to room, right?
There are many notations one could adopt,
which could describe
the underlying problem.
Of course, it is important to
pick a notation which is compact,
which is not overly cumbersome and
complex.
In that case,
either of these two would serve.
What is the event of interest to us?
Well, the abstract event
shown of any particular color
is simply that the second urn is occupied.
If you picked a numerical pair-wise
representation of the outcomes,
this means that you've got
a pair of numbers where one or
both of the pair takes the value two.
And you identify there are five
possibilities and you write them down.
If you take the more visual
notation on the left,
then we simply identify urns where
the middle urn is not empty.
And again, there are five possibilities.
All roads do in fact, lead to room.
We assume that we have random selections,
so all outcomes are equally likely.
And therefore, the chance that the second
urn is occupied is exactly five in nine.
