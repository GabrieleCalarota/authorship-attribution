So where are we?
We've now computed,
in principle, the table of u's.
We've computed the table of f's.
These represent probabilities
of success runs terminating for
the first time or
at subsequent times at trial n.
What next?
Well, of course we're interested in
the probability of a success run on or
before trial n.
In other words, we want to compute Sn.
But Sn is determined
completely by our slope here,
by the values of the first success
run probabilities, the f's.
And therefore, since we know the f's,
we, in principle, know the S's.
Let's start.
Well, we have the initial conditions,
around three conditions,
s1, s2, s3, and s4 are all 0.
What if n is equal to 5?
Well s5 is the sum of f1 through f5, but
f1 through f4 contribute nothing and
therefore we simply get a 5 or
2 to the power minus 5.
s6 gives you the sum of f's,
f1 through f6.
The only contributions are from f5 and f6.
And that gives us 3 times
2 to the power of minus 6.
One more for sanity,
s7 is the sum of f1 through f7.
The only contributions are from f5,
f6 and f7, put it all together and
we get [SOUND] 1 in 16, interesting,
the probabilities are increasing.
And perhaps even unexpectedly fast.
Let's see what the numbers come out to be.
So, just imagine plugging
it into your computer, and
just generating one value after the other.
Here are the first 20 values for
sn, s1 through s4 are 0,
s5 is 1 in 32, s7 is 1 in 16, and
then we have a bunch of fractions,
right, of course,
the fractions are not undefined.
So let's promptly look at
them again in a decimal form.
And in this time,
let's look at a table of s values,
where n ranges from multiples of 10: 10,
20, 30, 40,
50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100.
And here are the probabilities for
each of those values of n
of observing a success run of length
five at or before that value of n.
So, s10 is about 11%.
It is actually not unlikely at
all that even in ten tosses,
you'll get some run of length five.
It'll happen one in ten times,
approximately.
s20 is already about 25%.
This is getting serious.
This is not at all unexpected.
If somebody says they threw, tossed a coin
20 times, and somewhere in that sequence
they found a success run of length five,
the chance of this is almost one in four.
s30, the chances are better
than one in three.
s40, the chances are almost one in two.
And s100 the chances are about 80%.
Of course this is what we'd eluded to
in our first tableau in
our introductory tableau.
When we're talking about the amazing and
non-intuitive
aspects of fluctuations,
the chance of a success
run of a given length, in this case,
five, is not at all trivial.
At s100 we have a resplendent 80% or
slightly more than 80% chance,
of, in a 100 times is finding a success
run of length five or more in between.
If you think back to those sequences,
one random, one artificial,
you realize where the source of
the confusion was in our intuition.
Immediately, we have a slogan.
And, to put it succinctly,
it is not at all unlikely to see
a success run of length five in even a
moderately small sequence of coin tosses.
This already begins to answer
the fundamental question we
raised about a basketball player and
two opposing hypotheses.
But before we come to it it
will be wise to step back.
We've worked very hard on this one.
Take a look at the framework
as a whole and
see whether we can discern patterns,
extensions, generalizations.
After all, we worked really hard on this.
We should get some value for it,
some fruitful that's other than
just we've solved only one problem.
Hopefully come back and take a look
at the issue of the course end.
