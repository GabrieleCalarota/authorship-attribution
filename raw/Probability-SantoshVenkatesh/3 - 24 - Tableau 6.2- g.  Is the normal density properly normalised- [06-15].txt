So the normal density is patently
positive everywhere as a function.
Is it properly normalised?
And to check if it is, we have to
look at the area under the curve.
So remember phi of x was e to the minus
x squared over 2 divided by the square
root of 2 pi.
I want to integrate this and
see if I get 1.
The student might want to pause and
see if she can play with it.
I mean this looks promising.
I mean you've done exponential integrals
before and this looks like something that
with a little bit of tweaking
should get you there.
And if you're curious,
pause and try it out.
Now that you've come back.
You'll have realized that if you tweak it
the usual substitutions
just don't seem to work.
You keep getting things
which are not quite right.
The fastest way through this is
to rely unabashedly on a trick.
It's a simple trick, but it is not
at all obvious that this particular
trick is going to work with a lot of
experience with the normal distribution.
So, here's the trick.
If this integral is to be 1,
then squaring it is 1 squared,
and that should also be 1, right?
The integral is clearly positive.
So, if I look at the square
of the integral, and
I can show the square is unit,
then the integral itself must be 1.
So here's a very simple idea.
It sounds like a crazy idea.
But, but humor me.
Square the integral.
Now if you square it
then what are you doing.
You're taking the integral and
multiplying it by itself.
Right?
An identical copy.
But I don't want to mix up the variables,
right?
So you have variables of integration.
These are dummy variables.
Right, so let's call the dummy variable of
integration for the first integral x, and
let's call the dummy variable of
integration for the second integral,
naturally, y.
Of course these are copies of each other,
aren't they?
So now we've got two
integrals side by side.
This is not already looking promising.
it looks a lot worse than
the integral we started with.
But again, bear with me.
Let's assemble these integrals together.
There are two square root of
2 pi's in the denominator.
Multiply them to get a 2 pi,
pull them out of the integral,
they don't depend on x and y.
And they have two exponential functions.
If you multiply two exponential functions
then by the usual rule of exponents
the exponents will add, and therefore
this pair of integrals is the same as
1 over 2 pi times a double
integral of an exponential
function with exponent minus one-half
of x squared plus y squared.
Dy dx.
And you look at me and says the man's
gone stark staring, staring mad.
A single integral's bad enough and
now he's given us a double integral.
Let's pause,
something clever has happened here.
Take a look at the integrant.
In particular, the exponent.
It's X squared plus Y squared.
Does that ring a bell?
Does that remind you of something?
Maybe an activistict talgate memory.
Maybe you're reminded
a rectangular-to-polar
coordinate conversion.
If you look at a rectangular
pullout transformation
then you replace the coordinate
x by r times cosine of theta.
R is a radial parameter,
theta is an angular parameter.
Y then will the r times sine of theta?
Then you find that r squared is
exactly x squared plus y squared.
Now here is where the cycle comes in.
There is the radius squared of a circle.
Excellent.
And dy dx becomes r, dr, d theta.
And therefore, by going to a polar system,
we obtain 1 over 2 pi
outside the integral.
The integral over r runs from
radius 0 to radius radius infinite.
The inner integral over theta runs
over all angles from 0 to 2 pi.
The integral, well x squared plus
y squared is exactly r squared.
It becomes e to the minus
r squared over 2.
And dy dx becomes r d theta dr.
We've made progress here.
Because in the double integral
we find a portion of integrant
doesn't depend upon Theta.
It can come out of the inner integral and
therefore we get an outer integral
over r and an inner integral
from 0 to 2 pi of d theta.
Of course, the integral from 0
to 2 pi of D theta is just 2 pi.
And therefore we get
now a single integral.
Multiplied by 2 pi.
We strike out 2 pi in the numerator and
the denominator and
that leaves us a single
integral to evaluate.
Superficially it looks like
the integral we started with.
But with one critical difference.
There is a term r in front of the dr.
And this immediately suggests that perhaps
a standard change of variable might work.
And indeed it does.
Suppose we replace r squared over
2 by a variable of integration, t.
Then dt becomes rdr and
with this change of variable,
our integral collapses into the form.
An integral from 0 to infinity of
a decaying exponential function
e to the minus t.
Of course this is a completely
standard exponential integral and
we simply write the answer down.
We get 1 minus 0 or 1.
Indeed as must.
So in fact the normal density
is indeed properly normalized.
And this analysis has showed us
also something about the origins of
the mysterious square root of 2 pi,
the demonitator.
It arises because of a certain circular
symmetry that is inherent in the normal.
Okay?
But I'm getting ahead of myself
