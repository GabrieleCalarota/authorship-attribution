Let's consider,
how to create new sets from old,
using basic binary set
theoretic operations.
The kind of pictures you have
mentally is of some universal set.
A subset A, some of the subset B,
and the sets, potentially can
overlap in some or all elements.
The simplest of the operations or
one of the two simplest operations
we can imagine, is we're simply
lumping everything together into
a bigger basket, into a bigger set.
This operation is called a union.
And the word union in set theory
has a very particular connotation.
It represents the mathematical
object on the right of your screen.
It represented visually by
the bigger blob I've given you.
It stands,
if you've done any Boolean algebra or
logic, for the logical OR operation.
And we describe it compactly,
succinctly by A at
B with a connecting operation which
looks like a smile, a cup face up.
We call this A union B in words and
this stands for a consolidated set.
It is, in our descriptor notation,
a collection of elements,
little omega, colon,
satisfying the following property.
Little omega is in A, or
little omega is in B.
Notice they include such
relationships which are put in there.
Notice it's a small, compact
description of what this object is.
Bear in mind that in mathematical logic
and in set theory, OR's are not exclusive.
What this means is little
omega can be in A or
it can be in B or
actually it could be in both.
So we are using OR,
unlike in casual language, we are using OR
in a non-exclusive sense.
In ordinary language
when we use the word or,
we implicitly think of
it as being exclusive.
This or that, but not both.
But in the setting here,
we mean, either or both.
Look, here's a simplest operation for
building a more complex set,
from two basic sets.
The union operation.
As always, when there a mathematical
equations on screen, you should take
the time to write them down, pause,
absorb them, before you continue.
When you're ready, start again.
The next of the fundamental operations,
is called the intersection operation.
For those of you who have done Boolean
algebra, it's stands for a logical AND.
We denoted,
as you saw in the previous slides,
using a frown or a cup upside down.
We say A intersection B.
And that represents, is defined
by the description on the right.
It stands for the collection of objects,
little omega, of course,
it is underlying universal abstract set.
Which satisfy the following properties,
little omega is in A and also in B.
And if you're looking at our Venn diagram,
then we're thinking of those
points which are in the sliver,
in the lens, which is occupied by
the intersection of those two objects.
Right, so the Venn diagram gives us
a visual idea of what is going on.
As a sanity check, you should ask,
well what if A and B are disjoint?
What is the intersection?
As you saw on the previous slide, if
the sets are disjoint, A here, B here, and
there's nothing in common, then
the intersection must be the empty set.
It's got no elements.
The third basic operation
is that of negation.
In set theory it's called
the complementation operation.
In Boolean algebra, it corresponds
to the logical NOT operation and we
give it the following name, description,
which stands for a formal definition.
The complement of A, in words.
We represent it by A with
a stylized c as a superscript.
The c, of course,
standing for complementation.
Negation, the NOT operation.
All of this stands for a set.
What is a set?
Those elements little omega
which do not belong to A.
Notice that we'll use an inclusion
relationship in the membership operation
with a slash across it.
The slash says that it is not a member, so
we're looking at elements
omega which are not in A.
And all elements omega with
the property that they're not in
A form the set called the complement of A,
and we denoted it AC.
Visually, again, it's as if you've got
your abstract space, your universal set.
Upper case omega and
you excise, surgically remove,
all the elements which
formed the subset A.
What remains is A complement.
Again, you should take the time to
write down these relationships,
ponder them, absorb the notation,
the language,
the logic, make sure you understand them
draw a picture or two before you proceed.
And now as a sanity check, let's try this.
Suppose you look at a set
which is the complement of A.
A with a superscript c.
Well that's a set, and it is a subset
of the original universal set.
Naturally enough, I could imagine
doing a compliment of that set.
What is the compliment
of the compliment of A?
Pause, think about it,
scribble, write it down.
Identify this on your Venn
diagram before you proceed.
Did you get A?
If you negate a negation,
you get back the original.
That's very loosely,
two negatives make a positive, okay?
This is the idea.
And how do you verify this?
Well, let's look at
the compliment of the compliment.
Any omega in the compliment of the
compliment cannot be in the compliment.
But if it is not in the compliment
then it must be in the original set.
Therefore every omega in the compliment
of the compliment is in the original set,
and vice versa.
And therefore, the compliment
of the compliment is A itself.
With these three basic cooperations,
we can construct very,
very rich sets, and in fact, all set
theoretic operations can be reduced
to repeated operations involving unions,
intersections, and compliments.
Two specific such operations orca
often enough that they work taking
notice off and giving specific names
to and let's take a look at them next.
The first of these connotes a difference
operation, except of course,
unlike an ordinary numerical
difference of two numbers.
This is a set difference.
Sometimes it's written as A minus B.
But it's preferable to use a different
separator instead of a minus sign.
A minus sign is loaded, it connotes very,
very specific numerical
things in our brain.
So let's denote a set theoretic
difference, by a back slash.
So, an A back slash B,
in words we will say this as A minus B.
It stands for a set,
which is constructed from the constituent
subsets A and B as follows.
It consists of those
omegas which lie in A,
and at the same time, do not lie in B.
Now, notice we've constructed
a description which is linked by an and.
And that brings to mind immediately
the intersection operation
because that's what an intersection is,
it is a logical and.
This is equivalent of saying
I must be in A and not in B,
but not in B means that I'm in the
compliment of B and therefore A minus B
is just a short way of saying,
the intersection of A with B compliment.
Again, you've seen the little half moon,
which visually represents what's going on,
in this kind of set theoretic operation.
I don't know, is that a gibbous moon or
something like that.
Now, you understand immediately that this
kind of operation is not transitive.
You can't simply change the order.
The analogy is not perfect,
but just like we can't simply
swap the order of numerical objects
that you're subtracting from each other.
You also, in general cannot simply swap
sets in the order in which we
take set theoretic differences.
So here, as a sanity check,
verify the following.
What is a set, B minus A?
Iden, identify it on your Venn diagram.
Write down what it is in
terms of intersections.
And when you're ready, proceed.
Now, when you come back,
did you get A compliment intersection B?
And of course you realize we can get this
by simply interchanging the roles of A and
B on the definition of
the equation I have given you.
If you just swap the orders of A and
B, you'll get exactly B minus A.
Now, since A minus B and
B minus A are in general,
different, we can combine them to
make something which is symmetric in
terms of differences and
this is called a symmetric difference.
Again, for those of you who
are familiar with Boolean algebra,
this connotes a logical, exclusive or.
The symmetric difference of A and
B is denoted A with a little delta and
a B, a little triangle and a B, and
that stands for a set described
more robustly on the right.
It stands for
the collection of objects little omega,
which are precisely one of A and B.
So either omega is in A and not in B or
omega is in B and not in A.
At the moment we say or, we say oh yes,
that sounds like a union operation and
indeed, there's a union
lurking in the background.
Since omega has to be in precisely one of
A and B, it's got to be either in A, or
in B, but not in both.
If it is in A,
then it must be in A minus B.
If it is in B on the other hand,
then it must be in B minus A.
And either of these cases trigger the
exclusive or, the symmetric difference.
And therefore,
the symmetric difference between A and
B is a union of the set differences,
A minus B and B minus A.
If you want to think of it visually,
of course,
it is this conglomerate of elements with
the intersection excised from the middle.
Now these are the basic operations, the
ones you should really remember unions,
intersections, compliments, and
it is worth while thinking of the set
differences and
symmetric differences as well.
These crop up occasionally
in applications.
Write these down,
memorize the definitions.
These are one of the few things
you should hardwire in your minds.
And when you feel comfortable that you
understand what these concepts are, let's,
as a test case, simply go ahead and
do a test of concept.
