Now, this has got no particular value or
importance whatsoever,
other than in simply testing to see
that you understand the definitions.
Let's start with a universal set
consisting of the numbers one through ten.
They could connote anything you like.
The semantics are not relevent for
our purposes.
Suppose A is a set of four
elements I've shown you.
And let's suppose B is a set of
another four elements which I've also
shown you there.
Determine the various compliments,
the unions, the intersections,
the set differences in both directions and
the symmetric difference of all of these.
Write them down.
And when you're ready check the answers
against what I will show you before we
can proceed.
Well here are these various operations.
There are two kinds of complements they
could take, the complement of A or
the complement of B.
There's one union operation.
There's one intersection operation.
There are two kinds of set
differences A-B and B-A.
And there's one symmetric difference.
Verify that you've got these.
If you haven't naturally you need to go
back and look at the definition again and
make sure you understand this.
