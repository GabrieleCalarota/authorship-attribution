We are familiar with the rich and
wondrous tar field in the night skies.
Well, at least we were, in the days before
light pollution in our major cities.
On the right of your screen,
you see one of the glorious images
of the universe taken from
the Hubble space telescope.
The stars form pinpricks in space,
scattered richly, thickly, and
sometimes sparsely.
How are the stars distributed in space?
An approach to modeling is suggested by
a consideration of the Poisson process.
Now, let's now recall that we
constructed the Poisson process
with an arrival process in mind.
There was times arrow going to the right,
and
arrivals arrived at random points in time.
But if you will go back and
look at the way we defined the process,
you will discover that,
times arrow, the direction of time,
was in no ways critical to the way
we defined a probability model,
to try to capture this
kind of arrival process.
And indeed, the basic definition
of the Poisson process
could just as well have been
made in space instead of time.
And so we could deal.
In space with a Spatial Poisson process
in one dimension or two dimensions or
three dimensions.
For definiteness let's talk
about three dimensions.
Though, naturally questions of volume,
three dimensions become area in two and
become length in one.
Now, so, what we want to
do is find a proper abstraction of
the model of a Poisson process.
To capture a Spatial process
where points in space now connoting
the arrivals and time, but
of course arrivals is not the proper
word anymore where dealing with space.
We'll call these points
in space Poisson points.
Poisson points appear at a mean intensity
of alpha points per unit volume.
Into a dimensions, It'll be alpha
points one alpha points per unit less.
What should then categorize the
probability distribution for the process?
Well, naturally enough,
we begin by considering regions in space.
Let's say we consider some
region denoted abstractly by a.
A key element in the definition
of the Poisson process is
that the number of Poisson poin,
points in A should
in no wise depend upon the particular
geometric features of A.
But should depend solely
upon the volume of A.
Replace volume of course by area or
length if you have to or one dimension.
So, we require that in any
region A whose volume is say v,
the number of Poisson points is
trans-driven in that region and
that number is governed by
a Poisson distribution.
With a parameter, alpha time v.
Another way of saying this, is,
if you have a region of volume v.
The expected number of Poisson points
in it should be alpha times v.
Of course, this corresponds to a mean
arrival rate of alpha per unit of volume.
Of course,
this is not going to be enough, right?
This gives us a Poisson structure,
but once we have such a structure,
this gives us something analogous to
the independent increment property.
To wait, if one now looks at disjoint,
non-overlapping regions in space,.
Each of them per our basic assumption
is going to have a Poisson
distributed number of points.
The number of points across
these disjointed regions
must be independent trials.
And there you have it.
We know have a Spatial Poisson process
in one, two, or three dimensions.
Such processes are important in
modeling random scatter in space.
Of course,
we could imaging using such a process
to model the number of stars in a galaxy
or a certain quadrant in the night sky.
We can even search processes in two
dimensions to model noise in images.
For example, if a list has
ever seen an ultrasound image,
she will remark on how noisy and
grainy it appears.
It will see an image and
in the image you'll find specular
points of light there and there.
And a characterization of these
deformities, if you will,
these imperfections, is provided by
a two dimensional Poisson process.
Noise processes in two dimensions
are usually called speckle and
Poisson processes in two
dimensions provide natural avenues
to categorize speckle, or
noise, in such images.
The listener should
always bear in mind when
applying a mathematical
model to a physical setting.
As to whether the models, assumptions,
actually are in consonance
with the physical reality.
So, let's go back to
the distribution of star fields.
And ask, how good is it,
that a Poisson Spatial
process should we use the model for
such a system?
At heart here,
is the idea that we're treating Poisson
points as literal points in space.
But, of course, the less object and
say well a star's a rather massive object,
is it not.
The key here is to understand that,
yes, a star is large object,
using earthly standards of distance.
But on a stellar scale it is
actually a rather small object,
in the vast depths of interstellar space.
It could easily be viewed as being
approximated as a point in space.
In other words,
we issue formally the possibility's
of double stars, triple stars.
No, stars are simple,
singular, point objects.
What about the independence
characterization?
I would again listen to my object and
say well look.
We require that regions which are disjoint
have independent star formation processes,
but surely, if you have two regions
right next to each other and
you have star formation close to
the periphery of these regions,
then surely there will be
gravitational interactions, and again,
the answer here would be to
consider the immensity of space.
Perhaps the right way to think about
this is to think of units in space,
not in terms of let's say meters or
kilometers, even.
But in terms of say,
teledimensions as units of dimension.
Or perhaps even better,
galaxy wide dimensions.
Or perhaps even parsex, one light year
aside as a unit of interstellar space.
At such dimensions gravitation plays
a very small role because of the inverse
square law, and therefore again one
might have a reasonable guess that
an independent assumption might not be too
draconian assumption in such a setting.
As always the reader should
always check the bonaidades or
the mathematical model in
the particular physical circumstance.
