I should reiterate that while
the Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann statistics don't
apparently fit any known particle,
the theory is vibrant and rich.
It has contributed to a rich,
robust theory, a kinetic theory of gasses.
It has given meaning and a deep insight
into the feeling, the phenomenon,
of temperature.
So this is actually a huge
advance in physics as a whole.
But at the particulate level,
at the quantum mechanical level,
it apparently does not hold as advertised.
The next step in the understanding
of where to go from here
was provided by two other luminaries,
giants of the 20th century.
The first, Satyendra Nath Bose,
was an Indian physicist.
The second, Einstein, well, was Einstein.
Bose proposed a way of viewing
assemblages of photons,
quantized particles of light, and
figuring out what the assemblage would do.
The theory that he proposed
was not immediately popular.
In fact it was rejected at
the first general he sent it to.
But they found support with
the redoubtable Einstein.
Einstein realized that Bose's
ideas could also hold or
apply to assemblages of
larger elements like atoms.
And together, they published
a sequence of papers starting in 1924.
These papers articulated a model for
certain physical particles.
Now, what was the key insight?
Well, let's go back to our toy
example to see what Bose and
Einstein descend in the physical world.
So the setting is this.
We are thinking about the random placement
of a certain number of balls n in
the example n is 12, into a certain number
of urns r and in our example r is 4.
The question, the thought that came
across Bose's mind was the following.
What if the balls are not distinguishable?
Hm, this is strange.
We don't quite have an easy analog
of this in our practical experience.
For example, imagine tossing a coin twice.
Well, naturally, I know what the first
toss was and what the second toss was.
The experiment is equivalent to taking
a pair of coins and tossing them.
Of course, I know this coin
is separate from this coin.
And therefore, for that experiment,
the possible outcomes are for a number,
labeling for
example the coin on your right as coin 1,
the coin on your left as coin 2.
You have heads, heads tails,
tails tails, and tails heads.
But in Bose's view,
if the coins were indistinguishable,
then you could not discern a head and
a tail from a tail and a head.
So in this view,
you only have three possible outcomes.
A head, head, a head and
a tail, and a tail, tail.
It's as if you have a triangle
of outcomes an your experiment
is giving you one side of
the triangle at random.
Oh, this is strange,
okay how do we grapple around this and
in particular how do we figure out.
Occupancy configurations in this
kind of non intuitive setting.
Well, we adopt as a guiding
principle the sage
advice of the Hungarian
mathematician George Polya.
Who opined that in complex problems,
we could do worse than asking
the following very, very simple question.
What is the simplest version of
the problem that I do not yet
know how to solve?
Of course, in this case,
I've got too many balls or too many urns.
And so
I'd want to reduce the number of balls and
the number of urns to see if I
can discern essential features.
Well, how many balls should I have?
Well, one ball, well that is trivial so
maybe perhaps I should
start with two balls.
And how many urns?
Well, one or two urns appears trivial, so
perhaps we should start with three urns.
And so, we have a sanitized,
simpler setting.
Two indistinguishable,
indistinguishable balls and three urns.
And now I want to distribute
these balls in these urns.
Of course,
this problem is now easy to handle.
Let's go about stripping
it of its purest structure,
which is not essential to
the logical heart of the problem.
What is important about the urns?
Is it important that I
actually give you a, an urn?
No, that doesn't seem to
be critical to the problem?
It's our attached view of,
let's say, cells, rectangular in form,
are quite sufficient.
All I need is a place to put balls.
Is it important that I have floors and
ceilings for these cells?
Well, even that is not important.
All I need to know.
Is which urn is which.
And so, imagine the following
way of setting up the problem.
Stack up your urns from left to right.
While at the left end you have a wall,
this is the edge of your first end.
At the right end, you have a wall.
This is the edge of your last urn.
In between we have walls,
separators, or sticks.
And these sticks serve to
separate one urn from the other.
And now what do we do?
We toss the balls into the urns.
The example I've shown you is
where the first urn is empty,
the second urn has a ball,
the third urn has one ball.
And so, we are looking at the occupancy
configuration, zero, one, one.
In this model of Bose and
Einstein it makes little matter.
Whether the first ball has gone
into urn two or into urn three.
All that it matters is that the urns two
and three are occupied each with one ball.
The moment I understand this, now I can
start writing out all possibilities.
I'll pause for a moment and
let you play with this and
see whether you can write down all the
possible configurations that could result.
Now, we've had a chance to play with it.
Did you come up with
a representation like this?
Well, what have we done here?
The simplest way to do this and
the most efficient way is to be
very systematic in the way you go
about assigning balls to urns.
In other words,
do it in a lexicographic fashion?
One way of thinking about the assignment
is as follows, we have two balls.
One possibility is that
both balls go into one urn.
Now if that is the case we have
the situation that is seen on your left.
You have urns,
1 being occupied with 2 balls with
occupancy configuration 2, 0, 0.
Or Urn 2 with 2 balls occupancy
configuration 0, 2, 0.
Or Urn 3 with 2 balls,
occupancy configuration, 0, 0, 2.
Now we've exhausted all possibilities for
both balls going into a common urn.
We can now turn our attention to those
cases where no urn has a double occupancy.
But in this case we can
start by saying well,
what are those cases where
the first urn has single occupancy?
In which case, the remaining ball
has to go to either Urns 2 or 3.
Leading to the occupancy numbers 1,
1, 0 and 1, 0, 1 respectively.
At this point we've exhausted
all possibilities for
single occupancy or
double occupancy of the first urn.
Which means the first urn can now only
be empty as a last remaining case.
But now since double
occupancy is forbidden,
that brings us back to the example we
started with, the occupancy 0,1,1.
And now it is clear there are no
other cases, and so these,
this is the universe of possibilities.
Now we want to extract
from this simple example
key features which can generalize
to arbitrary structures.
So let's take a hard look at what
these images are telling us.
At the ends I've got these urn boundaries.
They are fixed.
Now the urns themselves
are metaphorical ends, and
remember they are infinitely distensible.
An urn can contain as
many balls as you wish.
Right?
And I denoted this in
the figures on your left by
showing urns which are big
enough to accommodate 2 balls.
So I just moved the barriers to
make sure I could put 2 balls in.
Good.
Now if I look from left to right
on your screen, what do you see?
I see that I have a succession
of balls and urn barriers.
Let's rephrase this.
The balls look like stones.
The urn barriers, the separators, look
like sticks, or if you like, 0s and 1s.
I've got a string of sticks and
stones in some order.
Each of the cases gives me
a distinct arrangement of sticks and
stones, 1s and 0s.
What appears to matter
are the positions that are available.
How many positions do I have?
Well, I've got 2 balls, 2 stones.
And how many sticks?
Well, there are 3 urns and therefore the
separators are 3 minus 1, or 2 in number.
So I have 2 sticks, 2 balls, 4 locations.
And our 6 possibilities
have covered all ways of
distributing those 2 balls
into those 4 locations.
Okay, this is our key insight, all right?
Let's capture everything together.
We've reduced the problem
of distributing our 2 balls
into our 3 urns into
the following consideration.
There are 2 identical stones,
balls, which are indistinguishable.
There are 3 minus 1, or
2 sticks which connote
cell barriers, urn walls, or separators.
Together, I have between the sticks and
the stones, 2 plus 2, or 4 locations.
And of those 4 locations,
I have to specify which
2 the sticks land in, and
which 2 the stones land in.
There are exactly 4 choose
2 ways of specifying.
For example, which locations
are occupied by the stones?
And of course, the remaining locations
must be occupied by the sticks.
Once we understand this key principle,
the generalization is very, very clear.
And we immediately write
down the general answer.
So now let's suppose we start with n
indistinguishable balls and r urns.
Arrange the urns from left to right.
Fix the end points.
How many separators?
How many sticks do I have?
1 less than the number of urns, r minus 1.
How many stones do I have?
Well, it's the number of balls, n.
How many locations do I have to
distribute my sticks and my stones?
n plus r minus 1.
Of these locations, you have to specify
which n are taken by the balls.
The remaining ones, of course, are taken
by the sticks, the urn boundaries.
And of course, you have a binomial
coefficient, n plus r minus 1 choose n.
We now have a complete description
of the number of ways in we
can distribute n indistinguishable
balls into r urns.
We now put everything together.
There is no reason to believe that any
one distribution is any more likely
than any other.
So we make an actual assumption
that these configurations,
these distributions
are all equally likely.
So now we have n plus r minus
1 choose n possible ways
of creating these
occupancy configurations.
The chosen occupancy configuration
k1 through kr is one of them.
And therefore, the chance of observing
that particular occupancy configuration
is a reciprocal of n
plus r minus 1 choose n.
Bear in mind again that these occupancy
numbers are not negative, and
they must inevitably add up to
the number of balls in the system.
The key here is that the balls
are indistinguishable.
Now, this is theory, this is nice.
This was published in 1924,
by Bose, and by Einstein.
But, is it real?
Okay.
What is the worth of such a theory?
Of course, the essential worth of a theory
is in its fit to observed reality.
And in this, this model turned
out to be hugely successful.
A wide range of elementary particles, and
composite particles, follow this law,
articulated by Bose and Einstein.
These particles are called bosons,
in honor of Satyendra Nath Bose.
The nomenclature was,
was created by Paul Dirac.
And bosons, for
those of who know a little physics, are
particles which have integer spin, right?
For the rest of us, what does this mean?
Well there's a wide range of elementary
particles which fit this model, right.
Common examples are photons,
the carriers of light.
The gauge bosons,
which are the carriers of force.
These include the gluons, which
mediate the strong nuclear force, and
the W and Z bosons, which mediate what
is called the weak nuclear force.
These are force carrying particles.
The Higgs-Boson.
This was a particle which was sportulated,
around the middle of the 1960s,
to be the particle which confers
mass as we observe it, 'Kay.
The existence of this particle is key for
20th century physics
to work as advertised.
And ever since it was postulated
in the 1960s, a massive particle
hunt was underway to try to determine
whether this particle actually existed.
And remarkably in 2013,
the Large Hadron Collider
in Geneva in Switzerland
physicists announced that,
that they had discovered this
elusive particle, the Higgs Boson.
Because of the fundamental
nature this particle,
sometimes called the God particle.
All these are examples of bosons,
fundamental particles which obey
the Bose Einstein statistical law.
Einstein observed that this kind of law
also applies to composite particles,
larger particles.
For example,
things like the helium for isotope.
And the carbon-12 atom.
These are examples of larger structures,
larger particles,
which obey this basic law.
At the heart,
the particles called bosons
have this principle in mind.
They are represented by
indistinguishable particles
distributed in a non interacting
fashion across possibly many urns.
You discern this kind of statistical
phenomena at the particulate, or
the quantum level.
Now a key element here is that these
particles are non interacting.
Photons, for example,
don't really interact with each other.
And, there are these particles can
comfortably occupy the same urn.
They are not snobbish or exclusive, so
many particles could land in one urn.
Now, this led Einstein to conjecture in
1924 that you could
have a state of nature.
Very, very strange state
of nature where if you cool
the system down to close to absolute zero,
that Bosons could end up
falling into a state which
was as comatose as possible,
as still as possible for
a quantum mechanical pa, particle.
Now, no quantum mechanical
particle is absolutely still.
It's got little twitches and
it moves, it moves, eh.
That's the nature of the beast, okay.
This is one of the strange features of
a quantum mechanical view of the world.
That there's randomness everywhere.
There's twitchiness everywhere.
But if you try to eliminate
a twitchyness as much as possible,
close to absolute zero.
Then Einstein realized that
this kind of mortal gave
rise to this new form of matter,
something that today we call
a Bose Einstein Condensate.
Where the particles at the quantum
level all sit together and form a stew
where macroscopically this, this soup
will exhibit quantum kinds of behavior.
Now this is where the worth of
a theory comes into evidence.
It makes predictions.
Could this actually be realized.
Well the hunt from 1954 took 70
long years, 71 to be precise.
But in 1995 physicist
California constructed
a Bose-Einstein condensate using Rubidium
atoms cooled to near absolute zero.
This was a triumphant
vindication of the theory
which had been a century in the making.
And since then, other Bose-Einstein
condensates have been constructed and
observed, as late as the year 2010.
A Bose-Einstein condensate of photons,
the fabric of light, was constructed.
This is a marvelous story.
Okay?
And it actually ends up in a nobel prize
winning story for these discoveries.
But it is not a complete story.
Just a couple of years after Bose and
Einstein published their paper,
physicists realized that these phenomena
described by the Bose-Einstein statistics
don't apply to certain
other common particles.
This will be the next part and
the final part of our story.
