Tableau 12,
a potpourri of titillating applications.
Part 2, Rare events and
a probabilistic sieve.
Pondering existence, le probleme des
rencontres, the coupon collector.
This is a final, concluding,
dangerous bend segment for this course.
Let me take you back to
a view of the subject
that we began with at
the start of this tableau.
Much of a progression was
geared toward ending up
with the basic limit laws which
are central to the ethereal probability.
At heart the limit laws say that
they deal with typical events.
They talk about concentration and
this notion of centrality.
And out of these considerations emerged
the magnificent normal distribution.
When we move to another domain
then the limit laws have
a rather different character.
And this is a setting of rare events,
extrema, exceedances.
In these cases,
as we saw the poisson distribution
emerged rather serendipitously, magically,
from nowhere it seemed by consideration
of rarity in Bernoulli trials.
We shall see these lectures that this in
fact is part of a much more pervasive and
gentle paradigm.
A paradigm which we shall
call the Poisson paradigm.
And this governs not typical events but
rare events and
this will be the subject of Ida Tarbell
