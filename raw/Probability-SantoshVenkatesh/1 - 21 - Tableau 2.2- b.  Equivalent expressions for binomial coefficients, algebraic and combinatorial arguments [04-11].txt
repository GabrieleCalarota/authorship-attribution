All right.
Now that we have a right understanding
of the falling factorial in
terms of ordinary factorials,
let us turn to the binomial.
Now, let us begin with a ratio.
Look at the ratio of n factorial to
k factorial of n minus k factorial.
Let's begin by grouping terms,
pulling out the term k
factorial in the denominator and
expanding out to see what we get.
Now the moment we pull out k
factorial from the denominator,
what remains we recognize is exactly
our old friend, n to the k falling.
And therefore,
their expression in the middle is exactly
n to the k falling over k factorial.
But we pause, we reflect and
say, we have seen this before.
In fact, this is exactly the binomial
coefficient, n choose k.
And so we've discovered a new
representation for n choose k.
N choose k may also be written
in a equal formulation,
as the ratio of n factorial to the product
of k factorial and n minus k factorial.
But we shouldn't rest on our.
The form in the middle,
such as another decomposition.
What if we pull out the term
in minus k factorial?
And now let's see what happens as
our expansion moves to your right.
If you pull out the term,
n minus k factorial in the denominator.
What remains is n
factorial over k factorial.
And we recognize from the previous slide,
that this is just another name for
n to the n minus k falling.
And so
this expression becomes n to the n minus k
falling divided by n minus k factorial.
And we recognize in here and
neither binomial coefficient.
It is exactly n choose n minus k.
And we've discovered
a beautiful binomial identity.
N choose k may be a return in
terms of falling factorials.
If it was written in terms
of ratios of factorials,
it may be written in terms of quite
another binomial coefficient.
Now this kind of identity and
this ability to move freely between
different representations turns out to be
form an analytical point of
view extraordinarily useful.
Now, we derive these formulate
by just algebraic manipulation.
Where does this actually lead to?
Can we think of this in a more,
oh, visual way?
Is such an identity transparent?
Is it obvious?
Does it fall into a lapse, if we just
look at the problem holistically?
Indeed, it does.
Incombinatorial settings, it is frequently
the case that algebraic computations.
May be replaced by purely
combinatorial logical arguments.
Let us illustrate this in this setting.
So let's start with our binomial identity,
n choose k equal to n choose n minus k.
Now recall that the binomial
coefficient arose.
In categorizing the number of
different sub-populations,
we can engender by sampling
from a larger population.
So imagine that we've got
a population of size n.
We select k from this population.
This is what you will see
on your left-hand side.
We've selected k out of
these population of size n.
There are n choose k ways of doing this.
Now the moment you specify k,
that means you've left out n minus
k members of the population.
Specifying those that
are selected is equivalent to
specifying those that are not selected.
And therefore,
it becomes obvious that in fact n choose k
must be exactly n choose n minus k.
Here's a purely combinatorial argument for
this kind of identity.
