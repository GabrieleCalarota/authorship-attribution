Now, having an inclusion-exclusion
formula in hand,
let's see if we can tweak
this a little bit more.
See if we can extract some identities.
This is a dangerous bend segment,
a bonus lecture.
Sample it if time and discretion allow.
Okay.
We have an identity for the probability
of the union of two events.
What can we say about the probability
of the union of three events?
Of course, in terms of conjunctions.
Now, we'll have many things to play with.
They are all probabilities of A, B, and C.
The intersection probabilities,
A intersection B,
A intersection C, B intersection C.
And also the probability of
the intersection of all three of them.
In settings like this, if at all possible,
one should draw a picture,
in the sage adviser, George Polya.
And so let's draw a picture.
A generic collection of three events,
A, B, and C,
have got complicated interrelationship and
sort of shown in the figure.
Now, we want to deal with
the union of the three events.
Now, that's complicated.
An idea of cause is to try to decompose
it in terms of, of disjoint elements,
and in such a way that we can
utilize the inclusion-exclusion
formula we've already discovered.
All right.
So let's talk with a decomposition of
A union B union C in terms of first,
A union B together with C.
Now, we've got two events.
A union B and C.
And we can apply the inclusion-exclusion
formula to those two events.
In this case now,
A union B takes the place of A.
And C takes the place of B, and
we've got an inclusion-exclusion formula.
A sum of two raw probabilities
minus an intersection probability.
Let's look at the elements
on the right in turn.
Well, the probability of A union B,
we have already discovered
an inclusion-exclusion formula,
so we just write it down.
This next term is just a probability of C,
there's nothing to discover there.
And then we have a probability
of A union B intersected with C.
Leverage the, the distributed property
of intersections of unions and
rewrite the event as the event
A intersection C union B intersection C.
And now, in the round brackets,
we've got two events, A intersection C and
B intersection C.
And we have the union.
It's alright now again for
another application of the basic
inclusion-exclusion formula, with now,
A intersection C taking the place of A,
and B intersection C
taking the place of B.
We write the formula down.
Okay, at the very end,
we've got the intersection of two objects.
But we realize that if you intersect
C with itself, you just get C.
And therefore,
we now have all the pieces needed to write
down a formula for the probability
of the union of three objects.
We write it down in terms
of a sum of three objects,
a difference of three objects,
and a sum of a single object.
And we look at this carefully,
pictorially,
you realize that what were really
doing is a game following through
on the principle of inclusion and
exclusion.
We first add the elements A, B and C.
We found we've got too much.
The stuff in the middle of
the intersection is over-counted, right?
And each element is
over-counted exactly once.
So, you subtract the three
elements in the middle.
But the moment you do that,
then the intersection of all three of
them is accounted for three times.
Once in A, once in B, once in C.
And subtracted three times,
once in A to section B,
once in A to section C, and
once in B to section C.
Hence there, we have to add it back in
to make the calculation fair and just.
It's a little bit like thinking about,
let's say, the way a pendulum might swing.
Like, let go, and it overshoots and
so it comes back, and it undershoots.
It goes up, it overshoots.
It undershoots.
It overshoots.
It undershoots.
And then finally, it settles down.
And this is exactly
the process we're following.
An overshoot-undershoot phenomenon.
Each time we overshoot,
we take away something from it, and
we find we've undershot.
So we go back and add some more elements.
And eventually,
we get exactly where we need to get to.
To listener, we can well see how one
can expand on such a formulation and
talk about the probability
of union of say n e, events.
And I'll let you have at it.
