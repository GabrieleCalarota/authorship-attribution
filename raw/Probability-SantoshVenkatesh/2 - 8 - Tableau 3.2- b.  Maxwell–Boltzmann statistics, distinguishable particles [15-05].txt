We begin our analysis with the classical
model for particulate description.
It has got two famous
names attached to it.
James Clerk Maxwell was perhaps,
the greatest physicist,
mathematician of the 19th century.
In many ways, you can think of Maxwell
as the connector between Newton,
on the one hand, and
Einstein on the other.
Maxwell's perhaps most
famously remembered for
being the father of electromagnetic
theory in his epochal publication
in 1873, of the way
electromagnetic forces interacted.
These are now called Maxwell's equations.
But Maxwell had wide other interests,
as well.
In particular,
he contributed to this classical theory
of how particles were distributed.
Maxwell I'll say,
was a dilettante in many other areas.
He famously, was the first person
to examine the rings of Saturn, and
conclude that the rings must
be made of up of many, many,
many tiny bodies, and
were not just solid rings.
He was also a poet, and
he published famously in Victorian
light verse, but we digress.
His collaborator in these ideas was very
different in personality from Maxwell.
This was Ludwig Boltzmann.
Was famously attached to the idea of
an articulation of a, the statistical
nature of the second law of thermodynamics
that disorder entropy increases.
Boltzmann, towards the end
of the 19th century,
pushed an atomic view of physics.
This was not popular at that time.
But the idea is he was proposing,
like Maxwell,
proposed a statistical distribution of
atoms to explain physical phenomena.
Boltzmann, sadly,
took his own life in 1906.
He was an intense man,
suffered bouts of depression,
and sadly he died just a few years before
his theories were dramatically confirmed.
In experiments done by J.B. Parre in
Paris to measure Avogadro's number.
But the main thrust of
the Maxwell-Boltzmann ideas
was essentially, combinatorial.
And so, here's the setting.
Recall we have a setting,
where we have n balls.
In this case I've shown you 12 balls, and
our urns for definiteness,
let us consider 4 urns.
And now I've dispensed with the idea
of a physical urn as an object,
which can receive balls, again from
a purely metaphorical point of view.
All that matters are these
objects which are called balls,
which I'm going to distribute into these
receptacles that I shall call urns.
So now I have 12 balls and 4 urns.
Now, suppose one is intrited, interested
in a particular occupancy configuration.
In annotation 4, 2, 0, 6.
Now, what does this mean?
It means, we are looking for distributions
of these balls into these urns in such
a fashion that the first
urn collects 4 balls.
The second urn collects two balls,
the third urn is empty, and
the fourth urn contains
the remaining balls, six in number.
Okay, here's an occupancy configuration.
In how many ways can this be done?
Okay, let's pause for a moment,
and think about this.
In a setting like this, it is convenient
to begin by asking what is
the first step in the process?
And the first step is well, we want to
distribute 4 balls into the first urn.
Let's go ahead and do this.
Now here is a particular distribution
of four balls into the the first urn.
But this could assuredly be done in many,
many different ways.
How many ways?
Well, there are 12 balls, and
you've gotta choose any 4, so
there are 12 choose 4 ways of
distributing 4 balls into the first urn.
With the 4 balls in the first urn,
we now turn attention to
the occupancy of the second urn.
2 balls have to go there but 4 balls
have already been removed from the pool.
So we have 12 minus 4, or 8 balls left
of those 2 go into the second urn.
How many ways can this be done?
Well, eight choose two ways, or
in a more clear way 12
minus 4 choose 2 ways.
Excellent, now at this point we've
removed six balls from the population.
We have 12 minus six balls left,
or six balls left, of those,
none go into the third urn.
Of course,
there's only one way to do this.
Nothing goes in there.
But to identify this logically,
what we are saying is that we
have 12 minus six, or six balls.
And none go into the third urn, this
can be done in six, two's, zero values.
And now we come to the last Urn.
At this point we have six balls residual,
and all of them go into the last urn.
This can be done of course,
in only one way, or
spelling it out in 6, 2,
6 ways which is exactly one.
Good.
And now we observe we've got this
flock of covey of binomial coefficients
fluttering onto the screen.
And the moment you write this down oh,
it does look formidable doesn't it.
But of course, naturally we will
want to try to simplify this.
And so
we begin by writing down explicitly,
what each of these binomial
coefficients really is?
Pause and do this.
Good.
Now you've written down what these
binomial coefficients mean, and
now we've got a long string
of ratios of factorials.
It does look intimidating but pause, take
a good look at what you've written down.
Do you see any patterns?
Of course, you do.
You realize that terms cancel
in numerator, and denominator.
An eight factorial
cancels the numerator and
denominator, and
two pairs of six factorials also cancel.
Which means the expression simplifies.
Recall that zero factorial is one so
the last zero factorial I'm
going to replace by one.
And now I've got an expression,
which is too large, but it clarifies.
The expression has the factorial of
the number of balls in the numerator, and
in the denominator a product of
the factorials of the occupancy numbers.
It couldn't get much simpler, could it?
Now that we've built a right understanding
of a simple implementation of the schema.
Let's properly generalize, and
come up with what an expression
should be in the abstract setting.
Where we have n balls, and r urns.
And the process will be exactly,
eh, as we saw in this example.
If we start with n balls of
those k1 go into the first urn.
How many ways can this be done?
Of course, n chose k1 ways.
The moment k1 balls have
been place in the first urn.
Now, there are n minus k1 balls remaining.
Of those, k2 have to go to the second urn.
And that's this can be done in n minus k1,
choose k2 ways.
At this point,
we have n minus k1 minus k2 balls left.
Of those, k3 have to go the third urn,
and to proceeding in this fashion.
By the time we get to the last urn,
from the number of balls,
we've taken away the sum of the first
r minus one occupancy numbers.
Of course, if you think about it,
you'll realize this just means
you have k sub r balls left.
And they all have to go to the last urn.
This can be done exactly one way,
which is the last big binomial
coefficient on the screen.
Well, a long expression, the next step
of course, is to try to simplify it.
So, we write down explicitly, what each
of these binomial coefficients is?
Pause, and write them down.
As before,
you observe that factorials cancel,
one after the other,
in numerator and denominator.
And the entire expression
simplifies beautifully, again.
To 1, where you have a ratio.
The factorial of the number of balls in
the numerator, and in the denominator,
a product of the factorial
of the occupancy numbers.
It couldn't get much simpler.
Here now is the expression for
the number of different ways.
In which a distribution
of n balls into r urns
could engender a given occupancy
configuration k1 through kr.
The question of course,
now is how many ways can I distribute
the balls in the urns in the first place?
Oh, but this is easy.
If I think of arranging the balls from
left to right, ball one, ball two,
ball three, ball 12, ball n, and
identify, which urn each ball went into.
Then we have one particular distribution
of the balls, and the urns.
But this means that we have
an ordered sample of size n.
Selected from the urns where
the sampling is with replacement
multiple balls can occupy an urn?
Of course, we know the answer to this.
It is inevitably r to the power n.
And now we've got a complete story.
Okay, and this is the classical model for
the distribution of balls into urns,
classical particles into states.
And these lead to what are now called
the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics,
named after James Clark Maxwell and
Ludwig Boltzmann.
The chances that in a random
deployment of n balls into r urns,
the probability that particular
occupancy configuration, k1 through kr,
is seen, is given by the ratio
of the number of ways in which this
occupancy configuration could be realized,
divided by the total number of ways
of distributing balls in r urns.
Of course, bare in mind here that these
occupancy numbers must be non-negative and
they must add to the total number
of particles in the system.
Now this looks beautiful,
elegant, and a complete story of
how particles in nature might
distribute across states.
There's just one small fly in
the ointment, and it is this.
Investigations in the early
part of the 20th century
showed that there are no known
physical particles which
satisfy this completely
natural distribution.
Let me repeat that again.
There are no known physical
particles which obey
this completely natural
physical distribution.
This is remarkable.
The probabilist William Feller
wryly remarked that apparently,
particles in nature do not come
equipped with human common sense.
What could have gone wrong?
The model is superbly correct.
I mean, you take a bunch of particles.
You can throw them out, and
they distribute randomly.
And the count is inevitably given by the
Maxwell-Boltzmann formula on your screen.
Why on Earth do particles not obey this
completely, obviously correct description?
This points out the perils
in applying clean ideas,
ideas which appear to have
a logical immediacy, a correctness.
And assuming, making the leap
to believing that nature must,
in fact, conform to our idea
of mathematical cleanliness.
In this case,
nature at the quantum particulate level,
apparently does not like
this way of common sense.
And by the early part of the 20th century,
it became clear that this classical idea
was shipping water.
It could not hold, as a description
of reality that is being examined.
Something new had to take its place.
This will be the content of our
next sliver side, all right.
I should not let it go however,
by imagining that this
idea of Maxwell-Boltzmann
was should just be immediately
confined to the nearest trash can.
These ideas had enormous impact.
And in the realm of
the description of a macroscopic
view of gasses of the world,
they have enormous accuracy.
Where this kind of description falters
is at the individual quantum mechanical,
particulate level.
There particles behave in strange and
wondrous ways, and
we shall come to that next.
