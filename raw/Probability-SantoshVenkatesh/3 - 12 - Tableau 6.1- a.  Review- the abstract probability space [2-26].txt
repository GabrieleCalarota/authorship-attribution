Tableau Six.
Probabilities in simple settings.
Part One: Discrete spaces.
Now this far in our development,
we began by considering chance
experiments in simple settings.
And out of these,
build an axiomatic framework for
a mathematical theory of chance.
The framework rests upon a conceptual
gedanken chance experiment and
a collection of idealized
outcomes for such an experiment.
The set comprised of all
conceivable outcomes is in
the language of Robert Formosa's,
what we call the sample space.
Our first task is to identify
the conceptual sample
space under consideration.
Next, the evets of interest to us
are subsets of this sample space.
The events form an algebra
in which we have the analogues, the
set-theoretic analogues of addition and
multiplication.
Finally,
we have the idea of a probability measure.
This is a set function,
which assigns to events probabilities.
Now probability
measure is subject to
three fundamental axioms.
The axiom of positivity, probability,
mirroring chance is always non-negative.
The axiom of
normalization.
The entire sample space corresponding to
a certain event has got probability one.
And finally,
the important axiom of additivity.
Now, at this point,
the student could well ask.
Well, this is all well and good, but
probability measure as a set function
looks like a horribly complicated object.
How does one in practice design,
allocate a probability
measure to a problem at hand?
As always in this kind of setting,
we turn to our experience with chance and
commonplace settings.
