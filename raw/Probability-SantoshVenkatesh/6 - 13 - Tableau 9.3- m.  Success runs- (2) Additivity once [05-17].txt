Of course, we could go on from here and
compute f7, u7,
f7, f8, u8, s8, and so on.
And the listener will have realized
that the probabilities f n and
u n will actually coincide all
the way up till trial number 9.
And that is because through
the first nine trials,
it is only possible to have a single
success run of length 5 at most.
One can't have two success runs of
length 5 in the first nine trials.
So the first place where f and u start to
differ, start to diverge, is at trial 10.
Of course,
the s n probabilities are more complex.
They have to take into account not only
a success run at a given point, but
also possibly previous success runs.
Doing it by hand and working your
way forward does not seem to appeal.
This is looking to become
algebraically cumbrous.
And so it would be wise for
us to step back and
take a look at the larger picture,
see what we can deduce about the problem.
And of course,
a key principle is immediately suggested,
that of additivity, partitioning
the problem into a proper piece.
So let's start by deconstructing
the occurrence of success runs again.
Suppose we are looking at trial n and
we're asking, what is the chance s
n that there is a success run of
length 5 at or before the nth trial?
A key principle immediately suggests
itself, and that is the following.
If there is a success run at or
before the nth trial, then manifestly
there must be a first success run
somewhere earlier in the sequence.
This is a necessary and
sufficient condition for
there to be a sucess run at or
before the nth trial.
And that immediately suggests to
us a partition for the problem.
Recall the event at hand of
interest to us is the even S n that
there is a success run of length 5 at or
before the nth trial.
Well, for this to happen, there was
either a first success run at trial 1,
or a first success run at trial 2,
or at trial 3, 4, 5, and so
forth, or a first success run at trial n.
In other words, S sub n is the union
of F1, F2, F3 through F n.
Now, the student will have realized that
I'm belaboring what appears to be
a simple point, but this is key.
There also appears to be a certain
amount of redundancy here,
because F1 is empty,
F2 is an empty set, so is F3, so is F4.
One cannot have a success run occurring
at or before the first, second,
third, or fourth trials.
But it is unwise to unnecessarily
complicate our notation.
We may as well start with the first trial,
keeping in mind eventually
that the probabilities for
the first four trials are going to vanish
quietly like the snows of yesteryear.
So, let's say then that
we have a partition.
S n is the union of n disjoint events F1,
F2, through F n.
Of course the principle of additivity
promptly rides to the rescue.
The probability of S n, then,
must be the sum of the attendant
probabilities of F1, F2, through F n.
Or in our compact notation,
s n must be equal to f1 plus f2 plus f3,
through f n.
We spent a fair amount of time on what,
in retrospect, will appear fairly simple.
But the idea of linking a success
run somewhere in a sequence
to first success runs is
not immediately obvious.
And it is this key idea that
allows us to open up the problem.
And therefore it is worth spending time
on it, relishing it, understanding it.
What we've got here is a slogan.
We are interested in the probability s n.
And what our additivity principle
tells us, what our partition tells us,
is, if we know the first
success run probabilities f1,
f2, f3, and so on,
then we can deduce the probabilities
s n of a success run somewhere at or
before that point.
This is our first slogan, and we're going
to, this is of course a political age, so
we're going to build it in
a sequence of slogans, and
eventually we'll get to
where we want to get to.
But this is a good starting point.
We have decomposed a problem
into bite sized pieces.
Our questions now are, well,
what can we say about the f's?
This comes up next.
