The Poisson process,
a dangerous bend, optional segment.
Thinking of the Poisson in
terms of arrivals leads to
a very natural time varying phenomenon.
So imagine that starting time at time
zero and progressing to the right.
We see points arriving, roughly in
accordance with the Poisson distribution.
The number of arrivals then,
in a certain amount of time should
constitute an arrival process.
This is what we want to try to model.
A Poisson process, let's call it N, as a
function of a continuous time parameter t,
ranging over the positive half line, of
a given rate, also called the intensity.
Let's use a Greek letter alpha for this.
Alpha represents in this kind of picture,
the number of arrivals
per second on average.
So, a Poisson process of rate or
intensity of
is governed by a particular
probabilistic structure.
Let's begin by looking at
how we interpret N of t.
Pick any point in time t, and
look at the time period from zero to t.
Then, there are a certain number
of arrivals in that time period.
Of course,
this constitutes a chance variable.
So we think of the N of t as a number
of variables up till that time, t.
Now, if you tell me what the number of
arrivals is at all points in time, t, then
in any given interval we can determine how
many arrivals were there in that interval.
Let's abuse notation just a little
to write down our understanding of
what happens inside an interval.
So, let us pick a given interval.
Let's say, from s to t.
Now, the number of arrivals in,
in this interval,
let's call this N of the interval s to t,
is exactly,
of course,
the total number of arrivals up to t,
for which you take away
the number of arrivals up to s.
Good.
Naturally, we will want these basic chance
variables to have a Poisson formulation.
So this comes up next.
What is a key characteristic
of a Poisson process?
First, we require that in any interval,
let's say s comma t,
where s and t are arbitrary positive
real numbers, s being less than t.
The number of arrivals is
a chance variable N of s comma t,
which is Poisson distributed
with a parameter alpha
times the length of an interval,
alpha times t minus s.
Let's pause to make sure we
understand what's going on here.
Remember, the expectation of
a Poisson variable is its parameter.
So if you tell me that in
an interval of length t minus s,
the Poisson variable has got
parameter alpha times t minus s.
Then, on a per length basis, the number
of expected number of arrivals is alpha.
Well, that's exactly how we had, what he
had in mind when he talked about alpha as
the rate of arrivals,
the intensity of the process.
Okay.
But this is not going to be enough.
In addition, we demand that,
if we look at non-overlapping intervals,
disjoint intervals,
then the arrivals in each of them
constitute independent trials.
In other words, prior arrivals do
not affect subsequent arrivals.
So this is the underlying independence
characterization of the Poisson process.
Set a time varying,
chance dependent function, N of t,
which has got this
probabilistic infrastructure.
In any interval, the number of
arrivals is a chance variable.
It is Poisson
with a parameter which is proportional
to the length of the interval.
And with a property that
the arrivals in disjoint,
non-overlapping intervals,
are independent.
Such a process is called
a Poisson process.
Of course in the back of our mind we have
in mind applications like the following.
People arriving in a queue
over a certain period of time.
The number of arrivals as we track them
follows a Poisson process very roughly.
Packets arriving at an internet router.
Traffic arriving at an intersection.
If one were to visualize this,
we can plot N of t versus time,
and then we get a graph in time.
What kind of graph would this be?
Well N of t is a number, and
therefore, we want to start at zero.
And every time there's an arrival,
N of t will increment by one unit.
Such a process is sometimes
called a counting process.
And so,
here are examples of N of t generated,
when the rate of, I've chosen for
visualization purposes to be 1.
And here are three kinds of curves
that arose by random generations
of random arrival points.
Now, we should pause and see if we can
flesh out the statistical structure,
the probabilistic structure
a little bit more.
Of course, this is much more complex
than anything we've considered hitherto.
Here, we have not just one or two or
a finite number of chance variables,
but chance variables
over an entire continuum.
And then, among other things,
we should ask,
are things defined in a consistent way?
So let's take a look of
these processes again and
tease out some more
probabilistic intuition.
So again, the key characteristics of
a Poisson process is that in any interval,
the number of arrivals is
Poisson with a parameter with
an expectation proportional to
the length of the interval.
And furthermore,
arrivals in non overlapping
intervals are independent trials.
So in particular, if you give
me an interval from say s to t,
the number of arrivals in that interval,
N of s of t,
in compact notation is itself
a Poisson variable with a mean,
with an expectation alpha times t minus s.
If we set s equal to zero, then we
are dealing with interval from zero to t,
and we're looking at the number
of arrivals from zero to t.
But that, of course, is what we
call the original process, N of t.
And therefore, N of t itself for
any given t is Poisson with
a parameter alpha times t.
If the mean arrival rate is alpha arrivals
per second, then in a window of time t,
the number of arrivals on average
is going to be alpha times t.
Now let's take an interval from 0 to t,
and see how the independent
increment process is turned into a count.
So take an interval from 0 to t,
and let's say we
partition it into n sub
intervals call zero t sub 0.
And then think of a sequence of values t1,
t2, t3, culminating in tn, which is t.
So this appears on your screen.
Now, what you've done is taken
an integral from 0 to t and
partitioned it into n
nonoverlapping subintervals.
T0 to t1, t1 to t2,
t2 to t3, and so forth.
How many arrivals are there from 0 to t?
Well, that is exactly N of t, right?
Well the number of variables in,
in the whole interval is precisely the sum
of the arrivals in each of these
non-overlapping sub-intervals,
and therefore, we have an identity.
The number of arrivals from 0 to t is
the number of arrivals in the first
sub-interval, added to the number of
arrivals in the second sub-interval,
and so on down to the nth sub-interval.
Now, pause for a moment, all right.
On the left of the expression, you've got
a variable which we know by the definition
of the Poisson process should be
Poisson with parameter alpha times t.
But we have an identity.
On the right we have
a sum of n quantities.
Each of those quantities
represents a Poisson variable,
a Poisson number of arrivals
in a given sub interval.
What do, what do we know about them.
Well, they are individually Poisson.
Each of them has got a parameter
proportional to the length
of the sum interval.
So, N of t0 t1 is Poisson with
parameter alpha times t1 minus t0.
N of t1 t2 is Poisson with parameter
alpha times t2 minus t1, and so on.
But we know more.
The independent increment
property posits that each
of these is an independent trial.
These are independent variables.
And so, what we're doing is to stitch
together a number of arrivals up to t.
We are adding independent
Poisson variables.
Ah-ha, but our slogan for
the stability of the Poisson tells
us that if we add an independent Poisson
variables, the result is Poisson,
and its parameter is the sum
of the individual parameters.
Let's quickly check.
Identify lambda 1 with alpha
times t1 minus t naught.
Identify lambda 2 with alpha
times t2 minus t1, and so on.
And now we've got a long expression.
I look at this, and
I realize, oh, wait a minute.
This thing telescopes beautifully.
For example, you t1 from,
contributed by lambda 1.
And you have minus t1
contributed lambda 2.
They cancel.
T2 contributed by lambda 2 and
minus t2 contributed by lambda 3.
They cancel.
In fact, all subsequent terms cancel,
leaving only the bookend terms, t0 and tn.
And therefore,
this entire sum of the Poisson parameters
becomes simply an alpha
times tn minus t naught.
But recall, tn was t, t naught is 0, and
therefore, this is exactly alpha times t.
Exactly as we should because
the result of adding these
independent Poisson streams is exactly
the number of arrivals up to t.
And that should be Poisson
with mean alpha times t.
This independent stability
property of the Poisson,
then, is at the heart
of the Poisson process.
At this stage, it looks promising.
We've now got a mechanism for
describing congestion phenomena,
traffic phenomena, queues.
But the listener might well quibble and
say,
this sounds very good, but oh,
deary me, this is really complex.
And she might well ask, well look, what
is the probability space in a quest in?
What is the underlying sample space?
It's not at all clear in the way
we've described it so far.
So our next dangerous bend,
optional segment comes to the question of,
given a Poisson process,
what is the underlying probability space,
the sample space that
fuels such a process?
And this will lead us to the discovery
of an exponential distribution and
various distributions connected with
the theory of waiting times and queues.
This comes up next.
