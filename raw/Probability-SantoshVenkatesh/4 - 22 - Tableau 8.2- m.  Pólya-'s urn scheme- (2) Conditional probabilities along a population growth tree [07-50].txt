Imagine that we have as a root of a tree
a population of two flavors, r and s.
R red, s black.
This tree now grows with arrivals and
each growth,
each branch in the tree,
adds a to the population.
A branch to the left says that a red ball
was drawn, and a red balls were added.
So in your first step,
you move left, a red branch.
And a population moves with a mix of r and
s, to a mix of r plus a and s.
A first black ball drawn,
a seditionist met,
means the population moves
from r s to r and s plus a.
There are now s plus
a black balls in the bin.
And now you move in red and
black steps, left and
right, as I've shown you in the tree.
The vertices of this tree
represent the population mix,
depending upon the particular sequence
of balls' colors that were drawn.
Okay.
Now, this is, at minimum, it is evocative.
It brings a picture to mind.
It allows us to see pathways to analysis,
our next step indubitably is to
try to put together probabilities.
A priori probabilities, a posteriori
probabilities, identify events.
So let's take a look, all right.
Idea here is, our basic question was, if
we observe two red balls in the second and
third draws, what is the chance
the first ball drawn was a red.
In other words, we're moving along
the left branch of the tree.
A red ball is drawn, a second red ball
is drawn, a third red ball is drawn.
This tells us that we need to
somehow figure out how we're
moving along the edges of this tree.
Now, now let's build this forth.
So here is our population growth tree.
On the vertices I'm going to put down
the population distributions that are each
step depending upon
the history of transitions.
On the edges I'm going to put weights.
And these weights are going to
represent conditional probabilities and
in a very natural sense in this problem,
forward conditional probabilities or
transition probabilities.
We are now ready to set
up the probability space.
What is the sample space for this problem?
What is uncertain in this experiment?
A little introspection will tell us,
that what is uncertain is really
the color of the balls drawn at the first,
second, third, fourth, and so on steps.
Each time I can tell you
which color ball was drawn.
Then I'll know exactly which
pathway I'm taking along this tree.
And therefore,
the sample point can be thought of
as sequences of reds and blacks.
And all possible such sequences
constitute the sample space.
What are the events of interest?
Now, naturally enough,
we identify the events of interest with
the color of a ball drawn at a given step.
Let us say the kth step, r sub k denotes
the event that the kth ball drawn was red.
So r1 represents the event that
the first ball drawn was red.
R sub 2 was the event that the second
ball drawn is red, and these all
constitute in the second tier of the tree,
the two red steps moving to your left.
And those two vertices, r plus 2a,
and, s, and, r plus a and
s, both represent a second red ball drawn.
R3, represents a third red ball drawn, and
it is the four leftward transitions,
or the third stage of the tree.
These are naturally events of interest,
of course, they're complements.
What are the complements of Rk,
well let's call it Bk.
It represents the fact that
the kth ball drawn was black.
We observe that these events Rk create
a natural partition of the space.
On the first step, I'll have to either
get a red ball or a black ball.
I can't get built, and so
they naturally partition the space.
Excellent, now we've
got the events at hand.
We now want an implicit
probability measure.
And let's build this one step at a time.
First, start at the root and
move to a red module.
The population has now become
r plus a red balls s balls.
The probability of drawing a red ball
initially, naturally, is proportional to
the number of red balls in the bin,
and therefore, is r over r plus s.
Now given that you've got
a red ball initially,
in the first red ball, what is the chance
that we draw a second red ball?
In other words we move along
the left edge of the tree again.
We're not talking about
a conditional probability.
We're starting with the premise that
we obtained a red ball initially.
And therefore, with the population of
r plus a red balls and s black balls,
the chance of drawing a red ball is
r plus a over the total population,
r plus s plus a.
And working in this fashion,
we can move onto the next step.
The probability of
drawing a third red ball,
given that the first two drawn
balls were red, is now again,
written on the edge, it's r plus 2a,
divided by r plus s plus 2a.
Now we can readily see
how we can fill out other
transition probabilities
along these lines.
Pause for a minute and evaluate
the three conditional probabilities
I've asked you to on the screen.
Well, have you tried to
make your way through this?
Well, let's walk our way,
through these probabilities.
First, start of the route,
you draw a black ball first,
you meet a seditionist first.
The chance of that, well, there are s
black balls out of a total population of
r plus s, and the probability therefore is
written on that edge is s over r plus s.
Now, given that you got a black ball,
rim another population makes his r and
s plus a, what are the chance
that you now obtain a red ball?
Well, this is the condition of
probability, of R2 given B1, and
again just by looking at the population
mix you have r and s plus a, the chance of
getting a read is r over r plus s plus a,
and again you see that on the edge.
Given that you have a black ball initially
followed by a red ball at the second draw,
what is the chance of a red
ball on the next draw?
Hm.
Well, the population mix now, given that
you have drawn already a black ball and
a red ball, is r plus a and s plus a.
The chance of drawing a red ball now is
now r plus a divided by r plus s plus 2a.
And now you see how easy this is.
You can systematically
populate all the edges, here,
with forward transition conditional
probabilities as I've shown here.
You should pause for a bit and
see if we agree with the numbers
I've thrown up there for you.
