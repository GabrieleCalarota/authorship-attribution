We are now equipped to compute
probabilities of genotypes
in the filial generation.
The conditional probabilities
point the way, and
they point to a natural partition
of the probability space.
Pause for a moment and
think about, how would you set up.
A, an expression by partitioning
the probability space.
A little introspection might have
told you that it would be natural,
completely natural, to partition this
space based upon who the parents were.
And that immediately opens up the problem
and gives us the answer in one fell swoop,
and all will be over by the shouting,
and just a smidgen of algebra.
So, let's begin.
What are the chances of obtaining a child,
whose genotype is normal and homozygous.
In other words, two upper case A's.
Let us call this probability U Prime.
So, in other words,
U Prime is a probability that
the child's genotype
is two upper case A's.
We naturally condition on each
possibility for the parental genotypes.
Both parents are normal and homozygous.
The father is normal homozygous,
the mother is a carrier, heterozygous.
The father is a carrier,
the mother is normal and homozygous,
both parents are heterozygous.
This is total probability,
the magic of additivity.
Once you find the right
way to break up a problem,
it becomes transparent, even trite.
Now, the expression took more
time to write than to imagine.
We could just as well have obtained this
by looking at the figure on
the upper right of your screen.
You want to get the child genotype
being normal and homozygous.
Look up all the arrows that enter it,
there are four possibilities, and
sum over those four possibilities.
The weight on an arrow is the conditional
probability, multiply by the probability
of the A priori probability of
the parental genotype and sum.
This is all there is to it.
And in this case, of course we
would just look at our tables and
write these numbers down if you wish.
And we get an algebraic expression.
This is simple.
The denominator is a square of 1 minus W.
It's common to all the terms we collected,
collected numerator.
Write it down.
And now, recognize that in the numerator,
I've got a whole square.
U square plus twice uv plus v square is
inevitably u plus v the whole squared.
Though, in the intermediate step I've
got a square in the numerator and
a square in the denominator.
And it'll be really convenient, trust me,
to re-write it as simply u plus v
over one minus w, the whole squared.
A square relationship has emerged
from this algebraic mess.
Let's hold on to that for
a moment, all right,
it's going to turn out to be particularly
informative and illuminating and useful,
but right now, we just got a square and
for our purposes we've done the problem.
Given the ratios u to 2v to w for
the genotypes in the parental genera,
generation; given that the infected
individuals cannot mate;
given random selection and random mating.
The probability that the child's
genotype is normal and
homozygous is simply u plus v divided
by 1 minus w, the whole squared.
Okay.
So forsake it.
If nothing else,
it's got the virtue of being simple.
What about the probability that
a child ends up being a carrier,
the child has a heterozygous genotype?
Okay, to be consistent,
we're going to call the probability for
the heterozygous case in the filial
generation, twice v with a prime,
to distinguish it from the corresponding
situation in the parental genotypes.
So twice v prime is the probability that
the child has got a heterozygous genotype.
And we do exactly the same thing.
We're going to condition based
upon the four possibilities for
the parental genotypes.
And when we do that,
we realize that the case where both
parents are normal and
homozygous cannot contribute.
Because in that case,
neither parent can proffer a lethal gene.
And now we've got another
algebraic system, a little simple,
the factor one minus w the whole squared
is common in the denominator in each of
the fractions,
two is common in the denominator,
put everything together and
we've got another simple expression.
And it will, again, be convenient,
trust me, to realize that,
in the numerator, the factor two is
common, so it can factor it out.
The factor v is common,
it can factor that out.
And we'll separate it into twice
a product of two fractions.
U plus v over one minus w,
and v over one minus w.
The last case follows
exactly the same pattern.
But it's even simpler.
Because the child can have the lethal
genotype if and only if both parents
are heterozygous and
both parents proffer the lethal gene.
In this case, three of the possibilities
vanish leaving simply the last one.
Write it down, and we find again,
oh, there's a beautiful square.
We get v divided by 1 minus w,
the whole square.
At this point, you see all
the probability has been exhausted, but
the story has not been exhausted, right?
The results are elegant and
simple enough to suggest
that there might be some information
that is hiding in these patterns.
Let's try to look at this more carefully.
And, the way we're going to do this is
by setting up the parental
genotypes on one hand.
And the filial generation on the other,
and
looking at the probability numbers as
you go from one generation to the next.
Here's what we know.
In the parental generation,
on the left of your screen,
we start with an original population
where males and females have genotypes,
normal homozygous, heterozygous or lethal.
In the proportions u twice v w.
If you want for
definite distinct 60%, 30% and 10%.
Of that subgroup, lowercase a,
lowercase a genotype individuals
are forbidden from mating, sadly.
And so, in the mating sub-population
on the parental side,
the normal homozygous individuals appear
in proportion u divided by 1 minus w.
And the heterozygous individuals appear
in the proportion twice v over 1 minus w.
And if we look at the genes
these individuals proffer then,
individuals in the mating population,
in the parental pop, generation proffer
the dominant normal gene uppercase A.
With a probability p.
Given by u plus v over 1 minus w and
proffered a lethal gene,
a little a with probability
q given by v over 1 minus w.
Now, we'll use the same notation for
the filial generation on
the right of your screen.
In the filial generation,
the genotypes appear in proportions,
and we'll use the letters u, two v and
w again, with primes on them now
to remind ourselves that we're
dealing with the next generation.
When that generation mates,
then again, lethally infected
individuals cannot mate, and the remaining
individuals normal homozygous and
heterozygous making the proportions
u prime over 1 minus w prime and
twice v prime over 1 minus w prime.
And finally, in that mating
subgroup in the filial generation,
the, dominant and the lethal genes appear
in the proportion's p prime and q prime.
Exactly as before, now,
the whole point of exercise is that
the probabilities on the right
are conferred by the probabilities on
the left, by the relations in
the middle of your screen.
This is what we've discovered,
this is what total probability gave us.
It looks simple enough, but further
simplifications are immediately at hand.
Take a good look at this claim.
Does anything jump out at you?
If you looked at the lower
left of your screen,
you'll realize that the probabilities
p and q with the parental generation,
appear to have the same
form as the expressions for
the filial genotype
probabilities in the middle.
And indeed, we notice,
quite serendipitously,
these beautifully elegant results.
The normal homozygous probability for
a child is simply p squared.
The square of the probability,
or the proportion
of the normal gene offered,
during in the mating population.
The percentage of the population,
which is heterozygous in the filial
generation twice v prime,
or at least expected proportion of this
population the probability of getting
a heterozygous child is twice p q.
And the probably of getting
a sadly infected child,
w prime, is simply q squared.
All this is a remarkable and
beautiful, and elegant simplification.
And this is going to lead
to performed consequences.
So, let's now step back and
ask the following basic question.
Recall that the lethal gene,
lethal a is in
the parental mating
population with proportion q.
It is in the filial generation's mating
population with proportion q prime,
of course,
q prime is related to v prime and
w prime, which in turn is related to u,
v, and w.
Well, what is that relation?
Well, let's write this down.
So, q prime is v prime
over 1 minus w prime.
But, twice we v prime is twice p q.
And therefore,
v prime is just p times q and
w prime is q squared, so,
we get p, q over 1 minus q squared.
And an elemental factorization will
tell you that 1 minus q squared in
the denominator is 1
minus q times 1 plus q.
Very well.
But we realize, wait a minute,
that p plus q is 1 and
therefore, 1 minus q is the same as p.
If you cancel 1 minus q
the denominator with p the numerator,
that leaves you a very elegant and
simple result.
You could hardly ask for more.
The fraction or
the expected fraction if you will of
the lethal gene in the mating population
in the filial generation is given by
the ratio of the expected fraction
of the lethal gene in the mating
population of the parental
generation divided by 1 plus q.
A little rejiggery will
make it even simpler.
Simply, take the ratios,
take the reciprocals of both sides.
So, if you look at 1 over q prime,
on the left hand side.
That is the same as saying,
1 plus q over q.
Which is the same as saying,
1 over q plus 1.
Or, in words,
we can put it very succinctly.
The reciprocal of the lethal
gene in the mating population
in the filial generation,
is given by the reciprocal
of the proportion of the lethal gene
in the Pendle population plus 1.
