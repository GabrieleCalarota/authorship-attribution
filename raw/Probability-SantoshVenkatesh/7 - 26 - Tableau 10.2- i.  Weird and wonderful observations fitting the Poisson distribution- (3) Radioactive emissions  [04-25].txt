The discovery of radioactive emissions
at the end of the 19th century and
the early part of the 20th century
ushered in a brand new era
in human history, an era fraught
with possibility and danger.
There were immediate consequences.
It signalled the existence of a hitherto
unsuspected vast energy source.
An immediate consequence of that discovery
was that it pushed back
the age of the earth.
Now, to put this in context, we should
realize that through the end of the 19th
century, the best estimates we had for the
age of the earth came from thermodynamics.
Where viewing the earth
as an inert cooling body,
Lord Kelvin had made
calculations which suggested
that the earth should be
about 100 million years old.
Later calculations downgraded that
further to about 50 million years.
That sounds like a very vast time period,
but
part of Kelvin's thinking was that,
over a period of that magnitude,
no known chemical reaction can be
kept in place over periods of tens or
hundreds of millions of years.
And therefore, the proper model would be,
apparently, that the earth was initially
formed as a molten body and
then gradually inertly cooled in time.
Calculations from the heat equations then
give us estimates of somewhere between 50
million and 100 million years.
This kind of time period is much too
short for the evolutionary processes
that Charles Darwins',
Origins of the Species, demanded.
With the discovery of radioactivity,
all of that changed.
Suddenly a brand new energy
source had been discovered.
And an energy source which could
sustain an, a reaction for
millions and
hundreds of millions of years.
And with that discovery, suddenly
we now had tools to argue that the earth
was much older than had been anticipated.
And currently, our best estimates for
the age of the earth to
about 4.5 billion years.
And so, quite remarkably,
the discovery of radioactive emissions
gave strong reenforcement to
Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection
from a completely unexpected direction.
Of course there were going to
be more troubling developments,
some acutely troubling and
some very promising.
But this is going to take some time.
Now, here's an experiment which
was reported by Rutherford,
Geiger, and Bateman in 1910.
In this experiment,
they likely doped a film of polonium and
watched it emit these alpha
particles at intervals of
one-eight of a minute for
2,608 successive intervals.
And they counted over this entire period,
10,097 alpha particles emitted.
We immediately recognize an opportunity
for a Poisson approximation.
What is lambda here?
Well, over the entire period of
observation, there are 10,097 particles.
There are 2,608 intervals, and therefore,
lambda is the ratio of the two quantities.
It's about 4, it's about 3.87.
Here are the data reported by Rutherford,
Geiger, and Bateman.
And we look at the number of intervals
where there were no particles emitted,
one particle, two particle, and so
on through 15 and more particles.
And you'll observe them in this table.
If we compare these with the expected
Poisson values, which is,
take the corresponding Poisson probability
of observing so many particles.
Corresponding to parameter lambda,
about 3.87,
multiplied by the number of intervals
will give you the expected number of
intervals with that many emissions.
And even a cursory glance shows
remarkable agreement between
the observed frequency and
the modeling frequency.
