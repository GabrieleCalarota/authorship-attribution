A word on the background that'll be a
requisite to fully absorb these lectures.
With all its sumptuous background,
historical context and narratives,
we will be dealing fundamentally with
a mathematical theory of chance.
Not a subjective or
qualitative view of the subject.
And accordingly,
a student will need a modicum of
mathematical preparation to be able to
fully get the most out of these lectures.
Not an alarming amount to be sure.
The preparation that is requisite
is approximately equaled to
a semester of calculus.
Something along the lines of
what a student might see on a,
in a first year at college.
Or perhaps,
in an Advanced Placement course, or
in an International Baccalaureate program.
More concretely, a student should need
comfort with mathematical notation and
mathematical abstractions
to describe concepts.
A student should be familiar
with the ideas of variables.
For example,
using the ubiquitous n to represent
a generic natural number or an integer.
Or the letter x to represent
a generic real number.
We will occasionally use other
variants on the tea, on the theme.
For example, letters like i, j, k,
l, m, and n can represent integers.
Letters like r, s, t, u, v, w, x,
y, z may represent real numbers.
But of course generically,
long tradition has conditioned us to
thinking of integers as n,
real numbers as x.
A student will need exposure to the idea
of a function of a real variable.
In Euler's notation,
we write these as f of x.
We think of x as an independent variable,
an abscissa,
and f of x,
the function takes values as an ordinate.
And we are familiar with the graphs
of elementary functions.
A student should understand and be exposed
to the properties of the basic functions.
Linear functions, quadratics,
exponentials znd their simple properties.
A student should have exposure
to sequences of real numbers and
their limits.
And elementary series,
sums finite or countably infinite,
of real numbers, convergent or divergent.
So, this is the scope of the mathematical
background that a student should have.
Of course, the more mathematics
they have in their background,
the more mathematical maturity as it were,
the better.
But this is the minimum amount you
should have if you really want to
absorb these lectures as we go through.
The differential and
integral calculus make the appearances in
these lectures only in
selected bonus materials.
Which are not essential for
the grasping of the main elements
that I'm going to unfold for you.
Now with all this for background,
a student will also need some
elements that are typically
encountered in high school.
And these are denoted,
where they appear in
these lectures by this particular sign,
that has appeared on screen.
To denote something where you need
will work in your background.
The elements you'll need are twofold.
The elementary theory of counting and
the elementary theory of sets.
The theory of counting, we need to
understand how to sample, with and
without replacement,
from families, from collections.
The ideas of factorials and
monomial coefficients.
From the naive, or
the elementary theory of sets,
we need to understand notations for sets.
Basic set operations, unions,
intersections, complements and
set differences.
And simple rules for massaging
set identities, de Morgan's Laws.
These lectures are available
as part of the preview.
And for a student who is
unfamiliar with these ideas.
Or has had these topics and
they are sequestered in the dim recess of
her memory and she would like a refresher.
You will find these lectures
available as part of the preview.
