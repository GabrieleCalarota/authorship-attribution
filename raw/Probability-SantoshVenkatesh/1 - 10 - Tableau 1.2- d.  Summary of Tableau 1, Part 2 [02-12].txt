Let me summarize then,
the main lessons from our first tableau.
Non-intuitive behavior crops up
even in elementary settings where
one does not anticipate surprises.
For instance, as we have seen,
in a prolonged sequence of coin tosses,
it is not at all unlikely that
one observes a success run, or
a failure run for that matter.
Already the need for
a formal theory, a formal foundation,
on which you can erect this edifice,
is manifest.
These results are not just
purely academic curiosities.
They apply to a variety of settings.
For instance, results of runs
can be used to postulate or
put forward a principled
statistical test for
hypotheses such as the existence
of a hot hand in sports.
The probabilist
William Feller has lamented,
we may fairly lament that intuitive
probability is insufficient for
scientific purposes, but
it is a historical fact.
What then,
is the worth of a formal theory?
From the mathematical point of view,
the worth of a theory is the rich,
unexpected developments
that arise out of it.
And from the applications point of view,
the worth of the theory is in the fit of
the theory to models and observed data.
In these, the modern theory of
probability has been wildly successful.
In the next lecture, we will begin with
a review of basic combinatorial elements,
the basic art of counting.
