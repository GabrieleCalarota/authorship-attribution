So accordingly,
let us take a good hard look at the sum.
It is clear that we're going to have to
add terms of the kind k times b of k.
And a little algebra ahead of
time will smooth a pathway.
So accordingly,
let's identify a typical term in the sum,
k times the binomial probability
associated with k successes.
Write out down the binomial probability,
and
now we've got a simple algebraic
equation to deal with.
If we want to simplify it,
we should begin by taking the binomial
coefficient and writing it out.
In terms of a falling factorial,
and a factorial in the denominator.
Now we're getting a messy looking,
more complex expression.
We are trying to identify
the rule of k here.
Remember, k is what I'm
going to be adding over.
k is going to range between 0 and
n in the sum.
I notice that the factor k multiplying
the expression is in the numerator and
is a k factorial in the denominator,
which means I can cancel k in
the numerator and denominator.
Let us go ahead and directly do so.
And now, we've got a slightly,
ever so slightly simpler expression.
With k minus 1 factorial
in the denominator.
This is an algebraic excursus and
it's not clear that
anyone could really love that expression,
perhaps not even its mother.
But, if we want to make
progress in simplifying it,
we should look for some themes here.
And a clue is pointed to us
by the appearance of k minus 1
factorial in the denominator.
That is beginning to be suggestive
of another binomial coefficient.
This time involving k minus 1.
Let us see if we can massage the
expression to make this dependence on k
minus 1 evident.
First, in the numerator of the fraction,
we have k terms.
Pick the first one, let's say n,
and move it out of the fraction.
That will leave us k minus
1 terms in the numerator.
You have a product of k minus 1 terms,
each one less than the preceding
starting at n minus 1 and
ending at n minus 1,
minus k minus 1 plus 1 or in other words,
ending at n minus k plus 1.
We make a little progress.
Our next step is to observe that
the power of p can be decomposed
into a product of p with
p to the power k minus 1.
Again, a k minus 1 emerges.
Take the extra factor p and
move it out of the faction to the left.
Now what do we have?
Well, let's simplify it.
We pulled a term n and a term p out of
the expression, keep it on the left and
hold it.
And then what remains is a fraction,
a falling factorial in the numerator
starting at n minus 1.
And proceeding for k minus 1 terms.
There it is.
And replace the last term, n minus k
plus 1, by simply subtracting 1 and
adding 1 back into the term to make
the dependence on n minus 1 and
k minus 1 manifest.
Then I've got p to the power k minus 1.
And finally, a power of q which I can
decompose by again subtracting 1 and
adding 1.
And writing it as q to the power
n minus 1 minus k minus 1.
That looks horribly complex but
you realize that the expression,
the fraction is just another
binomial coefficient.
It is just n minus 1 choose k minus 1.
And, immediately,
the term multiplying n times p becomes
identified with yet
another binomial probability.
And here is a key binomial identity.
On the left, I have a generic integer k
times the binomial probability b of k.
Now let us identify the rules and
the parameters n and p explicitly.
Say on the left,
we have k times b sub n of k and p.
Think of k as a free variable.
N and p are your fixed parameters.
On the right, I have n times p
times the binomial probability
corresponding to k minus 1
accumulated successes in
n minus 1 tosses of your coin,
with success probability p.
And now, we've got a beautiful identity.
On the left, we have a default
experiment involving n tosses of a coin.
On the right, we have connected
it to an experiment involving
n minus 1 tosses of a coin.
It's not clear that this,
these kinds of algebraic manipulations
have taken us much further forward.
But a little experience will tell us
that we've done something very useful.
We have taken a multiplying factor,
k on the left, and
replaced it effectively by something which
doesn't depend upon the free variable
by a constant, n times p, on the right.
This is going to pay us big dividends.
But, before we jump ahead of ourselves.
This kind of general algebraic
formula is valid for
all choices of k and
all choices of the parameters, n and p.
We can get a whole host of other formulae,
simply by replacing k and
n by different values on
both sides of the equation.
So for instance,
if I replace n by n minus 1,
and k by k minus 1,
I get an equivalent formula.
Just conduct the replacements on both
sides, and now I've got an expression on
the left involving a default experiment
involving n 1 minus 1 tosses of a coin.
And on the right,
a connection to an experiment involving
n minus 2 tosses of that coin.
We already have enough here to go
ahead and compute the expectation.
But this algebraic maneuvering is
suggesting that there are other
possibilities.
So let's take a little detour what
a view to a latent necessity,
and pick up one more identity.
