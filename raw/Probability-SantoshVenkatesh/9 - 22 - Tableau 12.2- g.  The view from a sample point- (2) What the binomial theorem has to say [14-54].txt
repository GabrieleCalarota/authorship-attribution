Let's take these three
cases one at a time.
Remember, here is how we have positioned
ourselves, fix any k and hold it.
It's fixed but arbitrary,
a number between say, zero and n.
Now select an omega.
This sample point is in a certain
of number of these events,
between zero and n.
Let's say, there's l of A events.
Now we're going to look at
the various cases for l.
Remember, the sample point is now fixed.
Suppose l is less than k,
your sample point is in fewer
than k of the given events.
If that is the case, then manifestly,
the sum of the indicators is l,
which is given to be less
than k it is instance.
Such an omega cannot possibly
reside in the event on the left.
And therefore,
such an omega will contribute nothing to
the probability of the left-hand side.
What about the alternating
sum on the right?
Well, the first stem of
the sum reflects Sk,
which is the sum of all the k-wise
intersection probabilities.
Now remember,
the k's bigger than l in this case.
Pick any k-wise intersection
through the events A1 through An.
At best, that k-wise
intersection will contain all l
of those events, where omega resides.
But there are still going to be further
events in that intersection in which
omega does not reside.
They've given it, l is less than k.
And therefore,
any k-wise intersection of these
events cannot contain that given omega.
And therefore, omega will contribute
nothing to the entire term Sk and
for even stronger reasons, a for sure A.
Omega can contribute nothing to Sk plus 1.
Omega can contribute nothing
to Sk plus 2 and so forth.
And therefore, such an omega contributes
nothing to the entire right-hand side.
And so we're happy if l is less than k,
then any sample point which resides in
l of these events will contribute nothing
to the left and nothing to the right.
What if l is exactly equal to k?
Then on the left, it is clear.
Because now the sum is k and therefore,
the event is automatically triggered.
If l is equal to k, if omega resides
in precisely k of the events,
then omega contributes once to
the event on the left-hand side.
But what about the right?
Now, on the right, since omega
resides in exactly k events only,
no k plus 1 intersection
can contain omega.
No k plus 2 intersection can
contain omega and so on.
And therefore,
none of the terms Sk plus 1, Sk plus 2 and
so on, on the right will
contribute to the right-hand side.
What about the term Sk?
Well, since omega is in
k designated events,
precisely the one intersection comprised
of those k events will contain omega.
And none of the other k wise
interactions will contain omega.
And therefore, the chosen omega will
contribute exactly once to the term Sk and
will contribute nothing to
any of the other terms.
Well, in front of Sk,
we have a k choose k.
And therefore, the chosen omega
will contribute k choose k times
1 times to the entire right-hand side,
but k choose k is 1.
And therefore, if l is equal to k,
then omega will contribute once
to the left, once to the right.
And again, we're in good shape.
What if l is bigger than k?
And now this is the one case where some
algebraic digging is going to be required.
Well, if l is bigger than k,
on the left it is easy,
because the sum is bigger than l,
which is k.
And therefore, such an omega cannot reside
in the event on the left-hand side.
What about the right-hand side?
Now this is going to require
a little bit of thought.
If more than l terms are pulled
out on the right-hand side,
then any k plus j-wise intersection.
Where k plus j exceeds l,
cannot possibly contain that omega.
Remember, omega is an l.
So, if you choose more than l events,
then omega cannot reside in
their intersection, which tells
us that on the right-hand side,
we can only get contributions from the
terms Sk, Sk plus 1, Sk plus 2 through Sl.
Remember, l is no bigger than k.
And we will not get any contributions
from the terms Sl plus 1,
Sl plus 2 and so forth for
that chosen omega.
So let's then pick a generic term,
which this omega will contribute to.
So let's pick a term,
let's say, Sk plus j.
J now can only run between zero and
l minus k.
So that we're looking
at the terms between,
we have a k-wise intersection all
the way up to an l-wise intersection.
So let's take a look at
the a term Sk plus j.
When you are looking at Sk plus j,
remember k plus j now is going to be
smaller than l, at most it is equal to l.
We're going to look at a k
plus j-wise intersection.
In such a case, the only terms
that'll contribute is if every
term in that intersection is one of
the events that omega resides in.
How many possibilities are there?
Well, there are l possibilities for
selecting events that omega resides in,
out of which I want to select k plus j.
Let's stitch it all together.
For the generic k plus jth term.
There are l choose k plus j-wise
of selecting k plus j events all
containing omega and all these will
contribute to the term Sk plus j,
each of these will contribute
once to that term.
In front of this term, I've got
a binomial coefficient, which says,
k plus j choose k.
And in front of that,
I've got a minus one to the power j.
And now I'm going to sum over the range,
j running from zero thru l minus k.
This doesn't look like zero or does it?
Well, now we're going to
have to do some exploration.
What can you say about such an alternating
sum of binomial coefficients?
Let's begin by taking
a look at the sum ands,
so we are going to start building
a combinatorial identity.
The key element in a sum and
is the product of two binomial
coefficients, k plus j choose
k times l choose k plus j.
Let's write out these
binomial coefficients.
The first one gives you
a ratio of factorials,
k plus j factorial divided
by k factorial j factorial.
And a second binomial coefficient,
gives you another ratio of factorials.
That's l factorial divided
by k plus j factorial and
then a term, l minus k minus j factorial.
We stare at this and say, well,
clearly, there are terms,
k plus j factorial in both numerator and
denominator.
Let's promptly, cancel them.
And now we've got what looks like
a slightly compact set of fractions.
Take a good hard look at these fractions.
Do they remind you of anything?
Think about it for a moment and
then restart the lecture.
On concentration, if you said,
these individuals fractions remind me
of other binomial coefficients,
then you are indeed on the right track.
Let's construct new binomial
coefficients by multiplying and
dividing by l minus k factorial.
Remember, we are dealing with
a setting where l is bigger than k.
Also, far so good.
I've got, I've done no violence to
the identity on the right-hand side.
But now, I notice that the first fraction
is identically a binomial coefficient and
so is the second fraction.
And so we've discovered that
binomial combinatorial identity,
k plus j choose k times
l choose k plus j is
exactly l choose k times
l minus k choose j.
This looks like just a trite, massaging
and a rewriting and I've got a product of
the binomial coefficient to the left and
I've got another product of the binomial
coefficient to the right and it's not
clear to us that we've gone any further.
Has this actually improved matters?
Yes, indeed it has.
The key is this.
On the left, the term j,
which is the index for the sum,
appears in both binomial coefficients.
On the right,
it is sequestered in one of them.
Let's promptly put this
observation to good use.
Our sum, the number of terms
contributed by the chosen
omega to the right hand side
of the inclusion-exclusion
formula can be rewritten as follows.
Replace k plus j choose k
times l choose k plus j by
the identity we have just discovered.
Observe that the term l choose k does
not depend upon j as a constant,
as far as this summation is concerned.
It can slide out of it's summation.
Now take a look at what is left behind
in the ruins of it's summation.
Does this ring a bell?
Is there a faint atavistic
tug to your memory?
If this reminded you of the binomial
theorem, you are on the right track.
Remember, what does
the binomial theorem say?
It says something about powers of sums.
And a particular specialization of this,
1 plus x to sum into the power
m can be written in as
a sum of binomial coefficients
time powers of x.
Now compare the generic form
of the binomial theorem with
the expression on the right-hand
side of the sum we are looking at.
If we identify m with l minus k,
that looks like a binomial sum.
Well, what is playing the role of x?
Halted by observation, it is minus 1.
And so, immediately, we can write
down the sum on the right as a power.
We get the right-hand side is
equal to l choose k times 1 plus,
your x is a minus 1.
So 1 plus minus 1,
the whole to the power l minus k.
But of course, 1 plus minus 1 is exactly
the same as 1 minus 1, which is 0.
And since l is bigger than k, you have
zero to some positive power, you get zero.
And therefore, the entire right-hand
side devolves beautifully into zero.
We've discovered
a combinatorial identity and
we can promptly put this to good use
in the setting we were analyzing.
So remember, the question now
was when l is bigger than k,
how many terms did the chosen omega
contribute to on the right-hand side
of your inclusion-exclusion sum?
And now we can answer this.
Precisely, nothing.
This is beautiful.
Let's now takes talk of what we've done.
Select any k and hold it.
Pick a particular sample point, an omega,
arbitrarily from the collection
of sample points.
Now we're going to take this omega and
follow its trail, see what it is doing.
This omega resides in a set of
numbers in the events A1 through An.
If omega resides in fewer
than k of the events,
it will contribute nothing to the left or
to the right.
If omega resides in more than k of
these events, it will contribute,
as we've just discovered, nothing to
the left and nothing to the right.
The only time omega contributes is when
omega isn't precisely k of these events.
And in which case, it contributes
once to the left-hand side and
in fair and just fashion,
once to the right-hand side.
This is true for every selection of omega.
And in consequence,
we discovered the validity
of the inclusion-exclusion theorem.
When you look back at this,
you'll say, well,
I had to do some combinatorial massaging.
But the key to the exercise was
the magician's exhortation,
pick a card, any card.
Pick a sample point,
any sample point and follow its trail.
The student could,
should get used to doing this.
This turns out to be a very powerful,
general way of approaching probabilistic
problems, especially the advanced theory.
If nothing else, it'll have
a salutary benefit of firmly fixing
the underlying sample space of
the problem firmly in your head.
And of course, this is the very
first thing you should have done.
What is a sample space?
Pick a sample point,
then follow its trail.
So we now have a firm result,
a result which tells us something
about a number of occurrences.
Cast in rather mysterious
formulation on the right-hand side
in terms of intersection probabilities for
these events.
Where does this turn out to be useful?
Well, this will be next.
