Now let's take this intuition and
move on into another setting where
we might have some intuition and in
a commonplace setting where, which could
well be the setting for a parlor game.
Here is the question.
Suppose you have
an assemblage of 23 people.
What are the chances that at least
two of them share a common birthday?
Pause the lecture, think about it, and
see if you have an instinctive answer.
At this time, do not do an analysis.
We'll come to that in a moment.
But what do your instincts tell you?
What is your estimate?
Do you think it's likely?
Do you think it's unlikely?
Now, if I were doing this in front of
a real classroom, I could actually do
the experiment, and I frequently do in
class by asking individual students,
recite your birthdays and if any of you
have a coincidence, let us all know.
But albeit a live audience in one physical
location, let's do an analysis like so.
This is a setting, and
this is called the birthday para, paradox.
We built up some intuition
in combinatorial settings
where we could model problems
using balls and urns.
And this is another problem which is rife,
ready for such a, an approach.
Let's assemble the individuals
from left to right, one, two,
three up till 23, okay?
Imagine they're all
seated in front of you.
Now, one could do this problem for
23 individuals, but
it is much more satisfactory to do it for
an arbitrary assemblage of individuals.
So, let's imagine that we
have an algebraic variable
representing a fixed but
unspecified number of individuals.
Naturally enough,
we will call such an assemblage of size n.
Why n?
Because, of course, it is inconceivable
that I call an integer anything else.
Long tradition and custom has inured
us to calling integer variables n.
So let us suppose that
there are n individuals.
And each individual has a birthday
spread out through a year.
And let us for definiteness assume
that a year has got exactly 365 days.
I know you'll immediately
have an objection.
You'll say, oh well,
what about leap years?
Oh here's where we come
to the crux of modeling.
Yes, in fact,
every four years we hit a leap year.
And now we have 366 days of the year, and
some individuals will happen to be born,
for example, on February 29th.
But the idea of a leap year in
a setting of this size is going to make
a very small change in various
chances we calc, calculate.
But it's going to add enormously to the
complications we'll have to take care of.
And so, as a first modelling approach,
we make the default assumption
that we do not have leap years, and
we just start with a year with 365 days.
And now we have a setting
where each individual
takes one of 365 values as their birthday.
Naturally enough, we'll assume a random
sampling from the days of the year so
that each individual's birthday is equally
likely to be any of
the 365 days of the year.
Now this in itself is
not strictly accurate.
If you look at human populations,
especially in the temperate regions,
you'll find that birthdays are more
concentrated in certain parts of
the year for various climatic reasons.
But again, this is a second-order effect.
And this only gets in the way of
understanding what is going on.
If, for nothing else, if we assume
that we have random sampling and
that is equally likely, we are going
to get a conservative estimate for
the chance of a birthday coincidence.
So, let's simplify further.
We have n individuals.
Each individual can have one
of 365 days as a birthday.
And we assume random sampling
where every birthday is a priori
assumed to have equal probability.
An outcome of this experiment
is a string of n digits.
And this sequence of n digits
represents days of the year.
Each one is one of 365 days.
If we think of the individuals as balls,
the days of the year as urns,
what we're specifying is an ordered
sample of size n drawn from
365 distinguished urns.
And, of course,
by the basic principles of counting,
we know that the number of
different sequences for
birthdays we can get
is 365 to the power n.
This is sampling with replacement.
The days could in principle repeat.
Out of these 365 to the power
of n possibilities,
which possibilities result
in birthday coincidences?
As in de Mere's dice problem,
what if we consider
the obverse of this event,
the complement of this event,
which is the event that no
two birthday's coincide.
If that is the case, then we are provided
as an outcome a string of n digits,
each one taking values between,
say, 1 and 365,
with the property that no
two digits can be the same.
But this then corresponds to
an ordered sample of size n drawn
from a population of size 365,
the days of the year,
where sampling is without replacement.
And again, an elementary principle
of counting tells us that
there are precisely 365 to the n falling
possibilities for such a sequence.
Remember the falling factorial notation.
365 to the n falling stands for
a product of n terms starting at 365 with
each succeeding term one
less than the previous term.
Good, and now for the chances of not
getting a coincidence in birthdays,
should be 365 to the n falling divided
by 365 to the n because naturally,
we are assuming random sampling,
all days of the year being equally likely.
The chance, therefore,
that there is a coincidence that two or
more birthdays coincide
should be 1 minus this ratio,
1 minus 365 to the n falling
divided by 365 to the n.
Of course, this only depends on
the number of people in the assemblage.
Let's identify that, give it a name,
call it little p of n,
the probability that an n individuals
will find a coincidence of birthdays.
Of course, this varies within.
So we, we could very quickly
see what this behaves like
by tabulating representative values.
And here's what I provide for you.
So let's say n runs from 5 and
10, 15, 23, and so on up.
And that is in the first column.
And the second column tells you what
the value p of n computes to be.
The row highlighted in red is
the problem we started with,
when we had 23 individuals.
And we find that the 23 individuals,
already the chance of having
a birthday coincidence is 50% or
actually slightly more than 50%.
Many people find this very surprising,
right?
This is why it's called
the birthday paradox.
In fact, if you look at
assemblage of just 70 people,
the odds are now about 99% that there
will be a coincidence of birthdays.
