Summary of Tableau 12.
A potpourri of titillating applications.
Part 1.
Central tendency.
Stock portfolio selection and the curious
case of Sir Cyril Burt, psychologist.
Independence weaves a magnificent
path through the subject.
It crops up, most naturally,
in the concept of a random sample,
that of the repeated, independent trials.
Say X1, X2, X3, and so forth.
Suppose X is a typical exemplar of
the underlying chance experiment,
which is being repeated ad infinitum.
Let us say that X has
a probabilistic center of mass and
expectation, let's call that mu, and
that X has got an expected square
spread of variance, sigma squared.
Now, as we've seen repeatedly,
sums play a critical and
important role in the entire theory.
And so
naturally we hasten to form partial sums.
S1 is just X1.
S2 is X1 plus X2.
S3 is X1 plus X2 plus X3.
And so on,
as n being the sum of X1 through Xn.
And much of the basic
theory devolves around
the analysis of such accumulate
sums of independent variables.
Now in this context, it is important
to view things at a proper location and
with a proper scale.
So accordingly, we take a sum S sub n.
And normalize it to form this
normalized version we call Sn star.
And what is Sn star?
It locates Sn properly at its center,
in other words,
we relocate the origin
exactly at expected value and
then use it at a proper scale,
by shrinking or stretching the coordinate
axes, in such a way that we're
dealing with a dimensionless quantity.
A quantity with unit spread.
That is your Sn star.
Now, with this as background,
the key and central,
the most intuitive part of the theory
is the law of large numbers,
that venerable result from antiquity.
At its heart,
it says something about a law of averages.
If one stops a layperson in the street and
asks, what do you understand about charts?
You might well get a response
along the following lines.
Toss a coin 100 times and
you'll get 50 heads, and
in a sense she would be right.
Of course the mathematical clarification
of such an answer is given on your screen.
What we are really saying is that if
we look at the relative frequency,
Sn divided by n, then that quantity,
even though it is chance-driven,
via a very large number of
independent perturbations, even so,
this averaged quantity, Sn over n,
behaves essentially like a constant.
And which constant?
Inevitably, the underlying expectation
of the trials driving this process.
Inevitably, mu.
So, Sn over n is concentrated at mu.
And mathematically what that
means is that the deviation of
Sn over n from Mu is as small as you wish.
Provided the number of
trials becomes large enough.
We've seen beautiful,
subtle applications of this
fundamental principle, but
at its heart, it is not at all obvious.
It is true that we have grown accustomed
to such a statement such of a law of
averages, which works magically.
And perhaps we're so accustomed to it
that we don't pause to marvel at it.
If you look at it again, you realize that
it's saying something quite sensational,
quite remarkable.
We're adding many
independent perturbations,
each of the elements in the sum,
can vary any way you like and without
regard to the other elements in the sum.
What we've really constructed
is a function of a large number
of independently varied quantities.
And none the less, this function of
a large number of independently varying
quantities, is behaving, for
all intents and purposes, like a constant.
We've seen rich and
beautiful examples of this principle.
Where next?
Well, even its fondest adherents would
not say that the law of large numbers is
particularly sharp.
It is a blunt instrument.
You see, we're dividing by n and
n is a large quantity.
A more precise view occurs
when we take a look
at the expected value and
magnify what is happening around it.
This leads us to the quite
remarkable central limit theorem.
So if you view Sn, the partial sums,
properly normalized, in other words,
centered properly at this expected value
and scaled properly to have unit spread,
then this normalized
version Sn star essentially
behaves as if it were governed
by a magical bell curve.
The normal distribution,
the normal density,
emerges magically from these ruins.
Quite unexpected, quite remarkable and
extraordinarily subtle.
This is the one curve to rule them all.
This principle is behind much
of mathematical statistics.
And we've seen some beautiful
applications of this idea.

Where do we go from here?
Well, a magnificent meal should
not end with a single dessert.
So I'd like to offer you
one more tempting delicacy,
to titillate your palate,
to tempt you to look further.
This, in the next part
of the dessert tableau,
will take us into antiquity,
an ideal which was known to the Greeks,
and which has quite extraordinary,
modern reverberations.
And we shall rediscover
an old friend who appeared
apparently serendipitously out of the
wreck and ruin of the French Revolution.
The poisson distribution.
This is up next.
