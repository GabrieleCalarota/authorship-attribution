Laplace posed this
problem in the year 1812.
Today we call it
Laplace's Law of Succession.
This idea was to have
an entirely modern cast to it,
some oh, 150-80 years later.
This is our next application.
The picture on your screen
is that of the Great Pyramid
of Keops, constructed about 2580 BC.
And ever since then,
it has continued to inspire, to beguile,
to cause wonder in all its beholders.
The Great Financial Crash of 2008
caused enormous turmoil in
world financial markets.
And in that turmoil, companies large and
small were swept away in the rubble.
A large-scale casualty was
the venerable firm Lehman Brothers,
which, after 150 years of existence,
crumbled in that collapse.
The evolutionary process of natural
selection articulated by Darwin
has seen the emergence of
various species on the Earth.
Homo sapiens, in particular,
emerged out of Africa approximately
200,000 years ago and
continues to populate the planet.
Space exploration began in earnest
in the space race in the 1960s.
The international space station shown in
your picture was launched about 1998 and
has been continuously
inhabited since then.
Military coups have troubled the world's
history from times immemorial.
The cartoon on your screen shows
Napoleon Bonaparte trampling over egalite,
freedom, when he takes over France in
the early part of the 19th century.
Of course, these kinds of events repeat
and recur again and again in our history.
And they're not at all uncommon in
the 21st century, where a military coup,
or a junta, takes control of
a country with various reasons,
inevitably, with a promise to
restore normal functioning shortly.
But then the military power continues
unabated for a period of time.
What do all these examples in
these images have in common?
If we abstract out a key idea, it is that
of a phenomenon which crops up into
existence at some point in time,
and exists for a certain period
of time before it vanishes.
The Great Pyramid of Keops,
constructed about 2580 BC, and
lasting for well,
we don't know whe, how long.
The space station launched in 1998 has
a lifetime of some time in the future.
A firm, a startup, a company,
launched at some time in the past and
has an existence,
a lifetime of some ec, duration.
In all these cases, at the current moment,
we observe that phenomenon.
What we have seen is that
the phenomenon has existed for
a certain period of time,
an elapsed time, let's call that r.
And the phenomenon is going
to continue to exist for
a certain additional period of
time till its lifetime is done.
This is the, a future time for
the phenomenon.
A question, whimsical to be sure,
that one might pose is the following.
At the point of time where we observe
this phenomenon, say the Great Pyramid of
Keops, the phenomenon has been in
existence for a certain amount of time.
So the Pyramid of Keops has been in
existence for about 4,600 years.
So the phenomenon has continued unabated.
It has lived for,
let us say, little r days.
Given that phenomenon has existed for
r days,
what can we say about the chance
that it will persist for
an additional s days?
Hm.
This looks worse than tenuous.
It's not at all clear what
the underlying sample space for
such an experiment might be.
What is the distribution of
the lifetime of the phenomenon?
Well, we don't know.
And the varied examples I've given you
show very different kinds of phenomena.
We don't even have the beginnings of
a model for lifetime distributions.
Could we make any progress?
Well, here is an idea.
This was articulated by the Princeton
astrophysicist Richard Gott in 1993,
and the idea was to posit a principle for
future time given a certain elapsed time.
And Gott's idea is what we could
today call the Copernican principle.
And it can be encapsulated very snappily,
in a very memorable fashion
by saying that the point of
observation is not special.
Now, what does that mean, and where
does Copernicus come into the picture?
Let me take you back to about
two millennia to about 100 AD,
and the world that was
seen by Claudius Ptolemy.
Ptolemy was a mathematician,
an astrographer, an astronomer,
a sometime writer and poet.
And by detailed and
careful observations, he figures out
the particular orbits of each
celestial body around the earth.
This is now what we call
the Ptolemaic universe.
The orbits that each body takes on,
around the earth are quite complex.
They form cycles, epicycles,
epicycles upon epicycles, a senior figure.
But if one is careful,
one can very painstakingly construct
individual orbits for every celestial
body as it circumnavigates the Earth.
Now this model had
substantial enduring power.
This model of the universe persisted for
about 1,300 years,
until Nicholas Copernicus in about
the early part of the 16th century,
around 1510,
said the model is not accurate.
Copernicus by dint of observation
posited that a proper
model would be to place the sun at
the center of the known universe.
And soon after Copernicus
postulated this revolutionary,
reactionary idea, Kepler,
about 80 years later,
by dint of careful observation,
figured out that every celestial object in
the skies has beautifully regular
geometric orbits around the sun.
And about a hundred years later,
Isaac Newton,
through the discovery of
universal gravitation.
Discovered that all of this could be
described through a very simple mechanical
experiment.
By one equation, force is equal
to mass times acceleration, and
this gives you all the elliptical
orbits that we are familiar with today.
What does this have to do with our
problem of the existence of a phenomenon?
Well, here's a key principle.
The key idea that Copernicus articulated,
which overturned 1,300
years of Ptolemaic dogma,
was that the Earth was not the center
of the universe, but the Sun was.
Revolutionary, reactionary,
dangerous, but accurate.
His idea was in a large sense
a huge blow to our collective egos.
We could paraphrase
what he said by saying,
we do not have a special
place in the universe.
We are not special.
Now, if you take this principle and
apply it to our setting of a phenomenon.
The Copernican principle says
the observation point is not special.
What that could say is that
the observation point is just
as likely to be in the first quartile
of the existence of the phenomenon
as in the last quartile of
the existence of the phenomenon.
We should make haste to understand
that this is an assumption.
A naive, blind
utilization of such an assumption
could lead to ridiculous results.
But let us take this assumption,
which on face value is,
doesn't seem unexceptionable,
at least in perhaps,
in some circumstances, which are not,
understandably, well-specified yet.
But if we take this principle to heart,
what does it say?
It says effectively that a Laplacian
law of succession is an operation.
Look at a Laplacian
equation on the top right.
What does it say?
We recall, the experiment
was drawing balls repeatedly
from a randomly selected urn.
Given that r red balls have
been drawn in succession,
the chance that s subsequent balls
drawn are red is approximately,
when the urns are very large in number,
about r plus 1 divided by s plus r plus 1.
If we posit a model of Copernican
uncertainty to the observation point,
then an approximately
equivalent Laplacian prior
might posit that
a conditional probability,
whatever the underlining
probability space is,
of the future duration being at least s,
given that
r days have elapsed in the phenomenon's
existence is about r over s plus r.
You should compare the Copernican
principle as we outlined it with
the Laplacian model for
the Laplace's law of succession.
And we realize this is essentially
articulating the same principle of
Laplacian uncertainty.
Of course, you know, you could caveat
this kind of, of a touchy feely,
loosey goosey application of probabilities
when it's not even clear what
the underlining sample space for
the experiment is.
But let us see where this kind of
modeling format or assumption leads us.
Various diverting calculations can be, can
be made once we make such an assumption.
And let me show you a couple.
So to begin,
what can we say about the probability
that the future time for this phenomenon,
the future existence,
lies between r over 39 and
39 times r given that
the elapsed time is r days.
Now, I can immediately
write an equation down, but
this would probably require
a little bit of thought.
Let's begin with the first
term on the right.
The probability that
the future time exceeds r over
39 given that the elapsed
time is little r days.
Now, if the future time exceeds r over 39.
This can happen in one of two ways.
Certainly, this event will occur if
the future time exceeds 39r days.
This is the event on
the right of the equation.
It can also happen if the future
time lies between r over 39 and 39r.
This is the event to
the left of the equation.
And therefore all you've written
down is the principle of additivity.
We've broken down the event that
the future time exceeds r over
39 into two disjoint pieces.
The future time is between r over 39 and
39r, and the future time exceeds 39r.
And the moment you write
something like this down,
we can immediately turn through
our Copernican assumption.
And plug in,
identifying with future duration little s,
the values r over 39 and
39r, respectively.
And now an elementary calculation
shows that we get a number, 0.95.
In words, in this model there's
a 95% chance that the future
existence of the phenomenon
lies between r over 39 and
39 times r, given that a phenomenon
has existed for little r days.
Let's try one more example.
What is the conditional probability that
the future existence of the phenomenon
is at least r over 3 and no more than 3r
given that the phenomenon has exited,
existed for little r days?
Again, additivity allows us to write down,
in one fell swoop, a decomposition.
And now,
we plug in our Copernican assumption,
churn through the algebra, and
we find that the chance that
the future existence of the phenomenon
lies between r over 3 and
3r given that the phenomenon
has existed for r days is 50%.
Curiouser and curiouser.
Of course, you might ask how did I pick
these strange numbers, r over 39 and 39r.
r over 3, and 3r.
Of course, a short answer is, I chose
those numbers because I knew what I was
doing and I wanted to get nice
answers at the right, 95%, 50%.
You could replace the bookend of
these inequalities by other values.
Try that and see what you get.
Our conclusion from this is as follows.
There is a 95% chance that
a phenomenon will not persist for
more than 39 times the elapsed
duration of the phenomenon.
There's a 50% chance the phenomenon
will be extinguished within
three times the elapsed
duration of the phenomenon.
All right.
What does this say?
Well, let's go back to the pictures
we had at the various eclectic
phenomena I showed you and
come up with some amusing consequences.
Goff points out that assuming
a 4,600 year existence for
the Great Pyramid of Cheops,
the pyramid will continue to fascinate and
beguile, create wonder and intrigue for
maybe another 180,000 years,
before it disappears into
the sands of the desert.
This, with a 95% confidence.
Hm, the existence of Homo
sapiens is an epiphenomenon.
Assuming a 200,000 year current
history for the species,
the Copernican principle
in this formulation says,
if you multiply it by about 39 or 40,
that it predicates the continued
existence of the species,
our species, for
an initial about 8 million years.
7.8 million years, but who's counting?
With a 95% confidence, and
then after about 8 million years,
the species quietly
disappears like a dildo,
into the well of extinguished species.
Now that's very sad.
But God, whimsically, provides an out.
This is, well, but what if a species
managed to leave the Earth's gravitational
whirl and colonize other planets?
Then you might be able to evade this 7.8
million year moratorium in existence.
But wait.
To leave the planet surface
would require space exploration.
But space exploration
is a modern phenomenon.
It has been in existence for
about 50 years or so.
So given that space exploration as
a phenomenon, has existed for 50 years,
there is a 50% chance that we will not
explore space after 150 years from now.
And so, here's a tongue-and-cheek
exhortation for colonizing space, for
investing in the space program.
Our future existence, in this
tongue-and-cheek model, depends upon it.
A word of caution would be wise here.
The model assumptions are large and
sweeping.
We cannot cavalierly apply it
willy-nilly all over the place.
For example,
it would be ridiculous to apply the
Copernican principle to a non-Algerian.
The principal says that a longer
a phenomenon has been in existence,
the longer is predicted future existence.
Thirty-nine times are with
a 95% confidence.
Three times are with a 50% confidence.
But, a non-Algerian does not
have much longer to live,
given the biological constraints on
the species as we have them today.
The Copernican principle would
fail badly in such a context.
Right.
Now, what is manifest here is that,
in such a setting, the observation
point is manifestly special.
If you choose the observation point
towards the end of a person's lifetime,
then there is not much
surviving life to come.
Another example might be for
instance, a second term
president of the United States.
If a president is in his seventh year,
then that would,
by the Copernican principle,
predicate a fairly long future tenure,
much longer than say,
a president in his first year.
But this would, again, be a bad misreading
and application of the principle.
The rules of the game in the United States
put a two-term limit, currently,
on presidents, so a president cannot
serve for more than eight years.
So if you look at a president
in his seventh year,
there is very little time left in his or
her presidency.
But there are other settings where
the principle might well seem to be
approximately applicable.
Could you think of something?
In a modern context, how about a start up?
Common experience tells us that
start ups are extinguished in
large numbers very early.
Very few start ups survive
more than a few years.
But if a start up survives its teething
pains, gets richer capital funding,
starts to make a profit,
builds on the profit and
starts to create a larger enterprise,
creates an IPO so
it becomes public and becomes large.
Then suddenly,
you have something with staying power.
So then, you have something like, let's
say, an international business machine,
an IBM, maybe an Amazon.com.
Something which survives from
a setting where companies were
falling in drove in the early stages.
A few survived.
But the moment they survive,
they become big.
They tend to persist for a long time.
Here's a setting where one could think of
applying the Copernican principle, and
surely there is ample data out there
that we can test the principle on.
For our purposes, the idea was,
one, it was interesting.
It's fun, it's amusing.
It is a simple application of
the Laplacian model of succession,
to posit a probability model where it is
not clear where the sample space was.
But nonetheless, useful and intriguing
predictions arise out of the setting.
For our purposes,
we think of this as an application
of the theorem of total probability.
