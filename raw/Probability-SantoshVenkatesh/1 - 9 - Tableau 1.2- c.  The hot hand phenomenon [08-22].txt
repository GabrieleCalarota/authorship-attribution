A casual spectator at a sporting
event is assuredly acquainted with
the phenomenon where some player on
the field goes on a torrid streak where he
can apparently do no wrong.
In basketball parlance,
this is sometimes called a hot hand.
To put things in context,
consider the following setting.
Exhibit A, a basketball player,
a good player.
He typically makes one basket
out of every two shots he takes.
Imagine that in a game where he
takes many shots, say 50 shots,
somewhere in that sequence he
scores 5 baskets in a row.
We say that he has a hot hand.
Conventional wisdom dictates
that scoring five in a row for
a player who typically makes
one in two is unusual, right?
The chance that if he just makes 5 shots,
say the first 5 shots,
the chance they all go in is only 1 in 32.
This looks very small.
And therefore, the fact that he
has made five in a row seems to be
bonafide evidence that
he is on a purple patch.
He is, has a hot hand.
He has an altered mental state
where he can do no wrong and
therefore it is natural for fans and for
his teammates to try to milk
that run of successes as much
as possible by getting the ball so
that the entire run can be milked.
Now, this is so self-evident, and
we all buy into it,
that it hardly needs defense or does it?
Here is a counter intuitive possibility.
What if, on the other hand,
this streak of successes for
this player is not at all unusual, but
it's just to be expected from
sheer chance fluctuations.
Hm.
We now have another possibility, almost
heretical, because it seems to run so
counter to our native intuition.
But having put it up there,
we now have two possibilities.
Which of these is actually correct?
Of course, our coin tossing example and
our examining of streaks of successes,
success runs, points the connection
to the coin tossing problem.
And this enables, enables us to put in
place a principled statistical
test of a hypothesis.
What does a test comprise?
Very, very simple.
Imagine that a player
has taken 50 shots and
he's got a particular sequence of
successes and failures in making baskets.
The test involves comparing the
statistical properties of that sequence
with what one would get if
one tossed a coin 50 times.
This is an example of what is called
in German a Gedankenexperiment,
a thought experiment.
I don't actually have to
toss a coin 50 times, but
I could certainly conceive of it.
Imagine that one were to toss a coin 50
times, would the sequences of heads and
tails, successes or failures that
we obtained, look statistically
different from what we observed for
the player on the court?
And now of course, the surprising
results that I had put before you
suggest that there is a test we can make,
by comparison, and that the test
might have an unexpected result.
Now, this is a political age, and
a political age demands a slogan.
So let me promptly give you a slogan.
And here it is.
The more likely it is that in
a string of coin tosses we
observe a successful one of
the length that we see on the court,
the less there is evidence for
a mysterious, other worldly hot hand.
Let me rephrase this.
After all,
if in a string of coin tosses it is
not at all unlikely that we observe
five heads in a row somewhere.
Then why should we, because we
observed five success in a row on
the basketball court, ascribe to it
anything unusual, otherworldly, magical.
Well, such phenomena are readily
explicable by just natural,
random coin tossing fluctuation.
And indeed, the table I've given
you gives us immediate evidence.
And this time,
against our basic hypothesis.
Imagine that the coin was tossed 50 times.
We are looking for
a success run of length five.
The odds of this,
as we see in the table, are 55%.
If one tossed a coin 50 times,
then 55% of the time we'll observe success
runs of length 5 or more somewhere.
It is not at all surprising, therefore,
that a player who makes 1 and
2 baskets will in a string of 50 attempts,
somewhere make a string of 5 in a row.
Now, this suggests that there is
no evidence for the hot hand for
the particular example I have contrived.
But this was a starting point for
an extensive and
deep statistical investigation by a team
of three statisticians, Gilovich at
Harvard University, and Vallone and
Tversky at Stanford University.
And they published the results
of their study in 1985.
They had examined an entire season's work
of players FS in the National Basketball
Association, and this was the conclusion.
Based on capital statistical analysis
of all that data, they concluded
that the hot hand theory
is a widespread cognitive
illusion affecting all beholders,
players, and coaches alike.
In other words,
there was no statistical evidence at
all in favor of a mysterious hot hand.
Everything that was observed could
be explicable just by natural,
random fluctuations.
A postscript to the story.
It's amusing in its own right, but
a post-script here as reported by
Daniel Kahneman in his wonderful book
of 2011, Thinking Fast and Slow.
And Kahneman reports that,
perhaps apocryphally, a reporter for
the Boston Globe took
the results of this paper and
went to the redoubtable coach of
the Boston Celtics, Red Aurbach and said,
Hey Red,
this guy at Harvard says that there is no,
nothing at all in this idea of a hot hand,
it is all explicable by chance.
To which, the famously erasable
Red Auerbach apparently grunted,
so some guy did a study.
What do I care?
Of course, we do care.
As the probabilist
William Fellow has remarked,
even strong faith must be
subject to a statistical test.
And our question then is, how do we
put such principal tests together so
that we can come up with
logical conclusions?
This, in essence,
is the heart of our course.
