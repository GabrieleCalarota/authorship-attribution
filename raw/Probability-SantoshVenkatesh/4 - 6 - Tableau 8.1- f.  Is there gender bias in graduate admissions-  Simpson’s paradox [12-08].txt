Is there gender bias in
admissions in elite universities?
A question like this is fraught
with cultural significance,
with ethical and moral issues,
and possibly a legal liability.
In 1973 at the University
of California at Berkley,
44% of male applicants were
admitted into graduate study,
while 35% of female applicants
were admitted to graduate study.
This appears to be
incontrovertible evidence that
men were favored over women in admissions.
A study was done on Berkley admissions
data, by Bickel, Hammel, and O'Connell,
and published in 1975.
And the conclusions were
[SOUND] possibly paradoxical.
So let us explain, and figure out what
the setting was that they discovered.
We shall use the Berkeley
study as a guideline.
And, of course, a modern university will
have several thousands of applicants
and a vast number of possible departments
into which these applicants will apply.
And, it'll be difficult to sift
our way through all these,
a myriad of complexities.
Let us borrow from the Berkeley study and
imagine a sanitized
view of an application process
in a mythical university, and
two stereotypically driven
fanciful departments, say,
the Department of Social Warfare and
the Department of Machismatics.
So in this made up study, there are 440
applicants, 220 men and 220 women.
The women applied in a number of 200
to the Department of Social Warfare.
And of the 200 applicants,
female applicants to social warfare,
20 were admitted.
20 women applied to the Department of
Machismatics, and 19 were admitted.
On the side of the men,
20 men applied to the Department
of Social Warfare, 1 was admitted.
200 men applied to the Department of
Machismatics, and 100 were admitted.
Now if we aggregate this data for
the entire admissions process,
we find that cumulatively
39 out of 220 women were
admitted to graduate study in
this fictional university,
while 101 men out of 220 were
admitted to this university.
And when we look at the admissions ratio,
we find that for
female applicants,
roughly 18% were admitted.
And of the male applicants,
roughly 46% were admitted.
This is in favor of the men by about
two and a half men to each woman.
It appears to have contained
incontrovertible evidence
that there is a strong
bias in favor of the men.
But wait a minute, let's take a more
fine-grained look at this picture.
Let us take a look and
now add the admissions information
to the individual departments.
Now when you look at social warfare,
20 out of 200 women were admitted for
an admissions rate of 10%,
1 out of 20 men were admitted for
an admissions rate of 5%.
In machismatics, 19 out of 20 women were
admitted for an admissions rate of 95%.
And 100 out of 200 men were admitted for
an admissions rate of 50%.
And one finds, looking at these ratios,
that rather unfairly,
these inequalities have changed
directions, women are almost twice as
likely to have been admitted in this made
up study for each individual department.
But, men are more than twice as likely
to have been admitted to the university.
A paradox.
Or, is there one?
On closer examination, one finds
the explanation of the seeming paradox.
Women in this study were much more likely
to apply to a much more
selective department.
And so even though women were more likely
to admitted to each of the individual
departments, collectively
fewer women were admitted.
This illustrates the perils of
jumping to conclusions by a rough and
ready aggregation of data willy-nilly.
In this instance,
an aggregate of data conceals essential
evidence that women in the study were
applying to more selective departments and
as a consequence,
fewer women were admitted.
It would be worth putting some notational
and mathematical framework around it so
that we can see this in fair and
just proportion.
So let's look at the study again anew,
and at this time let's try to
identify a proper probability space and
a model for chance for this picture.
And so, what is a sample space for
the problem?
Well, the sample space constitutes
the 440 applicants to this
university, 220 men, 220 women.
What constitutes a chance experiment here?
Imagine now we have this
pool of 440 applicants.
We reach in blindly and
pick an applicant at random from the pool.
Random selection implies
a combinatorial setting where
any one of the 440 applicants
is equally likely of selection.
Now once you select an applicant,
certain attributes of the applicant
now will become visible.
First, at a high level,
was that applicant admitted to study or
to study at the university or rejected?
Let's call it event A.
A the event that the applicant
chosen randomly was admitted.
A complement, that the event
that the applicant was rejected.
That applicant could be male or female.
Let's call W the event that
the chosen applicant was a woman.
W complement then means that
the chosen applicant was a man.
And that applicant could apply
to one of two departments.
Let S represent the event that
the applicant applied to the,
to the Department of Social Warfare.
Let S complement therefore denote
the event that the applicant applied
to the Department of Machismatics.
Now here is a fine-grained view,
a department specific view,
of the applications process.
What we discover is that the probability
that the applicant is admitted,
given that the applicant is a woman and
applied to the Department of
Social Warfare, exceeds the probability
that the applicant is admitted.
Given that the applicant is
a man applying to social warfare
in odds ratios of 10% to 5%.
Likewise, we find that the probability
that the applicant is admitted given that
it is a woman applying to machismatics,
the second line in the picture.
Exceeds that of the chance of
the applicant being admitted
given that it is a man applying
to the Department of Machismatics
in the odds of 95% to 50%.
Now this is the fine-grained
departmental-specific view, and
these conditional probabilities capture
the essence of a mathematical observation.
What about the aggregate view for
the university at large?
Remarkably, we find that it is possible
in spite of the departmental tendencies
going in one direction, for the aggregate
tendency to go in the opposite direction.
The chance that the applicant is admitted,
given that it is a woman,
is smaller than the chance of
the applicant being admitted,
given that it is a man.
The odds of 18% to 46%, remarkable.
This paradox has been known for
a long time.
For more than a century,
it was remarked by Yule in 1903.
But it was articulated readily with
a handsome range of interesting and
intriguing examples by E.H.
Simpson in 1951, and
therefore it's named after Simpson.
The paradox arises in
a multitude of common settings.
Replace this fictional university by,
for example, the reaction of women and
men to two different drugs
treating in a particular ailment.
Say we find that women do better than
the men on each of the two drugs.
Does that mean that
women do better overall?
If you aggregate the information,
you might find that fewer women benefit
than men do, and it's the same paradox.
Again here, the fine grain
information is of relevance, and
accrued aggregate here,
conceals and distorts the picture.
We could replace the sexes, the genders
by, for example, people from two different
ethnic communities, given two different
drugs to treat a particular ailment.
And again, we have a basis for
a seeming paradox.
Of course, in that instance,
you might find that a more efficacious
drug is given in larger percentage to
a particular ethnic community because
of economic or cultural constraints.
And a less efficacious drug is given to
the other community in larger proportion,
again, because of these economic or
cultural constraints.
There are settings also where
the aggregate might have more
information than
the fine-grained in the picture.
For example,
imagine now that we are looking at
our returns in a financial setting for
a portfolio of a given size.
And let's say we are looking at
investments in two different investment
vehicles, in different proportions.
In one case we find that for
each particular port investment vehicle,
one strategy,
one proportion does better than the other.
But in aggregate, the second
strategy does better than the first.
Now in a picture like this, arguably,
the aggregate is perhaps of first
importance to the individual.
Because, one might ask,
what happens to my entire portfolio in
terms of my returns on investment overall?
How is my wealth growing?
As opposed to, how are the individual
segments go, growing?
These paradoxes have seemed to appear
on a routine basis in the popular news,
almost on a yearly basis, right?
For our purposes, it's an amusing story.
It points to a cautionary tale that one
should be careful in how we aggregate or
lump information together.
And it reinforces our slogan,
conditioning affects
event probabilities in strange and
wondrous ways.
