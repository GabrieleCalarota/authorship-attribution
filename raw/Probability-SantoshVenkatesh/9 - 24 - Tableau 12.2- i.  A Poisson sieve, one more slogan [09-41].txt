In Poisson's discovery of 1837,
we have found accidentally,
as it were, a curious little
approximation to the binomial.
Though as we saw in the century and
a half that followed,
this discovery had entrancing and
unexpected effects.
And now through another venerable
artifact, the method of inclusion and
exclusion, we find the binomial
reappearing again,
accidentally, serendipitously.
Are these discoveries then connected?
The idea of the binomial to the Poisson,
is it part of a deeper phenomenon or
was it just mere serendipity?
Well surely, we can't simply dismiss it as
accidental without further investigation.
And this line of thought is going to lead
us to the discovery of a delicate and
beautiful Poisson sieve.
To understand where this arises,
we should go back and
review what we have discovered
in the case of the binomial.
So, the question now is
what is at the heart
of this Poisson approximation for
the binomial?
Well, let's start with the simpler
setting for inclusion and
exclusion where we have a collection
of independent events and
where every event has
the same probability p.
We promptly introduce
the idea of an indicator,
which captures whenever an event occurs.
And our discovery was that the
inclusion-exclusion formula promptly drops
the binomial distribution into our laps.
The number of occurrences
of these independent events
is governed by the binomial
distribution with parameters n and p.
Now, whence the Poisson distribution,
where does it arise?
Well of course,
we got the Poisson through the binomial
in the province of rare events.
So let's consider a situation
where the events A1 through An,
the bad events, as it were, are rare.
What does that mean?
It means the chance of occurrence
of any one of them, p, is small.
We're going to look at an asymptotic
regime, where n, the number of events,
is quite large.
So we have a lot of bad events, each
with a small probability of occurrence.
And the expected number of the events
that occur is a moderate number,
n times p, that we call lambda.
Now, let us step through the inclusion
exclusion argument again,
very quickly this time, to get a feeling
for why things worked the way they did.
So we'll begin with
the inclusion exclusion sums.
In this case,
the sums are simple to characterize,
because the events are independent.
And immediately we get a binomial
coefficient times a power of P.
Well, we simplify
the binomial coefficient.
Write it out.
We find a falling factorial in the
numerator, factorial in the denominator.
But the falling factorial has got k plus j
terms, each of which is approximately n.
Remember, n is large.
And we will want to look in a regime where
k is relatively small compared to n.
And in this case, we discover that these
inclusion-exclusion sums appear to
be of the form of a power of a fixed
parameter lambda divided by a factorial.
So far so good.
This is just purely algebraic
manipulation and reassembly of terms.
When we put it back into
the inclusion-exclusion formula,
now something interesting and
deep starts to arise.
Each of the inclusion-exclusion
sums now is the form of a,
of a power over a factorial.
We reassemble terms, and
we find on the right a sum,
which looks like an exponential.
It's the old adage again.
If it walks like a duck, if it quacks
like a duck, it's got to be a duck.
If it walks like an exponential,
if it quacks like an exponential,
it's got to be an exponential.
That sum is an approximation
to an exponential function.
In fact, it's a truncated exponential
series whose parameter is minus lambda.
And so, without further ado,
we find a beautiful approximation,
a Poisson approximation
emerging out of the ruins.
Accidental?
Not so hasty.
What was at the heart of this discovery?
Right, all of this was just algebraic
manipulation, and something beautiful and
unexpected dropped into our laps.
We should surely look back and
ask, where did this come from?
Was it purely accidental?
And when you trace it back, we discover
that this progression was permitted
because the inclusion-exclusion
sums had a particular character.
The inclusion-exclusion
sums were of the form
of a power divided by a factorial.
And whence the power?
Of course, the power arises,
it's a product, it arises because
of an underlying independence.
This was a bounty of independence, and
this was at the heart of the Poisson
approximation to the binomial.
The independent trials engender products,
and
that led to the inclusion-exclusion
sums being powers of the factorials.
And the moment you had that, the rest
was just simple algebraic calculus,
just chugging through the motions,
as it were.
And out comes an exponential.
This leads us now to suspect that
the Poisson discovery was
not merely accidental.
That the Poisson is waiting to be
discovered the moment we have events
which are independent, or
perhaps only approximately independent.
And this now essentially
gives us a beautiful theorem
which gives us a Poisson sieve.
So let's write down what our discovery is.
What we're going to do now is move
into a generic framework where we have
a system of events A1 through An.
Think of them as bad events, rare events.
Fortunately these bad
things happen rarely.
Bad things happen to good people
only very, very occasionally.
So these are the bad events.
We're going to think of these as going
to be perhaps not independent but
perhaps approximately independent, where
the level of dependency is not strong.
If that is the case,
then we could hope for
a power over a factorial to emerge for
the inclusion-exclusion sums.
The moment you do that, everything else
will carry through without change in toto.
So the key here is
a bounty of independence.
That inclusion-exclusion sums look
like the powers of a fixed quantity
divided by a factorial.
The power is going to arise because
the probability of an intersection
of things which are nearly independent
should be a power, should be a product.
And if that is the case,
the entire argument just carries through.
The number of bad events that occur,
the number of rare events that occur,
is covered by a Poisson law.
And the expectation of the Poisson
is exactly the parameter lambda
which is appearing in the power.
And in particular, the probability
that no bad events happen, a fortiori,
is given by simply an exponential
with exponent minus lambda.
You see now the prominence
of where this idea is,
that this is actually
a sieve is appearing.
We have a lot of events, n,
a lot of trials, if you will,
which are not perhaps independent but
close to being independent.
The level of dependency is
small in some formal sense.
Given a large number of bad events,
how many bad events actually occur?
Well, covered by the fixed parameter,
lambda.
And therefore, what we're really doing
is metaphorically straining through
a collection of bad events and
happening to catch a few.
This is the idea,
the metaphorical idea of a sieve.
What we have discovered is a very
delicate Poisson sieve for the problem.
Of course this is the formal
trappings of the problem as it were.
But a slogan is always nice to have
because it captures for us the essence
of a mathematical theorem, without,
of course, a great deal of precision.
So promptly, here is a slogan.
The number of bad events or
rare events that occur
is generically governed by a Poisson law.
