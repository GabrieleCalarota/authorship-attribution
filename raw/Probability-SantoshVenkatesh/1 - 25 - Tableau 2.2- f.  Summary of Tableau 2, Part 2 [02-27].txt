At this point we have now understood
something about the nature of binomial
coefficients, how they interact with each
other, and their essential properties.
Let's now summarize what we understand
about this issue of
sampling from populations.
So, at heart, we're going to start with
a finite set, a finite population,
let's say, of n elements.
We are going to sample
from this population, and
we're going to draw a sample of size k.
If the sample is an ordered
sample where the order matters,
then if the sampling is with replacement,
there are n to the k possibilities.
If the sampling is without replacement,
then there are n to the k
falling possibilities.
If the sample constitutes a subpopulation
of size k, a subset of size k,
without order,
then there are n choose k possibilities.
The binomial coefficients themselves
give you various identities and
various alternative representations.
So, for example,
n choose k may be written alternatively
in other forms involving ratios
of factorials or in terms of yet
other binomial coefficients
such as n choose n minus k.
Pascal's triangle allows you to
decompose binomial coefficients
in terms of the rows in Pascal's triangle.
N choose k can be decomposed in terms of
the binomial coefficients immediately
below it at the base of a triangle
in terms of n minus 1 choose k,
and n minus 1 choose k minus 1.
And finally the binomial theorem allows
you to take a sum and raise to a power and
expand it in terms of a polynomial
involving the binomial coefficients.
Now these are the essential
properties of binomial coefficients.
If you have these under your belt,
you are good to go.
Our next tableau takes us directly
into the realm of chance.
And we begin by exploring
chance in elementary settings.
With the idea that we discover
essential features, properties, which
are readily intuited in these elementary
levels and build on these features and
properties to construct a formal
foundation for an abstract science.
