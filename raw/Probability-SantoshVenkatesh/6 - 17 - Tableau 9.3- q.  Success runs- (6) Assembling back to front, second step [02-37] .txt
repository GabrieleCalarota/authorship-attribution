What's the next step in our book keeping?
So at this point, we know in
principle all the value u sub n.
The next step of course
is to work backwards and
now compute the first success run
probabilities f n by our second equation.
And our slogan.
Was that if I know the u's in
principal I can construct the f's.
Let's start with the,
the initial conditions for the f.
We know that f1, f2,
f3 and f4 are all either
0 because there can no success run
terminating in the first four trials.
What about f5?
Well, in our equation for
fn, put in n equal to 5.
And just write down what transpires.
On the right, we discover u5,
and terms u1 through u4.
But u1 through u4 are 0, as we can
read off directly from the table.
And so they have no contribution to
be some, and we simply have fu5,
and therefore f5,
the probability of a first success run
at trial 5 is 2 to the power minus 5.
Let's do a couple more just to
make sure we're getting the,
the flow of the calculations
under our belt.
Put in n equal to 6 we have f6.
F6 devolves upon u6 as
well as u1 through u5.
But u1 through u4 are 0,
the only contributions are from u5 and u6.
But u5 contributes nothing too because
it is in conjunction with f1 which is 0.
And therefore you only get u6.
And u6 is 2 to the power minus 6.
As we read from the table and so we now we
got f6, f7, likewise, put in n equal to 7.
And again we notice, on the right,
terms f1 through f4 contribute nothing.
Terms u1 through u4 contribute nothing.
And, therefore, the only contribution
on the right is from u7.
And so we get f7 to be
a gain 2 to the minus 6 and
now we can systematically build up
these f values as we say in our table.
Again notice that we get various
fractions, these are exact.
We have power of two in the denominator
but of course they're getting ugly and
the fractions themselves don't
give us much of a feel for
how the probabilities are behaving.
There is very little
identification in seeing one large
number divided by another large number.
Our institution isn't
built along those lines.
But we will look at it in
a simpler decimal form
just as soon as we got
everything under our belts.
