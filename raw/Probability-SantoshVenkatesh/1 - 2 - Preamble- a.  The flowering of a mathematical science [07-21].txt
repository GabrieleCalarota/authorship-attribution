Hello.
I'm Santosh Venkatesh of the University
of Pennsylvania, and you are about
to enter the strange and wonderful world
of probability, the theory of chance,
its historical context and
its applications in the modern world.
Before we begin in right earnest,
it will be good to provide a preamble,
a prelude to a theory, in which I sketch
out for you some of the background,
some of the motivations behind
the development of the theory.
The requisite background for
a student to be able to draw
something from these lectures.
A brief view of the organization
of these lectures.
And finally, a very,
very brief word on the learning and
studying of the science of mathematics.
So, without further ado, let me
begin by talking about the flowering of
a mathematical science of probability.
Now it is very rare in human
history that a subject
abruptly unfolds at
a particular point in time.
It is usually a gradual
accretion of ideas and
movements, which results,
ultimately, in a subject developing.
And, so it is, with the theory of chance.
The subject itself is of some antiquity.
And there have been various points in
time where developments have been made.
But a key development occurred in
the early part of the 19th century,
with the publication in 1812 of
the epochal volume of Pierre-Simon,
Marquis de Laplace.
The Analytical Theory of Probability.
Laplace was the foremost
mathematical physicist of his time.
But in the early part of the 19th century,
he had turned his attention to chance and
its manifestations in
the world around him.
You should bear in mind
the context of that time.
It was a century of turmoil.
This was the immediate aftermath
of the French Revolution.
Society was undergoing great changes,
and so was science.
Deep foundational discoveries were being
made at the very heart of mathematics.
And applications of these were
being seen in society around us.
Laplace opined that understanding a theory
of chance was going to be the key and
central endeavor of science
in the ensuing century.
And he was right in many ways.
We shall see as we go along
one of the problems that
exercised Laplace's imagination.
But for the time being,
let us move forward a century.
The evidence of chance around
us that Laplace had seen and
had cogitated on had become even
more evident in the 20th century.
A little more than a century
after Laplace wrote those words,
Bertrand Russell, the English
mathematician, philosopher, and
logician, in a famous lecture in 1929,
echoed what Laplace had said.
That in the 20th century,
the concept of chance,
the theory of chance was going to be the
most important endeavor facing science.
And he ended up with a wry comment
echoing the understanding of that time,
that while chance was wild in the world
around, and while there were all kinds
of calculations being done on
the theory of chance, it was not clear
from a mathematical point of view what
exactly this mathematical object was.
You can imagine a mathematician
wryly sniggering behind his hand,
saying, well, these people doing
probability calculations are all
very well; they are all very nice people.
But really,
this is hardly mathematics, is it?
Now, this was going to be very shortly
resolved just four short years later.
The Russian mathematician, Andrei
Kolmogorov set about putting in place
a formal mathematical framework for
this inchoate theory, which had
been burgeoning and, and developing over
the centuries, and he was successful.
Out of his work came a fully
formal understanding of
a mathematical theory of chance.
And from this point on,
the theory of probability was
an affirmed mathematical foundation.
This is a theory which will
exercise our imagination,
will occupy us for the next eight weeks.
Now a cautionary word, when historically
a mathematical theory develops,
there is a tendency towards abstraction.
And of course, the idea behind abstraction
is to capture key and essential features
of a problem, without obfuscating
it with a lot of irrelevant detail.
But there is a danger in
unbridled abstraction.
In such instances,
a theory runs the risk of becoming so
esoteric, so specialized,
that only a very small group
of highly trained specialists can
then gain entry into the canon.
In such cases, mathematical
theories tend to occupy niches,
which are occupied by a few specialists
who deal with that subject.
It is when a mathematical theory
hews closer to physical reality
that it sees its larger successes,
that it exercises the minds and
imaginations of people at large.
And Kolmogorov was quite aware of this,
as you see in the last sentence
that I have quoted for you.
Much of his motivation arose from concrete
physical problems where chance was wild.
And in, as the 20th century
progressed into the 21st century,
in this the mathematical theory of
chance has been wildly successful.
There are few mathematical theories
where theory interplays with
ribald application so
beautifully, so wonderfully.
Theory applies,
applications inform theory.
And this interplay makes both the richer.
This theory and its rich applications
are the subject of these lectures.
