We could look at sophisticated examples
of Boole's sieve in operation,
but we have bigger fish to catch here.
So I'm going to give you a whimsical
example just to illustrate how
an apparently unprofitable terile,
dry terrain, there are possibilities for
analytical investigation.
So the question I'm going to give you is
that of a party game of no great moment.
You could imagine playing
this with people in a group.
The issue is embedding a cube in
a sphere colored with two colors.
So here's a generic sphere.
Two colours, let's say a red and blue.
And what we're going to do is
we're going to take the sphere and
we're going to embed a cube in it,
of course, so that the vertices of the
cube are on the surface of this sphere.
So we're going to put
a cube inside this sphere.
We're going to be free to arrange
the cube in any orientation we want.
Here is a whimsical question,
given a two-coloured sphere,
with some percentage of red and
blue, and some water on the surface.
Is it always possible for a given sphere
to find an embedding of a cube with some
orientation in such a way that all
the vertices have the same colour.
Let me, to focus that thought, immediately
make this a little more concrete.
So let's begin by considering
a setting where we have a sphere
where half the surface is red and
half the surface is blue.
I'm going to put no restriction
on how the colors are spread.
But at the end of the day, we want the
following attribute that 50% of the area
of the sphere is red, and 50% is blue.
Given such a sphere,
is it always possible to find
an embedding of a cube inside a sphere
in such a way that every vertex of the
cube, you know there are eight vertices,
every vertex resides on a patch
which is blue in color?
In short, every vertex is blue.
Pause the lecture and think about this.
Play with this for a bit.
Resume when you are ready.
Well, have you thought about it?
What did you find?
Of course, there are orientations where
depending on how you color the sphere, for
example, in bands of red and blue,
where we could find orientations of
the cube where every vertex is blue.
Of course, there are such colorings.
But the question is, is it true for
every coloring of the sphere?
And, in this case, the answer is, no.
A simple example might serve
to convince you that it's
not always going to be possible.
the simplest coloring you could
imagine with this kind of attribute,
where half the sphere is red and
half the sphere is blue
is where there's one hemisphere which is
red, and one hemisphere which is blue.
And I've show, shown you such a sphere
divided into two pieces, the red and
the blue piece.
A little thought will convince you now
that it is impossible in such a case.
For any orientation of
a cube whatsoever to be such
that the entire cube has
got any blue vertices.
For example, a simple Pythagorean
consideration will tell you that
if the sphere has got unit radius, then
the side of the cube must be the square
root of two over three,
approximately 0.81.
And now we can convince you so
that it is not going to be possible,
no matter how much you huff and
puff, to embed a cube
in this sphere in such a way that every
vertex is in the blue hemisphere.
Okay.
What if I increase the amount
of blue on the sphere?
So here's another test case.
What if the sphere now has got 90%
of its surface area covered in blue,
10% covered in red?
I don't prescribe how
the coloring should happen.
Any coloring with 90% blue and 10% red.
given such an arbitrary coloring of
the sphere, is it always possible
to embed a cube in some orientation
in such a way so
that every vertex is blue.
Now pause the lecture, play with it for
a bit, think about it.
Resume when you're ready.
So, this is our question.
We have a sphere,
10% of which is red, 90% is blue.
Of course, the difficulty is I can imagine
settings where it is easy to embed a cube,
so that every vertex is blue.
But the difficulty is figuring out whether
there are some awkward colorings for
which it may not be possible.
Here then,
is a turn in an unexpected direction
in the analysis of such a problem.
In the problem I've given you, there are,
there are no chance
connotations whatsoever.
This is a purely deterministic problem.
You are given a sphere with a certain
coloring, certain ratios of red and blue.
And you're asked to say whether
by dint of careful positioning
you could somehow embed a cube in there
such that all the vertices are blue.
What is so random about that?
There seems to be nothing random at all.
Well, here is a beautiful new idea.
This idea is the principle
of ancillary randomization.
Shoehorning randomization into the problem
in a domain where there was none a priori.
And you would think well,
doesn't that make things worse?
We started with a deterministic setting
and now you've obfuscated the matter,
you've made things random?
Of course there is
a method in the madness.
Here's a new question.
Start with a given sphere,
with a certain coloring 90%
of this sphere is blue, 10% is red.
It's a fixed, but
arbitrary color, start with that.
There is nothing random at this point.
Now, here's what we want to do.
There are many, many, many ways, in fact,
an infinite number of ways in which you
can embed a cube inside a given sphere.
Select an embedding at random.
I'm not going to try make explicit
the sample space of this problem here.
It's clear that the experiment as I'm
imagining it has to have
certain symmetric properties.
Right.
Randomization in the sense that,
roughly speaking,
we're dealing with a uniform
distribution of possibilities.
If you listen to the lectures
of Tablos ex part two,
andthenwe're going to be talking about a
uniform density of a surface of a sphere.
If you haven't, no matter, a,
an intuitive understanding
of what randomization is in
this context will suffice.
Roughly speaking,
all orientations should be equally likely.
Under such settings,
we can postulate an event.
Some orientations may or may not.
End up with all vertices blue.
Look at the collection of cube
orientations where all vertices are blue.
This collection, this set could be empty.
If it's not empty, then it starts
becoming strangely interesting.
Notice in this problem as set up,
I have no apiary guarantee that the set
of interest to me, the set of orientations
where every vertex is blue is not empty.
This is going to be the critical point.
Is that set empty or not?
Now with this of understanding,
let's put in place a little bit of
nomenclature, a little bit of notation.
Just a smidgen.
You've got another cube embedded
randomly inside this given sphere.
Any given vertex may or may not be blue.
Let's tag the vertices,
label them say from one through eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
You've got eight vertices.
For each of the vertices,
let's introduce an event.
These are the bad events.
Let a j be the event, but
the jth vertex is red.
In other words, a1 is the event that
the first of the tagged vertices
happens to have the misfortune
of falling in a red area.
A2 is the event that a second
vertex falls in a red area.
And so on down.
A8 is the event that the eighth labeled
vertex of the cube falls in a red area.
Remember we want all vertices to be blue,
so each of these is bad.
If any of them occurs,
then all vertices are not blue.
So naturally we're interested in the
probability of the union of these events.
But what can we say about
each individual probability?
The randomization,
think about all orientations losing
speaking are equally likely.
The randomization implicit here says
that a probability of a given vertex,
eg red, is proportional to the percentage
of the area of the sphere that is red.
In other words, the probability
that the first vertex is red.
Is 0.1.
Ten percent of the surface area is red.
The probability the second vertex is red?
0.1 Why?
Because there has all
kinds of symmetry here,
each vertex in isolation behaves
like all other vertices.
This is what I mean implicitly by
random selection of orientation.
And so, each of these vertices
individually has a one-tenth chance,
a 10% chance, of landing in a red region.
If any of these events occur,
then something bad has happened.
At least one vertex now will be red.
And therefore, promptly, we talk about a
probability of the union of these events.
And Boole's sieve immediately tells
us that the probability that one or
more vertices is red, one or
more bad events occur,
is no more than 8 times 0.1, or 0.8.
Now nobody in their right minds is
going to look at 0.8 and say well,
that is a small probability.
No, it's actually quite a large
probability, it's near one.
But, and this is a material point,
0.8 is strictly less than one.
What can this say about
the probability of the good event?
That none of the bad events occur,
that only good events occur,
that every vertex is blue, tells us that
this probability must exceed
one minus 0.8 or 0.2.
The probability that no vertex is red,
the probability that
every vertex is blue is at least 20%.
It is not zero, and
what does this tell us?
This tells us that there must exist at
least one orientation of the cube for
this given sphere for
which every vertex is blue.
If this were not true,
if there was no orientation of a cube for
the given sphere for which every
vertex were blue, if that happened,
then the set of orientations for
which every vertex is blue would be empty.
And so
the probability of that set would be zero.
The impossible event has zero probability.
The very fact that a probability of the
set at hand, the probability of the set of
orientations of a cube for which every
vertex is blue, is not zero, it's 0.2.
Though that particular
number is not germane for
our purposes,
all that matters is it is not zero.
It is strictly positive.
That tells you that that
set cannot be empty.
There are orientations of the cube for
a given sphere,
which would make every vertex blue.
Magically almost,
we've deduced a result of existence.
Come on back.
Go back to the start of the problem.
We didn't know if the answer was positive.
We didn't know if it was possible
to embed a cube in a sphere
where 90% of the sphere is blue, 10% red,
in such a way that every vertex was blue.
We didn't know it was possible.
And simple experiments, examples, didn't
lead us closer to a definitive answer,
because there was always the possibility
of a peculiar coloring which resisted
all our blandishments.
No ordering of the cube was going to work.
It was entirely possible that
the set of orientations which worked
was zero, was null.
But now,
our auxiliary randomization tells us,
now there exists at least one orientation.
We proved the existence of an orientation.
Now, this is an amusing,
perhaps, party game.
Through all the data we've got a result,
that was not intuitive,
that was not expected.
And two things leap out at us.
One was, we've done something
different in this experiment.
We started with an experiment where there
was no chance anywhere in view, and we
shoehorned in, we introduced randomization
through auxiliary randomization.
Normally, adding chance elements
just complicates a process.
But in this setting, adding a chance
element creates a solution for a problem.
The idea here, and
this is speaking a little philosophically,
why these approaches worked,
it is because the original problem was
horrible in it's particular detail.
Each individual colouring had
to be analyzed separately.
And the colourings are,
first an infinite in number.
And we could have some
really weird colourings.
You could have possibly exhaust
the space by checking all of them.
What our randomization has done so
cleverly is to symmetrize the problem.
At its heart, mathematics works best,
science works best,
when there are symmetries.
Perhaps it's a limitation
of our human mind that
we react best to patterns that are
visible, to symmetries in the structure.
But in any case,
symmetries allow us to make
an analytical fest of the problem
where otherwise it is intractable.
So this was the high-level idea,
the randomization creates symmetries.
The second idea was that from
these symmetries we could extract
a probabilistic save.
We could extract,
catch in our sieve an orientation and
let all the other rabidly non-working
orientations go, flood out, with a sieve.
So, we have two beautiful Pavo
principles which evolved.
These turn out to be quite subtle and
quite rich, but
as I said, we have other fish to fry.
Boole's sieve by itself works
beautifully in some settings like this.
But not even it's fondest
adherents would say it's precise.
For problems of more delicacy,
we're going to need more delicate sieves.
And we will turn to this next.
