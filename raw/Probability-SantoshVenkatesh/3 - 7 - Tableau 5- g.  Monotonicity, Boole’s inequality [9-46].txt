Monotonicity is the second
of the great pillars in
mathematics together with additivity,
it explains and
makes transparent many,
many, many subtle ideas.
At its heart it looks trite, almost banal.
So here is a basic question.
Suppose you have two events A and B.
Remember, events are subsets
of the sample space.
Suppose additionally
that A is a subset of B.
What can we then say, about
the respective probabilities of A and B?
And actually enough, we want to say that
A has got a smaller probability that B.
And to begin, let's look at a picture.
A picture is always useful as
a device to clarify objects.
Imagine a sample space, an event B and
an event A safely ensconced inside B.
As a first step in the process.
Remember, all we have available to do
our analysis are three [INAUDIBLE].
Positivity, additivity and normalization.
So let's start with the event B.
We can decompose the elements
of B to two types.
If an element is in B,
either that element is in A or
it is not in A, but in B.
In other words, any element of B
is of one of two distinct types.
It must belong to A or
it must belong to B minus A and
so we have an identity.
We have decomposed B to the union of
two disjoint pieces, A and B minus A.
Manifestly, anything in B
minus A cannot be in A.
You have explicitly excluded, eschewed,
all the elements of A in B minus A.
But now, B has been decomposed into
a unit of two disjoint pieces and
additivity immediately tells us that
this probability must be the sum of
the constituent probabilities.
Very good.
But now, let's take a look at
the second term on the right.
The probability of the event B minus A.
The things outside A and
in the analysis between A and B.
Now we don't know much
about this probability,
except that it is a probability.
And the positivity axiom tells
us that whatever this is,
this must be non-negative.
And therefore, on the right-hand side,
you've got the probability of
A added to a non-negative quantity.
If we eliminate,
throw away the non-negative quantity,
it could only decrease the value
of the right-hand side.
And therefore, via the positivity action,
we come to the natural and
again, inevitable conclusion
that if A is a subset of B,
then the probability of A can be no
larger than the probability of B.
All of this really was
a codification of the basic idea.
That the hole is equal
to the sum of its parts.
An immediate consequence of this
is the following observation.
Any event A is a subset of omega.
By definition,
any event has to be a subset.
By monotonicity then,
the probability of any event A cannot
exceed the probability of omega.
But all probabilities are non-negative.
So, in the bookend,
we have inequality zero and
the probability of omega
my normalization is one.
And therefore,
we conclude without further ado,
that all probabilities
are bounded between zero and one.
Again, notice that this is intuitive.
One is tempted to make this a part
of the axiomatic structure, but
it is not necessary.
This is an inevitable
consequence of our spare axioms
of positivity,
normalization and additivity.
Monotonicity looks really trite,
I, I admit.
But it has deep and subtle consequences.
We will see some as we go along,
but let me start by showing
you one identity,
we can churn out using monotonicity.
This is called Boole's inequality.
Their also called the union bound and
the idea is what can you say
about the relative value of
of A union B with respect to
the probabilities of A and B.
So, in this setting, if we have a Venn
diagram, A and B are generic sets.
And so they don't necessarily
have any inclusion relationship,
so you might have some
kind of display like this.
Where A and B live happily in
their own spheres of influence and
they have some overlap.
Now let's begin by looking at A union B.
Now A union B is the sum total of the
elements that are in A or in B or in both.
And to try to use additivity,
we try to find
a decomposition of A union B.
And there are many ways we could do this,
but here is one way.
We can write A union B as A together
with whatever is left out.
And what is left out?
Well, it's that sliver,
that crescent, B minus A.
And therefore, we decompose A union
B as A together with B minus A.
Now by the construction, it is clear
that A and B minus A share no elements.
In other words, the intersection is empty,
they are disjoint sets.
And by construction, it's apparent that
B minus A, that sliver is a subset of B.
That what you've thrown out is,
of course, what is common to A and B,
the intersection of A and B.
Now with these observations
under our belt,
we can immediately write
the probability of A union B,
as the probability of A plus
the probability of B minus A.
This is additivity.
But the probability of B minus A is
no larger than the probability of B,
but monotonicity and we immediately get
a beautiful and elegant inequality.
The probability of A union
B is no larger than
the sum of the probabilities of A and B.
Only experience will teach a student that
simple inequalities like these are more
than worth the price of admission.
Right.
These are much more useful typically than
ponderous and
condition bound in equalities,
which is quiet pages of
work of work to elucidate.
Let's start with this and
immediately see what else we
can do with this kind of idea.
So to begin, we've got Boole's inequality.
The probability union is no larger
than the sum of two probabilities.
What can we say now about the probability
of the union of three elements?
Pause the lecture and
see if you can make headway on this.
Restart when you're ready.
All right.
So, our idea is going to be to try
to decompose A union B, union C.
And we'd like to use what
we already know about
the probability of
the union of two elements.
So let's try the following decomposition.
Group A union B together as one set and
take its union with C.
Of course, we can do unions in
any grouping we like whatsoever.
This is the associative
property of unions, right?
Just like additions,
you can do them in any order you like.
Now on the right, you've got the
probability of the union of two objects.
In drawn brackets, A union B with C.
All right.
Boole's inequality are applied
to these two objects.
Think of A union B standing
in the place of A and
C standing in the place of B and
we write down a sum of two probabilities.
This is just Boole's inequality for
two elements.
But of course, the probability of A union
B we know is no larger than the sum of
the probabilities of A and B.
And immediately, we've got a very
natural looking inequality.
The probability of the union
of three elements is no larger
than the sum of the three
individual probabilities.
What about four?
Well, the argument unfolds in
almost exactly the same way.
Group three of them
together into one unit,
take its,
the unit of that with a fourth unit.
Use Boole's inequality,
write down a sum of two probabilities.
And then for the probability
of a union of three elements,
we already have discovered that
this is no larger than the sum of
three probabilities and
so Bob's your uncle.
There you go.
And of course,
now we see an inductive process at work.
And without further ado,
we can write down the general formula.
The probability of the union of N events,
however they're constituted
is no larger than the sum of
the individual probabilities.
Again, this is a political age, so
we need a slogan to keep us going.
So here's our slogan.
The probability of a union of events
is no larger than the sum of the event
probabilities.
This is the quantitative
rules in equality,
also called the union bound for
natural reasons.
