We have now come to our right
understanding of the concept
of chance experiments in the continuum
in one and more dimensions.
It is now time to test our grasp
of the concepts, and see if we can
extend this to something which is more
generic, more broadly applicable.
So, to begin.
I'm going to give you a sample function,
p,
in two dimensions, p of x,
y of the given form.
Is it a density?
Pause the lecture and have a go at it.
Come back when you are ready.
Sketching pictures gets more complex
when the number of dimensions increases,
but with two dimensions we can
still make a good fist of fit.
if you have access to a good
plotting routine or a symbolic
manipulation program, you can plot what
this function looks like and if you do.
This is what it looks like.
It actually does looks like
a generic bell, and that reminds us
of faint activistic talk to our memory
of the normal density, the bell curve.
Maybe there is a connection,
and indeed there is.
Now, to verify the prominence of this
function of a possible density we are to
check two things.
Positivity and normalization.
Positivity is trite.
Why?
Because exponential function is strictly
positive everywhere so
it never becomes negative.
And our question then becomes, is this
thing properly normalized to unit area?
Now, it's going to be clear
that the integral converges.
Why?
Because the exponential function decays so
absurdly fast.
So the question now is, have I got
the normalizing constants right?
So, without further ado,
let's set up a two-dimensional
integral off the given function.
All right, we look at this and say, okay,
the usual course of things when one is
called upon to try to evaluate
a two-dimensional integral,
we naturally try to do it iteratively,
first one integral, and then the other.
George would say,
when you have two things to say,
say first the first thing,
and then the second thing.
Naturally we want to do things
in an iterative fashion.
Now to do this,
we want to take the function and
try to split it up into the influence
of x and the influence of y.
And an examining of the particular
form of the intergram tells us how
we can go about doing this.
There's a factor two pi the denominator.
We'll split up the two terms
each square root of two pi.
And then the exponential breaks up
naturally into a product of exponentials.
And now is a product of a function
of x and a function of y.
And these functions look
strangely familiar.
And indeed of course they are.
Each of them is exactly the normal
density, the bell curve,
the function we called phi,
following Gauss's notation.
And so, the first term in the integrand
is just phi evaluated at x.
The second term in the integrand
is phi evaluated at y.
And now we can simply separate the double
integral into a product of two integrals.
One involving the integral fi of x,
the other for a different variable,
the integral of fi of y.
But remember fi was a normal density.
No further work is needed.
We've already done the hard work.
The normal density is
a density in one dimension.
And therefore it's positive, and
critically it integrates to unit.
And therefore each of these two
integrals is identically one.
And therefore we get one times one,
or one.
And this two dimensional function is
positive and indeed properly normalized.
And now we recognize its providence.
This is an example of a two
dimensional normal density,
a two dimensional bell curve.
All right, a general verification
will proceed upon these lines.
Though of course, the difficulty of
verification will depend upon how
complete the function is, and how hard
it is to do a particular integration.
But the basic ideas are clear.
Now, what made this
particular construction work?
But here is the key idea.
The function I've given you decomposes
into a product of two functions,
each of which is a density.
That immediately gives rise to an idea for
a general construction in
any number of dimensions.
And so here without further ado,
is the assertion.
Suppose I'm dealing with
an n-dimensional sample space.
And suppose that each of the trials
is controlled by, determined by,
various density functions which don't
have to be the same from trial to trial.
Right?
You know, the,
the discrete analogue is of throwing dice
where each die is differently weighted.
In principle,
one could imagine such an experiment.
Suppose we have a sequence of
one-dimensional densities.
Let's call them p1 after variable x1.
P2 is another function, possibly,
of the variable X2 and so on.
PN is a function of a variable XN.
Each of these is a one
dimensional density.
In other words each of these functions
is positive and integrates to one.
The claim now is, if we simply
multiply all these functions,.
Well naturally we now get a function
of invariables, call it p.
This function of invariables
separates into a product
of one dimensional densities.
The claim now is that if we do this,
for any choice of
the constituent densities p1 through pn,
we will get a density in end dimensions.
The verification now is completely trite,
right?
Let's write it down, if you have densities
in one dimension, if you multiply them
you're going to get a positive function
in n-dimensions, no problem there.
The question is, normalization as always.
What is the n-dimensional
integral of this product?
Well, we simply separate out the terms and
multiply out one.
Dimensional integral
letter time n of them.
Now each of these one dimensional integral
is the area under the curve of a one
dimensional density.
By definition, each of those areas must
be properly normalized to unit and
therefore each of the terms of
the right must be exactly one.
Without any further computation.
And you get a product of ones,
and inevitably you'll get one.
So the product of N one
dimensional densities,
in fact gives you
a density in N dimensions.
We should conclude with a slogan.
The product of densities is a density.
Okay.
At the heart of this construction is
this key idea of multiplying densities.
This is a fundamental key principle behind
this concept of statistical independence.
Independence is a skein, this thread which
runs right through the theory of chance.
But I'm getting ahead of myself,
we'll come back to this in a few lectures.
