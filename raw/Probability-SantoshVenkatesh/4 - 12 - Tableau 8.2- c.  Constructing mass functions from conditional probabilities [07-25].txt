One of the things that might trouble,
a student is that,
a probability measure,
perhaps for the first time,
specified implicitly,
via probabilities acting on events.
How does one construct and
measure, overall for the problem.
In other words, here's a discrete problem,
a finite problem.
There are only,
a finite number of possible outcomes for
this idealized experiment.
How does one specify a probability
measure for the problem?
Well, naturally enough,
I specify a mass function.
How does one specify a mass function,
than for this problem?
In other words, how doesn't specify,
atomic probabilities for this problem?
All right.
So let's take a small digression,
make sure
that this kind of implicit specification,
does not lose any generality, right?
So let us, see how we can go about
constructing, an atomic probability.
And therefore, a mass function for
the problem at hand.
Figure these implicit,
conditional probabilities.
So, let's start a new.
So again, where you have a sample space,
the events of interest, and
our implicit, probability measure,
via the conditional probabilities.
We now want, various atomic probabilities.
Well, let's pick the target one at hand,
that, the,
die chosen was die one, with five
red faces and white, one white face,
that it was thrown twice, and
that two red faces occurred.
The sample point corresponding to this,
the atom,
corresponds to the triple 1,
die 1 has chosen.
R1, that the first throw is red,
R2 the second throw is red.
Now, this tells us that,
this event, this atom,
the singleton is obtained,
by the conjunction of three events.
First, die 1 has to be chosen,
event A has to occur.
Two, the first throw of the die has
to be red, the event R1 has to occur.
And finally,
the second throw of that die, has to
be a red, the event R2 has to occur.
And therefore, the atom 1,
R, R is equivalent,
to the conjunction,
the intersection of the events A, R1,
and R2.
All right, so now,
we have a conjunction problem.
How do we compute this?
Well, the moment we have intersections,
we can think of chaining them.
We are, conditional probabilities,
and additivity.
In this setting, R1 intersection R2,
stands for each in our definition.
And, by writing down the definition
of conditional probability, we find,
that the probability of the, of atom 1,
Red, Red,
is given by the conditional probability,
of the two throws being red,
given that, die 1 is selected.
Times the probability
that die 1 is selected.
And now, implicit specification,
writes to our rescue.
We write down the fractions.
And we find the chance,
of this atom, is 25 and 72.
Let's look at one more example,
to settle concepts.
What is the chance that the atom,
corresponding to the triple, for
which, die 2 is selected,
the die with five white faces and
one red face, that the first throw
of that die results in a red face,
and the second throw of that
die results in a white face.
Now, this triple corresponds to,
the joint occurrence of the event,
that die 2 was chosen
A compliment,
that its first throw was a red R1,
and its second throw was white,
the complement of R2.
And now we've got another system
of conjunction probabilities.
We'd write down the definition
of conditional probability,
where now, R1 intersection,
R2 complement, stands in the role of H.
[NOISE] Now what is a conditional
probability of R1 intersection,
R2 complement?
Given, a complement.
[NOISE] Now think about this for a moment.
Die 2 has been selected.
R1 means, the first throw was a red,
but there's only one way,
is which a red face can occur, for die 2.
R2 complement, means that
the second throw, was a white face.
But, there are five possibilities for
the white face, and
therefore, overall,
there is 1 times 5, or 5 ways,
in which for die 2 a red face
could be followed by a white face.
Out of how many possibilities?
36.
And therefore, you have 5 over 36.
Representing the conditional
probability of R1 intersection,
R2 complement, given a complement.
The probability rate complement,
is one and two.
And therefore,
we find that the probability of the atom,
corresponding to the selection of die 2.
First for being red, second for
being white, is 5 and 72.
Now write down for yourself,
all the other atomic probabilities.
You'll first have to identify,
all the atoms in the system.
All the idealized outcomes explicitly, and
then run through calculations
along very similar lines.
Pause.
Do this to settle concepts.
And then restart the lecture,
when you are ready.
Here now, is a final table,
of the atomic probabilities.
First, how many possibilities are there?
Well there are two possibilities for
the first element, one or two.
There are two possibilities for
the second element, red or white.
There are two possibilities for
the third element, red or white.
There are 2, times 2, times 2, or
8 possibilities for the sample space.
In this sample space you
have 8 sample points, and
then each of these now, has
the probabilities listed on your right.
You should verify, that we actually
have a bona fide mass function.
Remember, it's supposed to stand for,
a probability measure.
It's got to be, non-negative,
that is patent.
And it has to add to 1,
the key property of normalization.
As a sanity check, add up the column,
and verify that in fact, you get 1.
Things are in fact, properly normalized.
Of course, on closer examination, you'll
find there are all kinds of symmetry,
in this problem, and that's because of
the way I set up the problem, right.
You, the die are in some sense,
mirror images of each other.
Our next example is going to be,
a little more subtle.
And, perhaps, a little more intriguing.
