Let us first turn to the probability
that an accused individual is actually
convicted by a 12 member jury.
In notation,
we want a probability of the event C.
Naturally enough,
we look to decompose the problem,
and a natural partition
is immediately suggested.
Based upon whether the individual
is guilty or innocent.
And therefore by conditioning
on whether they are guilty or
innocent, we can simply decompose
the probability of conviction.
Of course, the less now will recognize and
appeal to the theorem
of total probability.
Additivity has come to the fore.
The moment you write such an expression
down, it now becomes almost transparent.
The probability of guilt is just
the probability that the indicator
Z of guilt is 1.
But if,
the person is guilty then conviction
occurs if the number of juror
errors does not exceed 5.
Jury decisions are independent of guilt or
independence and
therefore now we have the first term.
The probability that as 12 doesn't exceed
5, times the probability of guilt.
The second term, likewise, if
the individual is innocent, then Z is 0.
And, if the individual is innocent,
conviction occurs, if and
only if the number of juror errors is 7 or
more.
Again, jury decisions are independent
of guilt or innocence.
And now we're all set because we
know that Z is a Bernoulli variable.
It's got a probability theta of success,
a probability 1 minus theta of failure.
And as 12 is a binomial variable,
what parameter's 12,
the number of trials,
the number of jurors.
And success probability p,
the probability a juror makes an error.
And so we simply by ductility,
accumulate binomial probabilities and
write down an expression.
The first term, the first sum tells
you the probability of making 5 or
fewer juror errors.
The second sum is, catches the probability
of 7 of more juror errors,
in the two cases of guilt and innocence.
Now, of course, we could expand
out the binomial probabilities,
the atomic probabilities in terms of
the binomial coefficients, and so on.
But that is not necessary for our purposes
at this time, we could always go back and
put in place the algebra at need.
We could stop here and say well we
have done the problem, it's done.
This is in fact the answer.
And we could numerically compute this,
there is no argument.
But a little bit of algebraic massaging
allows us to put this into a nice and
compact form, which also has got
a certain amount of intrusion baked in.
And to do this, we're going to try
to merge the two sums together.
So, let's begin by looking at the binomial
probabilities in the second sum out.
B 12 of k and p.
The probability that in
12 tosses of a coin with
success probability p,
one gets k successes.
Now, let's write down the binomial
formulation for this.
What does it say?
It said the binomial probability is
going to be given by 12 choose k.
Times success probability
p to the power k,
times failure probability 1 minus p,
to the power 12 minus k.
Let's do a little bit of massaging first.
First, to the binomial coefficient, and
then the two terms of
the product adjacent to it.
Now, selecting k from 12 is exactly
the same as selecting 12 minus k from 12.
The moment 1 selects k,
1 leaves side 12 minus k.
It is equivalent to
specifying that 12 minus k.
And therefore, we have two versions
of the same binomial coefficient.
They're both completely
equal to each other.
And let us play the following little,
apparently trivial game,
exchange the order of the two terms
of the product, p to the k and
1 minus b to the power 12
minus k as I've shown you.
Now it looks like I
haven't done very much.
But an examination of
the expression on the right
shows us that we've got
another binomial formulation.
This is a binomial probability
that in 12 tosses of
a coin who's success
probability is 1 minus p
that one attains exactly
12 minus k successes.
And therefore,
we identify this exactly with B 12
of 12 minus k,
with a success probability of 1 minus p.
All this took was
a rearrangement of terms.
And we have this beautiful
little symmetry.
Let's rewrite our expression now,
using this identity.
And so now we've got a first term,
and a second term,
in terms of the binomial probabilities,
evaluated at 12 minus k, and
a success probability of 1 minus p.
Let's take a good hard
look at the second sum.
K runs from 7 through 12.
As k runs from 7 through 12,
12 minus k runs between 0 and 5.
And so,
if we replace 12 minus k by k, then,
it is equal to asking k
to run from 0 through 5.
And so we could simply rewrite the sum
as follows, is some k running 0 through
5 of the binomial probabilities of
corresponding to 12 tosses of a coin,
evaluated at k, and
success probability of 1 minus p.
Right.
So
all we've done is a completely
transparent thing here.
Replace 12 minus k by k, and then when 12,
and when k was, the original
sum was running from 7 through 12, in
the new sum, k would run from 0 through 5.
That is all would say.
Nothing has changed in the sum.
But now, of course,
the two sums on the right are running
where exactly the same range.
Addition is associative.
We can do it in any order we like.
Let's pull the terms together and
pull the summation out and
put everything else in square
brackets in the middle.
And there you go, a nice and
simple, and compact expression.
Having done the work, we should
see if there's any intrusion here.
Whether there's some reason to believe it.
And indeed, of course, there is.
The term in the square brackets
connotes exactly the probability
that the defendant is
convicted when the dissenting
minority has got exactly k votes,
k running from 0 through 5.
Of course this means that
the majority has got 12 minus
k of at least 7 votes to convict.
Here's a nice and simple, and
clean compact expression.
Of course one can numerically evaluate
this if one knew theta and p.
But, let's hold onto that for a moment.
And move to the next question.
'Kay.
So, this is one step in our road.
The deeper question of course,
is the question of errors.
We come to that next.
