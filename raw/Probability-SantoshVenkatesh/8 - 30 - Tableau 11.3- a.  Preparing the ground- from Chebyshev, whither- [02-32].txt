Tableau 11,
the fabulous limit laws, part 3.
The bell curve fits in,
why polls really work.
And so
we have come to the end of this repast.
Well, of the main course at least.
The magisterial law of large numbers
that we have seen is in many ways,
the most intuitive part of the theory,
that which is most in accordance
with our native intuition.
And yet, as we have seen,
there are unexpected eddies,
little subtleties which
are not apparent to the eye.
A prosaic, even dull,
application of Chebyshev's inequality
is already potent in this context.
We have seen, immediately, that it
gives us a principle to mathematical
justification for
the validity of pulling mechanisms, for
drug testing, and even for
probabilistic computing.
And yet, the sample
size estimates that derive from this naive
application of Chebyshev's inequality
are still a little too large for comfort.
Even its originator would not claim
that the inequality is tight.
And so, a natural attempt at improving
the results is to start with
Chebyshev's basic inequality and
see whether it can be improved, tightened.
This is a very fertile field of endeavor.
And in the century and a half since
inequality first made its appearance,
it has devolved into subtle and
deep inequalities,
exponential inequalities and concentration
ideas which are current to this very day.
This is indeed a potent and
powerful way forward.
But, we shall take a different tack,
and in fact,
we'll go back to the dawns of
the calculus, about four centuries ago.
And a remarkable,
unlooked for, serendipitous
idea that emerged in full bloom from
apparently a barren desert of ideas.
This was the remarkable bell curve.
