Summary of tableau five.
Towards an axiomatic
theory of probability,
the abstract probability space.
In moving to an axiomatic framework,
we identified three fundamental elements
which underlie games of chance.
The first, the identification
of the sample space omega,
which is the conceptual
space of all possible,
conceivable outcomes, of a thought
experiment, a gedanken experiment.
This was the object
identified by formices, and
it's a starting point in
a probabilistic endeavor.
Identifying what this
piece of possibilities is.
The second element, the idea of an event
as a subset of idealized outcomes,
a subset of the sample space.
The collection of events
forms an algebra of events.
Whereas with an ordinary algebra,
we can massage objects
using unions, intersections,
set differences, and complements.
And the third and final element,
the assignment of a probability measure.
A set function to events.
Now, the idea of a probability
measure is complicated on the surface.
If it is to fit in with our understanding
of probability intuitively,
it must satisfy.
We must ascribe to it three axioms.
The axiom of positivity,
the axiom of normalisation, and
the axiom of additivity.
But this is a very complicated object.
This is not our grandfather's function.
It's a set function.
It's complex.
Its arguments are sets.
And all these interrelationships within
events are difficult to keep track of,
especially in large spaces.
So, an actual question then is how does
one construct probability measure?
We shall come to this, okay?
Ideally of course, our constructions
will reflect an intuitive reality.
The feeling we have that if we perform
a chance experiment independently,
repeatedly, then the frequency
of occurrence of an event
should be reflected in this probability.
And indeed, we'll find in accumulating
lectures that this in fact is the case.
And this establishes the,
the framework for
why we believe in such a theory of chance.
Now, from an abstract point of view, this
axiomatic structure immediately gives us
certain low-hanging fruit,
simple consequences.
And these, we should have under our belts.
First, the empty set
has got 0 probability.
An immediate consequence of this is that
probabilities are bounded between 0 and 1.
The book-end, 0 for the empty set,
and 1 for the sample space.
Monotonicity, the key and
important property,
is also an immediate consequence.
If two sets of events satisfy
an inclusion relationships,
then the probability will follow
in the natural direction.
A consequence of this is
the subtle inequality of Boole.
The probability of a union
of events is no larger
than the sum of
the individual probabilities.
Additivity comes to the floor again
when you talk about partitions.
If we partition the sample
space into disjoint elements,
then the sum of the probabilities
of those elements must be one.
And, a consequence of this is this i,
identity inclusion and
exclusion, which connects
the probabilities of disjunctions or
unions on one hand, to the probabilities
of intersections on the other.
Now, before we move on,
these basic ideas are so
important that we should
really take stalk.
All right, bear in mind that the key,
key elements here are three in number.
The sample space, the algebra of events,
and the probability measure.
One experience has taught me that when
a student who is new to the subject is
confronted with a problem,
her first reaction is to scramble around,
look for a formula.
Something you can plug in, something,
and get an answer quickly.
This is usually ill advised.
The first step in a problem in chance
always involves the following idea.
Can you identify the chance
elements of the problem at hand?
Here is the acid test for
whether you can identify these.
If you tell me, here is a putative
sample point or idealized outcome for,
of the experiment, then the moment
that sample point is identified,
there can be no residual uncertainty
as to what happened in the experiment.
To make this concrete, imagine
an experiment where one throws two dice.
Well, what are the outcomes?
If one were to say, and cautiously, that
the outcome is a number from one through
six, that leaves a lot
of things uncertain.
Which die are we talking about?
And probably,
what happened to the other die?
To come to a right understanding
of what really happened,
one will have to specify what
happened to each of the two dice.
What has to happen then a convention for
describing what we mean.
So for example, you could say
a pair of numbers, three and six.
Meaning that the die,
which is color red, showed three.
The die, which is color white, showed six.
There's a convention here, a dictionary of
translation which is established ahead of
time, which explains
what the conventions are.
And at, at the end of the day,
a pair like three, comma,
six tells us exactly what happened
when one threw those two dice.
This is our acid test,
when you specify the sample points,
when you specify the sample space.
The moment one specifies a sample point,
there can be no residual uncertainty
in what happened in the experiment.
Of course, there are many
different ways then of specifying,
in notation, complex experiments.
Pick one.
Once you have this under your belt,
you know have a representation for
these idealized outcomes for
these sample points.
Identify the key events of interest.
And bear in mind that an event must
per force, be a subcollection,
a subset of the sample
points you've identified.
If one cannot identify exactly
the subset under discussion,
then one is already in deep hot water.
One doesn't know what the object is for
which you're going to
ascribe a probability.
And of course,
we can only expect that bad things will
come out of such a lack of coherence.
So, the second step has to be, once you
identified the sample space as a set,
which subsets of that space
are interesting for our problem?
These are the events at hand.
And the third and final step, of course,
is to ascribe to the events of interest
a probability which satisfies
the basic axioms of probability.
So, our next step would be to say,
well, how does one construct
probability measure?
This looks like a very complex and
complicated object.
It is a set function, for crying out loud.
And of course,
we turn to elementary examples for
which we have a lot of intuition
to see how we might proceed.
This is the subject of our next tableau.
