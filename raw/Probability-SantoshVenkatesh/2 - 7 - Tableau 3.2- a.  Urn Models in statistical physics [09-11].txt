Tableau three, part two,
urn models in statistical physics.
The casual listener might find
this a strange juxtaposition.
Commonplace problems,
on the one hand, and the strange world
of statistical physics on the other.
But of course, in the 21st century,
we've come to casual familiarity
with strange objects,
denizens from the world of physics,
which appear in the popular literature,
in the popular press.
Now, in the previous tableau,
we concluded with
a view of how simple ball and
urn models, appear in commonplace
problems involving the throwing of a die,
or the repeated toss of a coin.
In today's lecture, we shall see how
small variance on this urn theme
apply to very fundamental and
deep problems in physics.
This is a dangerous bend lecture.
And the reader who is anxious
to get on with the res gestae,
to the main course as it where,
could skip this tableau and
move onto the next part without
any loss of continuity.
But, for the reader who's curious
about modern day physics and
the rule chance plays in it, listen on.
There are few places in modern life
where we see such large assemblages
of particles as in particle physics.
In the 19th century,
physics was viewed very mechanistically.
There were determined laws which
had been given to us by Newton, and
physical systems invariably
followed those laws.
But late in the 19th century,
with a growing evidence for
particulate behavior, there was a,
a stream of thought which
created a statistical or
a probabilistic understanding of
how physical particles behaved.
The spearhead for this kind of ideas was
Ludwig Walsman, who on the end of the 19th
century, postulated a theory
of statistical mechanics.
This was not widely accepted.
But, this was the beginnings of
a theory which informed much
of 20th century physics.
Now in this world we find that there
are particles, a large number of them,
milling around without
a priori determined outcomes.
How does one describe such a world?
What is an appropriate model?
Of course today, the listener
would have encountered strange and
exotic particles of all kinds.
Perhaps mesons, gluons, the weak and
the strong nuclear forces, photons.
The higs goes on.
Now, these particles appear
in various strange forms,
in exotic colors, for example,
the fundamental quarks,
which appear in many flavors up and
down, strange, charm.
All these led color to
a rather complicated story.
But of course,
if one looks at this in full generality,
as it were,
it becomes extraordinarily hard to model.
Now, remarkably, at the heart of
all of these apparently complex and
diverse kinds of particular behavior,
are very, very,
very simple chance models, involving
variations on a theme on balls and urns.
So, let us get to the heart of
the problem, and describe, shown
of all physical color, what
the essential mathematical problem is.
So we begin with an assemblage,
and in your mind, you should
think of a very large assemblage,
of a large number of particles.
Inevitably, we call them n in number.
These particles come equipped
with certain characteristics.
What are called the states
of the particles.
For example, where they're located,
their physical positioning,
perhaps the momentum, their spin.
These characteristics describe
the state of the particle.
For deafedness, think about this as,
let's say, a physical position.
Though it could be more complex than that.
One of the great discoveries in early
20th century physics was that these
fundamental attributes of particles
were quantized,they were discretize,
a finite in number.
Which meant that particles occupied
only a finite number of states.
And inevitably in our context,
we think of those states as urns,
receptacles, that particles could land in.
And so now we have the beginnings
of an unfolding picture.
A large number of particles in and
a set of urns,
states to which they could belong,
they could be assigned.
And now we have a ball and urn problem.
Now what is chance driven here?
And this was Boltzmann's insight.
Perhaps the best way to think about
assemblages of particles like these is to
imagine that they are distributed in
the states in the urns at random.
We have the beginnings of
a chance driven phenomenon.
The moment you distribute particles,
balls in these urns.
Now what is material?
What is salient?
Is which urns are occupied and
how many balls are in those urns?
How many of those particles share
a particular characteristic?
This leads the idea of
an occupancy number.
So, the way you are going to
think about this is as follows.
Imagine that we list the urns from
left to right one, two, three, four,
five up through r.
These are a possible states
of your physical system.
Distribute the balls in these
urns by some random mechanism.
And then simply count how many
balls are in the first urn?
Well, we need to give is a name, a number,
this is the essential purpose of notation.
Let's call them k1 balls in the first urn.
And then there are certain number
of balls in the second urn.
How many?
Well, inevitably, k2 in number k3 in the
third urn and say k sub r in the rth urn.
These numbers k represent
the occupancy of these urns.
Of course occupancy numbers
must be non-negative.
You clearly can't have a negative
occupancy in an urn and they must
add up to the total number of balls in
the system, the total number of particles.
Good.
Now, here is the million dollar question.
You've got a chance
distribution of these balls and
occupancy configuration is
a sequence of r occupancies.
The occupancies of each of these urns, and
occupancy configuration could be realized
by many different designments
of balls to urns.
For example, if the first urn has got
two balls, it could have the third and
the seventh ball, or the millionth and
the billionth balls.
As far as occupancy is concerned,
it does not matter which.
And so an occupancy configuration is
an aggregate of possible outcomes.
It is an event.
A chance event in this
chance driven problem.
And the moment we have a chance event, a
natural question, the inevitable question
is, what are the chances?
So, given a random placement of n balls,
n particles into r urns,
r states and given a particular occupancy
configuration of interest to us,
say a particular sequence k1,
k2, k3 through k sub r.
What are the chances?
What is the probability P of k1 through kr
that you observe that particular
occupancy configuration?
This particular problem is at
the heart of statistical physics.
We shall approach this from
a historical context in three syllabus.
Which will start with a classical
description or model and
then work out what we have to do
to modify it to fit the facts.
And that'll lead us to the two modern
versions of this occupancy problem.
