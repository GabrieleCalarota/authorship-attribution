What lessons can be deduce from chance and
common place settings?
To being,
we start with a discrete sample space.
This is space which is either finite or
alternatively, infinite.
We could via dictionary of translation,
identify the sample points of
such an experiment, either with
natural numbers or with integers.
It'll turn out,
it'll transpire that in many settings,
the particular name we give
a sample point is of little matter.
What matters are its chance connotations.
And therefore, in many settings, it'll be
preferable to make the problem antiseptic
and simply identify conceptual
outcomes sample points with integers.
So we start we start with
a discrete sample space.
Given a discrete sample space,
the first item of business in constructing
a probability measure is to
identify atomic probabilities.
We start with elementary
events called Atoms,
which consist of singleton events, events
consisting of a single sample point,
and to each such sample point,
say omega k,
to the corresponding atom,
we allocate a probability.
An atomic probability, of course,
this will only depend upon the particular
sample point under consideration.
Say the k is sample point, and
therefore let us call the atomic
probability attached to
the sample point omega k,
p of k; where we use a lower case p
to denote an ordinary function
of an integer argument.
Now, what do we need from
these atomic probabilities?
Well, manifestly,
they are probabilities and
therefore, they have to
satisfy positivity and
furthermore, these probabilities
have to satisfy normalisation.
They have to add to 1.
So, we start with atomic probabilities
which are positive and add to 1.
Now, how do we go about constructing
event probabilities in general?
Well, we start with any event,
and we can think of an event
in a discrete space as being the union
of a discrete set of atoms and
so, manifestly,
if a probability is to be designed at all,
it must be given by
a sum of probabilities.
How do we go about doing this?
Well, the notation on the screen
says sum over all the sample
points inside that event, the probability
of the corresponding atoms.
If the event a at the consideration
consists of, let us say,
generically the k1 example point,
the k2 example point,
the k3 example point and so on.
For example, the second sample point, the
fifth sample point, the 19th sample point.
Then one would simply add the
probabilities of the atoms corresponding
to second, the fifth,
the 19th, and so forth.
This of course we realize is
our third fundamental axiom,
the axiom of additivity.
Let us now summarize what this means for
our purposes.
So to characterize chance in
a discrete setting we begin first
by identifying atoms,
singleton events in the space.
And our fundamental realization
is that in discrete spaces,
atoms are the carriers of mass.
Notice we are very freely borrowing
from the language of physics.
Now how do we go about allocating mass?
Well, to each atom, let's the k of atom,
we allocate a probability p of k.
The atomic probabilities determine
a function, P of an integer.
We call this a game borrowing
from the language of physics,
a mass function or a distribution.
This function must satisfy the key
axioms of positivity and normalisation.
Given such a mass function, how do we
go about constructing probabilities.
Well, very simply.
The probability measure allocates
to any particular subset,
any particular event in
the sample space a probability.
Obtained by summing the atomic
probabilities corresponding to that event.
The whole is manifestly,
the sum of it's distinguished parts.
Very simple, very clean.
At this point,
it becomes clear that in a discrete space,
the experiment can be captured in a very,
very simple way, all right.
Now this is a political age and
therefore we need some slogans
to go along with our course.
So, here's our slogan.
Any honest mass function p of k,
the final datages,
induces a discrete probability measure for
some space.
What is an honest mass function or
honest distribution?
Well, what makes it honest
is that it satisfies
the fundamental axioms of positivity and
normalisation.
With such a mass function in hand,
all we do to construct probabilities is
simply add up atomic probabilities for
the event at hand.
