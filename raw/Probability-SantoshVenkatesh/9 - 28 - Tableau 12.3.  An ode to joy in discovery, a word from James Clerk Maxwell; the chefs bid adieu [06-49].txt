Wow.
The eight weeks have flown by.
And in this time, I've tried to give you,
a sense of the,
wonder that infuses the subject.
From the mathematical foundations,
to the glorious vistas of applications.
But it is certain true that at
the end of a long sequence,
a compressed sequence like this.
That you start feeling a sense of ennui,
a sense of weariness when the equations
appear more and more drab and duller.
It is easy to lose that
sense of childlike wonder
that John Keats spoke about when he
first encountered Chapman's Homer.
Then felt I,
like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken.
Is there code for wonder and joy in
science, in mathematics, in technology?
Assuredly, there is and I am going
to leave you with a whimsical word
on the importance of joyous discovery,
of exhilarating search,
of fun in the enterprise, and
this is from James Clerk Maxwell.
Perhaps the greatest scientist in
the link between Newton and Einstein.
But Maxwell was more
than just a scientist.
He had an impish sense of fun and
this permeates all his writings and
in many ways makes his discoveries
even feel more magical.
So I need to set the stage for
you for this poem.
This is in the best traditions
of Victorian parody,
of Victorian light verse.
The setting was immediately after
the Napoleonic wars had ravaged Europe.
The time was between 1857 and 1867,
in the middle of the 19th century,
and the setting was
the laying of a trans-Atlantic cable
connecting Europe to the Americas.
This project was prodigious
in it's difficulty.
2,500 miles of cable had to be laid.
Enormous technological
problems had to be solved.
And one of the chief architects of
this project was William Thompson,
who later became Lord Kelvin.
I'm not going to take this tempting
alleyway to tell you about this project.
It's a beautiful story in it's own right,
but one of the myriads of
technical problems that had to be solved
was the following very simple observation.
If you send an electrical
signal 2,500 miles underwater,
through a cable, then by the time
it reaches it's destination,
it is going to be severely attenuated.
How does one detect a signal which is so
attenuated?
The current detectors that
were available at that time,
called Deschanel galvanometers,
were quite unequipped for this task.
And Thompson turned his
redoubtable mind to it and
he invented a new current detector,
a galvanometer.
In which he replaced
a needle by a beam of light.
And he showed it to Maxwell.
And Maxwell was enraptured.
And he felt moved to write a poem
of the glories of this discovery.
This is one of two poems he wrote
called Lectures to Women in
the Physical Sciences.
You must remember the time
was late 19th century.
And this one is an Ode to a Galvanometer.
And I'm going to recite this for
you to communicate the joy and
discovery, the fun that Maxwell
felt in scientific discovery.
So, this is the part Thompson's
mirror galvanometer.
The setting is a dark room, a small room,
an alcove perhaps with blackened curtains.
A little beam of light is playing in.
And he has an audience of one.
And so, here we go.
Ode to a Galvanometer.
The lamplight falls on blackened walls,
and streams through narrow perforations.
The long beam plays o'er pasteboard
scales with slow decaying oscillations.
Flow, current, flow,
set the quick light spot flying.
Flow current, answer light spot.
Flashing, quivering, dying.
Oh look, how queer, how thin and clear,
and thinner, clearer, sharper growing.
The guiding fire with central wire.
The fine degrees distinctly show it.
Swing magnet, swing.
Advancing and receding.
Swing magnet.
Answer dearest, what is the final reading?
Oh love, you failed to read the scale.
Correct to tense of a division,
to mirror heaven,
those eyes were given, and
not for methods of precision.
Break contact, break,
set the free light spot fly.
Break contact, rest the magnet,
swinging, creeping, dying.
I'd like to leave you with
Maxwell's exhortations
on finding science in discovery.
I wish you joyous discovery,
exhilarating searches as you sift
through zephyrs of possibility.
At the end I have been a figure head for
this class.
The work which has brought this entire
splendid set of video lectures to
you has been done by the chefs that have
been laboring mightily in the background.
I invite you to listen to them bid
you adieu, and joyous discovery.
>> Thank you, Professor.
We hope you enjoyed dining with us,
and come again soon.
Here's the rest of the crew.
>> Thank you for all the effort that
you put in this course, and please.
>> Hi guys.
You made it this far.
As Franklin Roosevelt once said, you've
dared greatly, you've been bloodied,
you've been in the arena,
and you came out stronger.
Congratulations.
See you next time.
>> Hello guys.
I'm almost sure that you have enjoyed
this course with the legendary Professor.
Stay tuned for future courses.

>> Bye.
