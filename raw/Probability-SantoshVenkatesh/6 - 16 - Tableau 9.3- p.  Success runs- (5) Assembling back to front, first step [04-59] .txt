Let's take stock now.
Remember, we wanted to
compute the probabilities sn.
And we determined as our fist slogan that
if we know the f's then we know the s'.
We punted the ball down field and
said, well, to compute the fs.
If we know the u's then
we can compute the f's.
And now to compute the u's we say
if know the early values of u then
I can compute the later values of u.
Okay, now it's a question
of simply assembly.
There's nothing particularly
a defying about the assembly.
All right.
This is algebraic, and if we get the
numbers together and see where they go.
But at the end of the day a beautiful
story is going to emerge,
like a butterfly from a chrysalis.
So, bear with me, and
we'll go step by step.
So, our first order of business is
to compute the probabilities u n.
For every value of the index n,
where u n represents the probability that
there is a success run of length
five which is at trial n.
Now, here's what we know
as our boundary conditions.
You cannot have a success run of length
five terminating in the first four trials,
so u1 through u4 are manifestly 0.
What about u5.
Well we know what u5 is but
let us test our formulas and
we've got a formula sitting above,
above us.
Let's plug it in with n equal to 5.
And if you plug in n equal
to 5 we get an expression
on the right which is 2 to the power
of minus 5 from which you subtract away
terms involving u1 through u4,
but u1 through u4 are all 0.
They all vanish quietly,
like the snows of the yester year.
And what remains is simply
2 to the power minus 5.
What about u6?
Plug in n equal to 6.
And now we've got an expression on the
right, which is 2 to the power minus 5.
From which you take away various
terms from u2 through u5.
Well, but u2 through u4 are 0,
they vanish,
u5 as we've just discovered
is 2 to the power minus 5.
In consonance with an immediate and
direct analysis.
And therefore u6 is 2 to the power
minus 5 from which you take away 2 to
the power minus 6 and
an elementary reassembly and
factorization shows us that this
is exactly 2 to the power minus 6.
There's only about a one in 64 chance
that you get a success run
occurring on the sixth trial.
What about u7?
Just one more, to, to fix ideas.
Put an n equal to 7 in there,
work your way through,
the only terms that survive on
the right are from u5 and u6.
But we've already covered these values in
the previous step and that's the essence
of a recursive argument, plug those in and
we find u7 is also to the power minus 6.
You might want to give this
a little thought, why are u6 and
u7 both the same,
is there something wrong?
If you think about it for a little bit,
you realize that this is a consequence
of the fact that if there is
a success run to occur at all,
there can be only up to one success
run in the first nine trials.
And, therefore, u6, u7, and so forth up
to u9 are going to have to be the same.
Now we can understand how
to build this forward.
From u7, you go to u8,
from u8 you go to u9.
Of course, doing it by hand is tedious and
not at all edifying but
this is the kind of task that
a digital computer excels at.
We simply write in one line of code,
which says compute this recursively.
And you do it, and
out comes a table like this.
I've given you the fractions
here explicitly, to.
Emphasize two things.
One, we're actually
computing this exactly,
not to some dissimilar approximation.
We can actually get the exact rational
value for each of these probabilities, but
of course a big fraction like
u20 is hardly defined, right?
So we'll, we'll eventually want
to look at it in decimal format
to get a better idea of what's going on.
And we shall.
The other thing to note is that in
the denominator, we have powers of two.
And that's going to arise
because we're dealing repeatedly
with a toss of a fair coin, and
we're going to have products of one half.
Okay.
Thus far, thus good, so good.
What we've discovered is a,
a systematic recursive process
by which we can compute all
the values un if we wish.
Now we've got this whole sequence
of values of u when what's next?
Well, the next step is to go on and
compute the first success
run probabilities.
That comes next.
