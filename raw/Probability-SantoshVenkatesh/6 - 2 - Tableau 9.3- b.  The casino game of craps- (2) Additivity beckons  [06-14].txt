So let's begin by conditioning on
the first step, on the first trial.
You recall W stands for
the event you win eventually at craps.
W sub n stands on the event
that you win on the nth trial.
And Fk stands for the event that you
throw a number k on the first trial.
The, the events F2,
F3 through F12 partition the space.
And while immediate appeal to
total probability, to additivity,
we can write down, we can decompose
the probability of winning.
By conditioning on
the probability of winning,
having thrown k on the first trial.
Very good, so far so good.
Now the question is,
is this decomposition helpful?
Indeed it is.
What have we given in this experiment?
Let's, let's pause and take a look.
We're told that we will throw a number k
with a probability Pk listed
on the left of your table.
So we know the numbers P2,
P3, P4 through P12.
What else do we know?
Well, we know certain
conditional probabilities.
We are given, that if we throw 7 or
11, you win immediately.
Therefore, the conditional property
of winning, having thrown a 7, is 1.
And the conditional probability of
winning, having thrown an 11 is also 1.
And we're told that we'll lose immediately
if you throw a 2 or a 3 or a 12.
The conditional probability of winning
is these cases is identically zero.
You can not possibly win,
in fact you've lost.
If you've thrown 2, 3 or
12 on the first trial.
Now we can fold this into
a total probability equation.
And the,
the terms corresponding to k equal to 2,
3 and 12 will vanish quietly
like the snows of yesteryear.
They contribute nothing to the sum.
Because the conditional probability in
those instances is additively zero.
The conditional probability in the cases
k equal to 7 to 11 contribute exactly 1.
And therefore,
our sum simplifies to P7 plus P11
plus now is sum over
the residual terms k running.
Between four, five, six,
eight, nine or ten.
Okay.
So that means now we now have
a conditional probability to evaluate in
those residual cases.
Let's move on directly and
see how we can go ahead and do this.
Now here is where our second
effort comes to mind.
So here is what we need to do.
We have to determine for the cases four,
five, six, eight, nine or ten.
What are the conditional probability
of winning having thrown
one of these numbers.
Recall that in such a setting,
the game progresses by
throwing the dice repeatedly.
Until you will win,
if the original number was thrown.
Now in such a case,
it is now natural to appeal
to additivity one more time and
break down the chance of winning.
By the chance of winning
on a designated trial.
If you win at all, you're going to win on
the first trial or the second trial or
the third trial and so forth.
In other words, the event W is
the union of the events W1, W2,
W3 and so on ad infinitum.
And still perhaps, we can drive
down the probability of W given Fk,
where k is one of four, five,
six, eight, nine or ten.
As the probability of
the union of events W sub n,
given that Fk has occurred, given
that k was thrown on the first trial.
What you've done is simply
appeal to additivity and
decomposed the event that you win into
the pieces that you win on given trials.
But the events Wn, W1, W2, W3 and so
forth, are clearly mutually exclusive.
They are disjoint.
If you win at all, you may,
might win on the third trial.
But in that case,
you haven't won on the fifth trial.
These are disjoint on
mutually exclusive events.
And additivity immediately
right to the rescue.
And so, the probability of union is
the sum of the conditional probabilities.
One more step is given to us
by the starting conditions.
Here and there,
we're interested in the special cases,
where we throw four, five, six, eight,
nine or ten on the first throw.
But if you threw four, five, six,
eight, nine or ten on the first throw,
then we know that the game proceeds.
It does not terminate.
You're going to have to
make at least one more row.
In other words, for these values for
k, the chance of winning on
the first throw is identically zero.
The probability of W1 given Fk,
for k, four, five,
six, eight, nine, or ten, is zero.
And therefore,
the first term in the sum disappears and
the sum simplifies ever so slightly.
It will sum for integer n,
ranging from the second trial
of the conditional
probabilities of Wn given Fk.
All right,
we've reduced the problem further.
So now the conditional probabilities
that we need to compute,
are obtained as a sum of
conditional probabilities.
And so
the final piece of the puzzle now is for
us to evaluate the conditional
probability of winning on the init trial.
When you have thrown k on the first trial.
And they're interested in particular for
the cases where k is four, five,
six, eight, nine or ten.
Where the trials will continue
after the first trial.
