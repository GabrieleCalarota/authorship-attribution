So let's summarize.
In discrete spaces,
what is important is the identification
of an honest mass function.
Let us test the understanding we've
built up by looking at simple examples.
So here is the first.
For what values of constant, say C,
is a particular putative mass function,
p of k, defined to be the constant,
which is yet unspecified,
times 2 to the power minus k defined
on the non-negative integers,
0, 1, 2, 3, and so forth, ad infinitum.
If one specifies a distribution of
this form, is there a value for
the constant C which would make
it a bona fide mass function.
An honest mass function.
Pause the lecture and see if you
can work your way through with it.
Now that you're back,
in settings like these,
positivity is usually simple to verify.
And in this case, since 2 to
the power minus k is always positive,
we know that if a constant is to work at
all, then the constant must be positive.
Okay.
So in such settings the question is
whether things can in fact be normalized.
And the issue here is
whether the sum of all
elements actually converges,
whether the series converges.
But in this case it's
a very simple series.
This is the geometrically
declining series.
It's an exponentially declining series.
And therefore we have
a geometric series formula.
The sum of reciprocal powers
of 2 is manifestly the re,
the reciprocal of 1 minus a half.
In other words, the entire sum
of 2 to the power of minus k,
k running from zero to infinity,
is exactly 2.
So if we sum up all of the pk's,
we'll get 2 times C.
Normalization mandates
that that has to be one.
And therefore C must be equal to one half.
Now once you're written this down
you say well this look familiar.
And indeed it is.
This, in fact, is exactly the geometric
distribution we saw in the last slide.
This is the geometric distribution with
a particular choice for the parameter.
The parameter here is one half.
Here is a second problem,
a slight variation on this theme.
This time I'm going to give you a
function, p of k, which is defined as some
constant times e to the power
minus the absolute value of k,
and k is allowed to run over all integers,
positive and negative.
For what value of C would this
be a bona fide distribution?
Would this be an honest mass function?
Again, pause the lecture
while you try to work it out.
Well, again, positivity is trite here.
The exponential function
is always positive and
therefore, if it is to work at all,
C must be a positive constant.
Positivity is usually trite.
And so, everything hinges upon
whether this series converges.
Suppose we add up all the elements e
to the power minus absolute value of k,
k running over all integers.
We find that at k equal to zero
we get a contribution of one.
And then you get a double contribution for
each value of k,
e to the power minus 1 for
k equal to 1 and minus 1,
e to the power minus 2 for
k equal to plus and minus 2 and so forth.
And so the series devolves
into another geometric series.
And if we sum this geometric series and
massage the algebra,
out come a very simple expression.
We get the sum of the series
is e plus 1 over e minus 1.
E, of course, is the Napier constant,
2.71828 and so forth.
And this is what the series converges to.
If you sum the values pk, they will get
e plus 1 over e minus 1 times C and
this must by normalization equal 1,
and therefore C is a reciprocal
of this ratio or in other words,
C is e minus 1 divided by e plus 1.
Yet one more.
Now I will take the function
I have just given you.
C times e to pi minus absolute value of
k and modulate it by multiplying it by
a value which is no more than one in
absolute value, cosine of pi times k.
Can this function,
defined as k varies over all integers,
be a distribution for
any choice of the constant C?
Again, pause the lecture and
see if you can verify this.
Now that you're back,
it would be tempting to test
normalization by writing down a series.
But we should pause for a moment, the easy
axiom to check normally is positivity and
we should always do a sanity check.
Are things positive?
And we immediately find
something troubling.
Cosine of pi times k when k is 0 is 1.
When k is 1 or minus 1, cosine is minus 1.
In fact, when k is an even number,
cosine of pi times k is plus 1.
And when k is an odd number,
cosine of pi times k is minus 1.
The cosine alternates in sign
between plus 1 and minus 1.
Which means that p of k,
however we choose C,
will be alternating in sign between
positive and negative values.
Positivity is immediately violated.
Whatever be the choice of C,
there would be some values k for
which these values p
of k will be negative.
And therefore this cannot
represent an atomic probability,
p of k cannot represent
an honest mass function.
