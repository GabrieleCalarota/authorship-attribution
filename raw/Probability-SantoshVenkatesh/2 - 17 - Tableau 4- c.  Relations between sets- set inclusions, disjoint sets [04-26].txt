Now where do we go from here?
Well, naturally enough,
we want to consider more than one subset.
So let's look at the possibilities when
we have more than one set at hand.
Bear in mind that there is an abstract
universal set chugging along in
the background providing elements
from which you're drawing subsets.
Now suppose we have
a second subset of omega.
So now let's say we have a set A, and
naturally enough, we call the next set B.
Well, what could the relationships
between A and B be?
Well, both A and
B represent subsets of this omega.
And I've shown you visually
a schema where it is clear
that every element in A in
the particular setting our man was aging
is contained in the collection
B that I'm showing you.
I have not told you exactly what omega is,
and what A is, and what B are.
But more toward the underlying
abstract relationship,
I'm saying that this kind of picture
connotes a membership, an inclusion.
Every member of A in the setting is in B.
Or A itself is a subset of B.
Now, two generic sets don't
necessarily have to have this
kind of inclusion relationship.
So, at the other end of the spectrum,
we could have a setting where A and
B are subsets of some omega, and
they share no elements whatsoever.
This turns into a very
important basic concept.
It's visually clear.
You have two collections,
and they do not overlap.
If that is the case,
we see that these subsets are disjoint.
And we create some more compact
mathematical notation to capture the idea
that two sets are disjoint.
We write A, and then a symbol denoting
a cup upside down, B.
This, in words we say, A intersection B.
And this is a small and quick preview of
the set operations intersections which
you will encounter on the next slide.
And we say that A cup B,
A intersection B, is empty.
We say the intersection of A and
B is empty.
In alternate language,
we say that A and B are disjoint.
And what be mean by all of this is that
A and B share no elements in common.
There is no omega which is in a and in b.
Of course,
these are not the only two possibilities.
More typically, we'll get something like
the picture in the middle of your screen.
Where you have two subsets of
an abstract set omega, and they overlap.
They are not mutually exclusive.
They're not disjoint.
Nor is one completely
contained in another.
Each of them has elements, little omega,
which the other does not have.
And, again, this is visually clear
in this kind of setting even though
I've not specified for
you what the sets are.
But they also contain some elements
from the original universal set,
which are common to both.
Okay.
And this kind of picture is more generic.
And it behooves us to look at it and say,
well, okay, if we have a setting like this
where we have two abstract subsets
of some abstract universal set.
And they have some kind of
relationship like this.
What can I do with them?
Well, naturally enough,
we can construct more subsets.
Richer subsets from these basic subsets.
And this is where the heart of the,
of the nomenclature,
the terminology is going to be.
So you should pay attention here.
And I'm going to articulate
three basic operations.
And these operations will inform
all of the set-theoretic
manipulations we will need.
From these we can build other
more complex operations.
