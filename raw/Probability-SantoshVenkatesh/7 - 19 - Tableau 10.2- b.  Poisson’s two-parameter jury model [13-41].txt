Poisson started investigating and
thinking about civil and
criminal trials, and
jury systems in France in the 1830s.
And he objected to the Laplacian
idea that a defendant
should be equally presumed to be guilty,
or innocent.
Poisson then introduced a two-parameter
model, the first of which
was a parameter capturing the guilt,
or innocence of the accused.
Suppose then,
that an accused individual is guilty
a proportioned theta of the time.
Theta is the probability that
the person in the dock is guilty.
In the technical language,
we can think of theta as regoverned
by a Bernoulli variable, Zed, which
takes value 1 with probability theta,
and 0 with probability 1 minus theta.
Zed then, is an indicator of guilt.
When it is 1, the person is guilty.
When it's 0, the person is innocent.
Poisson was acutely aware that theta
should not be considered fixed for
all time.
That in a tranquil society,
one might well anticipate that theta,
the probability of guilt,
is bigger than a half.
Presumably in a tranquil,
well-ordered society, prosecutors
don't just drag stray innocent people, and
throw them at the mercy of the courts.
In other words, there's a presumption
that due process was served,
that the prosecutors brought people
up before the court for good,
and sufficient reason on
the basis of validated suspicion.
But of course,
in turbulent times like the French
Revolution, this may not be the case.
And in cases like that,
you could have theta less than one-half
which signals a much more chaotic society,
where individuals are dragged
to the courts Willy-Nilly.
So, here is one parameter,
a parameter theta which at least at
the time at which the court decisions
are being made, should be considered
to be fixed at least temporarily.
It's a parameter of the problem.
Normally, it should help,
it is larger than one-half.
The second parameter was,
of course, the Laplacian parameter,
that juror decisions based on the evidence
presented to them are not always certain.
That juries can make mistakes.
Let p represent the probability
that a juror errs, makes an error.
Does not evaluate the data
in front of him properly.
Again, technically, we can think
of labelling, or tagging an error
through an error indicator,
a random variable X,
which represents a Bernoulli trial
with a success probability p.
X is 1 if an error was made,
0 if an error is not made.
In a well-ordered system,
and in well-selected juries,
one would hope that p
is less than one-half.
A juror is more likely to get
it right than to get it wrong.
Of course, the quantity p
could vary from jury to jury.
But as a matter of modeling,
in a sanitized world,
we could imagine that p is
essentially fixed for the veneer, or
the pool from which the jury is drawn.
A factor here is that the evaluatory
capability of the juror
is considered to be independent of
the guilt, or innocence of the accused.
So, you have two parameters specified
independently of each other.
Now, let us say,
where this kind of modeling will take us
in 19th century France.
In the years between 1825 to 1830,
juries in France
were comprised of 12 individuals,
and conviction required
a vote to convict from a strict majority
from at least seven of the jurors.
We now have a principle setting,
a sanitized bottle
in which we can query
the efficacy of jury verdicts.
So, to begin, what is the probability
space for jury verdicts?
I imagine it's, the years are between
1825 and 1830, we have a jury of size 12,
and a defendant who's accused.
The defendant is either guilty,
or not guilty.
This is a parameter Zed,
an indicator variable Zed,
which indicates guilt, or innocence.
All right.
The theta here is going to be capturing
the efficacy of the prosecutorial system,
how well law enforcement works in
a given country at a given time.
Now, bear in mind that the jury are not
a priori cognizant of the guilt or
the innocence.
So, the value of Zed the guilt or
the innocence, is known, to, let's say,
the an oracle who is establishing the,
the ground rules for this chance game.
The oracle says guilty or innocent.
And then, the jurors hear evidence.
And there are 12 jurors, and
each of them comes to a decision, either
correct or incorrect, naturally enough.
Let's tag whether the juror
made an error or not,
by a sequence of indicator variables X1,
X2, X3, through X12.
For each of the 12 jurors and
what do these variables indicate?
Well, Zed indicates whether
the person is guilty or innocent.
X1 through X12 indicate whether jurors
1 through 12 made an error or not.
What is the natural probability measure?
Clearly now we have a setting
where it is natural to posit
repeated independent trials.
Zed is of a lowly variable.
A guilt indicator with
a success probability theta.
Each of the Xs are Bernoulli variables,
error indicators with
success probability p.
Of course, we're viewing the success of
a coin toss, in a rather perverted and
twisted way.
Success for Zed means the person
is guilty, success for
the Xs means that the jurors
made mistakes, but no matter.
It's a coin toss.
And naturally model here is to posit
that these are all independent trials.
Now, it is not unreasonable,
perhaps, to posit the independence
of the Zed from the axis.
Guilt or innocence versus the ability
of a juror to logically and
coherently evaluate information
data presented to them.
The Xs, well, if one postulate
there are different people
with different mindsets and
independent faculties, then again,
we have a natural notion
that the Xs are independent.
The assumption here of course is that they
are sharing a common error probability p.
Now, if we start writing down
the probability measure for
the example,
now we've got a list of 13 ones and
zeros which represent guilt or innocence
followed by error or correct decisions.
From here, naturally a majority of vote
simply tabulates the votes of the jurors.
And so a natural question then is how many
errors are made by the jury as a whole?
Well, this is, of course,
simply a sum of X1 through X12.
Each X is a 1,
precisely when that juror makes a mistake.
And so, the sum of the Xs tells
you how many jurors are in error.
This, if you recall is what we call,
S subscript 12, a sum of 12 terms.
And because we're adding Bernoulli trials,
the result is going to be a binomial
distribution characterized by 12 tosses
of a coin whose success probability is p.
To summarize, the guilt indicator
Zed is a Bernoulli variable.
It takes value 1 with probability theta,
0 with probability 1 minus theta.
The Xs are independent juror
error indicators, we take
value 1 with probability p, hopefully less
than one-half, and take value 0, if they
make a right decision, with probability 1
minus p, hopefully bigger than one-half.
And the number of juror errors
conforms to a binomial distribution.
In annotation, the mass function
of the binomial is denoted b
with a subscript 12 for
the number of trials.
The success number, k,
the number of errors made, and
the success of the coin toss, p.
Okay, we now have a probability measure.
We know it's a product measure.
What are the relevant
events of interest here?
Naturally enough there are two
that you need to focus on.
The first, the fundamental question,
is the accused guilty or innocent?
Let G represent the event
that the defendant is guilty.
Let I, the compliment of G, naturally,
represent the event that
the accused is innocent.
There are two fundamental, linked events.
What else can you think about?
Well, naturally whether the interval
juror's convicted or not.
Let C denote the event that
the individual is convicted by the jury.
Recall for conviction, the jury needs
seven or more votes to convict.
And let A, the complement of C, denote
the event, that the accused is acquitted.
Now, remember, of course,
an event is a subset of the sample space.
The sample space is a list
of Bernoulli variables.
A guilt indicator and 12 error indicators.
What is the event G?
Well, G occurs precisely when
the indicator variable Zed is 1.
It is independent of
the choices the jurors make.
Therefore, all sequences which
begin with a 1 would be precisely
the event that we call G.
And of course, the event that we call I,
that the accuser is innocent
refers to all sequences in this chance
experiment which begin with a 0.
What about the event C that
an accuser is convicted?
Now, recall that in a jury process,
conviction is by a majority.
And you need an outright majority voting
to convict, to be able to convict a,
that individual.
Well, there are two cases here.
What if the individual
were actually guilty?
And of course the jurors don't
know this ahead of time.
Right?
They are going to make decisions based on
the evidence presented to them.
But suppose the evidence is presented
about an individual who was guilty.
In this case, a conviction will happen if
there are fewer than 5 errors in decision.
If a juror gets it right
then he will properly
have concluded that
the individual is guilty.
So as long as the number of jurors who
get it wrong who conclude that he is
innocent is 5 or fewer,
then he'll have a majority of 7 or
more jurors who agree that he is guilty
and the person will be convicted.
And therefore,
in the case when the individual,
the accused is guilty,
conviction occurs when the sum 12,
the number of jury errors
is no more than 5.
What about if the innoce,
the individual are innocent?
Now, in this case, conviction will occur
if 7 or more jurors get it wrong.
If the individual is innocent,
and if seven or
more jurors conclude that he is guilty,
then, in fact, he will be convicted.
And therefore, in the case when
the individual at hand is innocent,
conviction occurs when the sum
of juror errors is 7 or more.
Of course now we can readily transcribe
this into what kind of sample points fit
these criteria?
At this point now we're equipped to
begin an analysis of the problem.
And we shall turn to this next.
