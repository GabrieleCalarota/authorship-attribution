So now we know how drug testing
in principal is conducted.
And of course, it works.
Else, we would hardly do it.
Right?
So let's probe into why it actually works
and what kinds of guaranties we get.
So, the setting is as follows.
Remember that we have
a double blind sample.
One group of patients is given the drug,
one group is given a sugar pill or
a placebo.
We track the incidence of
problems reported by each group,
we get the Bernoulli trials.
Out of this, we construct a discrepancy in
the relative frequency of problems
in one group vis-a-vis the relative
frequency of problems in the other group,
we have a discrepancy delta.
Bear in mind that once we've collected
the data, we know this number delta.
It's chance-driven.
Each time we do the experiment,
we're going to get a different number.
But for our experiment, we know delta.
Our question is the following.
Is this observed discrepancy
larger than we would expect
from just natural random variation if
the drug were actually really safe?
And now we have a principled basis for
a statistical test.
We've seen something like this when we
discussed the hot hand in basketball.
So, without further ado, what is the idea?
We assess the likelihood of
the observed the discrepancy delta,
the known delta,
assuming the drug were truly harmless.
If the drug were truly harmless,
would we get such a delta
by just chance fluctuation?
And we do this by comparison
with a port experiment.
Or in the German, a gedanken experiment,
where we consider what would
happen if we had a double blind,
double sample of patients,
both of whom are given a placebo.
In other words, if the drug were harmless,
then as far as health complications
are concerned,
it behaves just like a sugar pill.
It's as if we gave both groups
of patients sugar pills.
Why don't we assess what would
happen in this thought experiment
if we gave two groups of patients sugar
pills and ask what are the chances that
the discrepancy there is larger than
the observed discrepancy delta?
All right.
And
this will then lead us to a principled
idea of how it's going to work.
So, let's start.
The gedkanken experiment, the thought
experiment, consists of generating,
in principle, a double sample of patients
split double blind into two groups,
and each group is given placebos.
The first group reports
health complications,
according to a sequence
of Bernoulli trials.
Let's call them X1 through Xn.
The second group, in principle, reports
health problems according to Bernoulli
trials, X1 prime through Xn prime.
Since both groups are given, being
given these sugar pills, they're both
governed by the same Bernoulli parameter,
p, which we do not know, right?
This is the probability of occurrence,
of health complications,
in the patient pool if you are given
anything, if they're given a sugar pill.
From here, we directly figure out how many
patients were affected in the first group.
Call it S sub n, the number of
complications in that group, and
the number of complications in the second
group, we call it S sub n prime.
And we, of course,
know that by adding Bernoulli trials,
we're going to get binomial distribu,
distribution variables.
So, both Sn and
Sn prime are binomially distributed
with parameters n, the number of trials.
And p, the success probability.
Bear in mind that we do not know p.
But we do know n.
N is a number in the sample.
But p is the unknown rate at
which complications occur
in the general population if
they are not given treatment.
Okay?
What is the key idea?
Ask, how likely is it that the difference
in the relative frequencies
in the first group given a placebo,
and the second group given a placebo,
are in excess of the observed discrepancy
of the test done in practice?
So let's put some mathematical window
dressing around, let's dress it up, so
that we can focus clearly on what
it is that we want to calculate.
We want to evaluate the probability
that the difference
on the relative frequencies of
incidents in the two placebo groups in
absolute value exceeds the observed
discrepancy delta in the experiment that
was actually done in our clinical trial.
So this is what we want to evaluate.
We should immediately pause, take stock,
and get our minds around what
the chance experiment really is.
What is a sample space?
Well, naturally enough, the sample space
is a two n-tuple of ones and zeroes.
Two n Bernoulli trials.
Okay?
What is the probability measure?
Oh, it's going to be engendered
by just multiplying ps and qs,
because of independent trials.
And what is the event at hand?
Well it is informed by Sn and
Sn prime, and
let's focus on exactly what that
means by simplifying our fractions.
Clear the denominator by
multiplying all the terms by n.
And we find that this is equivalent to
the statement that we want to evaluate
the probability.
That the number of occurrences
in the first placebo group,
differs from the number of occurrences
in the second placebo group
in absolute value, by n times delta,
the observed discrepancy or more.
Okay.
Now we've got this concrete object to wrap
our heads around.
Let's put this down,
examine it and say, well okay,
here's what we've got,
how do we go about computing it?
The event at hand is determined by
the difference between the accumu,
accumulated sum Sn and Sn prime.
So let's focus on this.
Now both Sn and
Sn prime are chance-driven, but
we know that they are binomially
distributed variables.
Of course, we know the n, and
we know there's an hidden but
fixed p underlying all of this.
So they're binomially distributed with
parameters n and p, and of course we know
that the expected value of these binomial
distributions is exactly n times p.
And so, a happy thought strikes us.
Sn and Sn prime are chance-driven,
but we know that we expect
each of them to concentrate around
the center, around n times p.
Why don't we simply compare
each of them to n times p?
Well, say, look at Sn minus Sn prime.
And by the simple expedient of adding and
subtracting n times p.
And grouping terms, we now have two terms.
On the right, each term in
the round brackets is a comparison
of a binomial with its expected value.
And we know a great deal about these,
don't we?
'Kay.
Let's simplify things just
a little bit further.
On the right, we have two terms.
In round brackets, a term,
let's call it a for simplicity.
And in round brackets a term,
let's call it b.
And so
we have the absolute value of a minus b.
But elementary algebra tells
us that the absolute value of
a minus b is no larger than the absolute
value of a plus the absolute value of b.
This is what we call
the triangle inequality.
If we want to appeal to geometry,
this is just a statement that two sides
of a triangle are larger than the third.
Okay, with this identification of a and
b, we can see immediately that
the desired observed value for
difference is bounded about
by a sum of two differences,
Sn minus np, and Sn prime minus np.
Of course now we want the probability
the object on the left exceeds epsilon.
But this engine,
there's a new principle, right?
On the left,
we want Sn minus Sn prime in absolute
value to exceed a certain quantity.
This is the event at hand.
Let's use a's and b's to simplify
notation for the time being.
We want the absolute value of a minus b to
be larger than the absolute value of c for
some positive c.
Good.
But if a minus b in absolute value
should exceed the absolute value of c,
then it prefers forces at least one
of two inequalities to be true,
that either a in absolute value has to be
bigger than c in absolute value over two.
Or, b in absolute value has to exceed c in
absolute value over 2, or perhaps both.
Why?
If both the conditions on
the right were violated,
if a was smaller than c over 2 and
b was smaller than c over 2,
then the difference of a and b in absolute
value, could not possibly exceed c.
And so, the condition on the left
implies the occurrence of at least one
of the two conditions on the right.
Right?
Let's write it out now in words,
identifying our a and our b, and our c.
If the event that Sn minus Sn
prime in absolute value exceeds
n delta is to occur,
then at least one of the two events,
Sn minus np in absolute value
exceeds n delta over 2, or
Sn prime minus np in absolute
value exceeds n delta over 2.
At least one of those
two events has to occur.
The occurrence of the event on
the left implies the occurrence of at
least one of the two events on the right.
Or, yet again,
if you want to describe it mathematically,
the event on the left is a set, and
that set is contained in the union
of the two events on the right.
Now we've come to a right
understanding of the event at hand.
All's, almost, however, bother shouting.
Let's assemble everything together.
