Now that we have come to an understanding
of identities involving binomial
coefficients, it's time to
examine them a little more
closely to see if there's some more
structure in them that we can extract.
And the way we'll do it, and
the most natural way to do this,
is to look at the binomial coefficients
starting from simple cases.
In this we echo the aphorism,
the prescription of the Hungarian
mathematician George Polya, who encourages
us to look at the simplest version
of problems that we don't understand,
and try to grapple with them first.
On the premise, of course, that by
understanding simple versions of problems,
more deeper, more complex structures
will start becoming apparent,
as we discover patterns.
So accordingly, let's start writing
binomial coefficients down starting at
small values of n and
small values of k, and build up.
Now, if we do this, we can very quickly
engender a triangle of coefficients.
This is actually called a Pascal's
pyramid, or Pascal's triangle,
after the mathematical physicist and
philosopher Blaise Pascal,
who examined these coefficients oh,
around the middle of the 17th century.
So, imagine now we have got
a pyramid balanced on its apex, and
the way we are going to think
about this is as follows, n,
the size of the population, is going
to increase upwards, k is going to
run from left to right, between
the values 0, 1, through up till n.
So let's start at the bottom.
If n is 0, k has got only one possible
value, so we have 0 choose 0.
If n is 1, the first non-trivial case,
then k can be either 0 or 1.
We arrange them, as 1 choose 0,
and 1 choose 1 above 0 choose 0.
Then we go to n equal to 2.
And when n is 2, can take, k can take
one of three values, 0, 1, or 2.
We have three possibilities for
the binomial coefficients.
We write them down in a row.
And then, n equal to 3, n equal to 4,
and we form this triangle.
Now, the moment you write
something like this down,
well it's graceful, you can see
a nice little triangle emerging.
That's pretty.
But it doesn't really sing to us, does it?
To get a little bit more,
we should toss in some numerical values.
So let's evaluate these
binomial coefficients.
I'll leave you to verify that the numbers
I'm going to show you were in fact,
accurate, that we've been honest about it.
But spend a little time,
it'll be good exercise, and
come up with at least some of the numbers
at the lower part of the triangle.
When you are ready, proceed, and
when you do, here is what we discover.
The numbers in red, which appear
atop the binomial coefficients,
are what they numerically evaluate to.
Now, the binomial coefficients have given
us a pyramid, or a triangle of numbers.
Well, we should look at them.
Do we discern any patterns?
Does anything leap out at us?
Pause the lecture while
you look at your pyramid.
Stare at it, look at it upside down,
swivel around, have a drink,
come back, and look at it again.
And see if you can discern any
kind of pattern in this structure.
Well, now that you're back,
let's take a look at, for
example, the binomial coefficient 5 choose
2 around the middle of your pyramid.
And the moment you look at that,
you discern, and use your little feature.
5 choose 2 is 10.
10 is equal to 4 plus 6.
But those are exactly the values
of the binomial coefficients,
beneath 5 choose 2,
at the base of a triangle.
4 choose 1 plus 4 choose 2,
is exactly 5 choose 2.
There's a triangle of opportunity here.
And the moment you
see something like this you realize
there are triangles everywhere.
And here are examples of triangles.
Oh, this is lovely.
We're actually seeing patterns
evolve in front of our eyes.
These triangles appear to be pervasive,
in fact, every binomial coefficient
appears to be equal to the sum of the two
binomial coefficients at its base.
We are on our way to
discovering a general formula.
N choose k is n minus 1 choose k
plus n minus 1 choose k minus 1.
Okay, now of course, we discovered this
formula by examining special cases.
But we shouldn't rest on our
laurels quite so easily.
These were special cases for
the rows I've shown you.
How do we know that this
formula is true in general?
For this we're going to have
to do a little bit of a work.
But it is a truism in mathematics, but
valuable nonetheless,
that it is always advisable in
a mathematical endeavor to start with the
answer whenever it is humanly possible.
In this case, we've discovered a putative
answer; now we can go about verifying it.
And let's do this.
And our procedure is going
to be very straightforward.
We're going to simply write down
the algebraic definition of these binomial
coefficients, and then massage the
algebra, and see if we get an identity.
Let's go forward.
So to verify Pascal, Pascal's triangle,
we're going to start
with the right-hand side.
N minus 1 choose k minus 1, and
n minus 1 choose k, write them down.
As always take your time,
write down the expressions.
Pause the lecture while
you're writing it down.
And restart when you're ready.
Now, once you write down these definitions
of these binomial coefficients,
what have we got?
Well, we've got falling
factorials divided by factorials.
The terms, the fractions,
clearly overlap, and so
we ought to take out terms that
are common in this, in those two.
So here's the next step.
Make the denominator of the first
fraction, k factorial by multiplying by k.
And extract the last term,
the following factorial,
in n minus 1 to the k fall,
falling for the second fraction.
And now we've got a new expression.
Again, you write it down, ponder it,
make sure that it is honestly,
algebraic and proper.
Now, when you come back,
we've got two expressions.
And now,
the common factors are manifest and clear.
Let's pull out the term,
n minus 1 to the k minus 1,
falling, divided by k factorial
from both terms of the expression.
And when you do that,
we are left with elementary algebra.
Consolidate terms in the square brackets.
Verify that what you get is exactly,
n minus 1 to the k minus 1
falling over k factorial times n.
In other words,
you've started at n minus 1,
you've got k minus 1 terms going forward,
each one less than the other.
And now, you're going to
append a term n to the left.
And that gives you exactly,
n to the k falling over k factorial.
But of course,
that is exactly the definition of
a binomial coefficient, n choose k.
We have verified Pascal's triangle
by purely algebraic methods.
Now, as I've told you earlier,
in combinatorial settings like this,
it is frequently possible
to directly intuit
a logical combinatorial
argument issuing all algebra.
Can you see a combinatorial argument,
which can directly get you to
the identity, without doing any algebra?
Here's a clue.
Suppose you consider a population
of n minus 1 individuals.
And now, suppose you add one more
individual to the population,
that's the nth individual.
From the population as a whole,
suppose we are going to draw a subsample,
a subpopulation of k members.
Now, you know, of course,
there are n choose k ways of doing this.
Now, of the key individuals you pick,
each such subpopulation
is in one of two types,
either the last individual is
included among your collection
of k individuals, or he is not.
If he is not included,
then from the original population of n
minus 1 individuals, you must select k.
There are n minus 1 choose
k ways of doing this.
If he is included, then from the original
population of n minus 1 indi,
individuals you must specify k minus 1.
And there are n minus 1 choose
k minus 1 ways of doing this.
And we've directly verified Pascal's
triangle by a purely combinatorial
logical argument without the necessity for
any algebra whatsoever.
But of course, it is always comforting
to have a firm algebraic verification to
be able to put in our back pockets,
so we know we are on solid ground.
We know we have not overcounted.
We know we have not undercounted.
Now, the way to view Pascal's
triangle is to think of this
as a defining characteristic
of the binomial coefficients.
You will find as you go forward that
this identity is enormously useful
in simplifying calculations
involving these coefficients.
