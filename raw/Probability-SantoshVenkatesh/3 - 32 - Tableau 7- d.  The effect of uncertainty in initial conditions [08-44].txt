Now this is now a beautiful
deterministic picture.
A coin toss then is going to give you
something which is completely predictable.
Where is there any room for randomness?
Why do we imagine that a coin toss
gives us heads half the time and
tails half the time?
If for example we have a high velocity and
a very small angular velocity,
then we will be in the red region, beneath
the first of your hyperbolic curves.
And therefore the coin
will give you a head.
Well, because if you have a very high
velocity but the coin is barely spinning,
well it'll come back,
it will not have spun very much.
And therefore you'll get a head.
If likewise you toss the coin very
slowly so it doesn't go very far but
you toss it with a high angular velocity.
Well the coin will not have much time
to spin before it's caught again.
And therefore you will still get a head.
If you increase speed and
velocity in concert
in such a way that you land in
the next band, you'll get a tail.
This seems like there's no room here for
anything but determinism.
Well let's pause and consider, in a real
experiment, where are we in this figure.
Remember, your x-axis
here is your velocity v.
Your y-axis here represents
the angular velocity omega.
Now, measurements of actual coin tosses,
when people toss coins like this,
will show that the velocity
imparted is somewhere
typically between 7 to 9 feet per second.
Now in terms of scientific units,
in terms of metric units,
that's about 2 to 3 meters per second.
And so in your figure,
this corresponds to that narrow band of
velocities from 2 to 3 meters per second.
What about your angular velocity?
One can imagine how to measure velocity,
right?
For instance we can just toss the coin,
catch it, and
we can figure out what
the velocity should have been.
The angular velocity appears to
be a trickier thing to measure.
Of course one imagine, you know, if one
has access to sophisticated equipment,
one could use a laser beam, bounce it off
the coin and measure various parameters.
But one doesn't have to get nearly so
sophisticated.
Persi Diaconis came up with a very clever,
ingenious idea for measuring
velocity of angular velocity using
dental floss, and watching it unravel.
And via such experiments,
he concluded that a typical coin toss
has an angular velocity of around
36 to 39 revolutions per second.
If you translate that into radians,
that corresponds
to somewhere around 225 to
250 radians per second.
And you realize that our
picture is woefully inadequate,
because on the one hand, we have speeds
much larger than are actually realized.
On the other,
in terms of the angular velocities,
we are nowhere near where we need to be.
And I'll show you angular velocities
up to about 14 radians per second and
what we really need is something
like 225 to 250 radians per second.
So, let's go ahead and redraw this picture
by foreshortening the velocity axis
to the regional velocities of interest,
say up to about 5 meters per second.
And stretching out the angular
velocity axis to the region
again of interest of around 250
to 300 radians per second and
if we did that we'd get a slightly
more congested family of curves,
all hyperbolic of course,
which look like this.
Now notice, velocities are running
up to 5 meters per second.
Angular velocities up to
300 radius per second.
And the region of interest to us, the
region where typical coin tosses reside,
are velocities between 2 and
3 meters per second.
And angular velocities between 225 and
250 radians per second as shown in
that narrow band in your
figure on the right.
So naturally enough, we should look at
that small region and expand it, and
look at it carefully to see what
stories it can unfold for us.
So let's take a look at
that little shaded region.
Velocities, but in 2 to 3 meters per
second, angular velocities between 225 and
250 radius per second, and
now you notice the hyperbolic
segments which are captured in this
little window appear almost vertical.
They appear to striate this
window in narrow bands.
The shaded regions represent combinations
of velocity and angular velocity for
which the outcome will be a head.
And the unshaded regions correspond
to combinations of velocity and
angular velocity for
which the outcome will be a tail.
And this is what the picture looks like.
Now you will tell me justly well Akin
there doesn't appear to be any room for
randomness.
You tell me what the speed and
the angle of velocity is and
I know exactly what happens.
So for example,
if here is a combination of v and
omega, it lands you slap bang in
the middle of a shaded region,.
You say,
well the outcome is going to be a head.
But here is the rub,
it is very hard in practice to
obtain exactly the same speed and
the same angular rotation each
time when tossing the coin.
There is naturally some variability,
some uncertainty in these parameters.
And so a natural question is how does
an uncertainty in the initial velocity and
in the initial angular velocity
affect the outcome of the toss?
So [INAUDIBLE] the particular velocity and
angular velocity.
In your picture, it's about, slightly
around 2.2 meters per second in terms of
velocity and maybe about, oh, around 237
radians per second in angular velocity.
Now, suppose there's some uncertainly
in the angle of velocity,
the rate at which the coin is turning?
Now, see what happens.
So if there's uncertainty
there then you're up and
down in a certain region,
but you never leave a band.
The bands are almost vertical here.
And so vertical uncertainties
don't seem to matter very much.
What if there is uncertainty
translationally in your velocity?
Oh, but now the bands are very narrow.
And so even a small uncertainty
leaves a shaded band and
goes into an unshaded band,
then perhaps goes back into a shaded band.
Small uncertainties result in dramatic
changes in the outcome of the coin toss.
Now let's summarize.
So, the outcome of the coin toss is, for
the kinds of velocities and angular
velocities encountered at practice,
relatively insensitive to small
changes in angular velocity.
But it is very sensitive to small
changes in the translational velocity.
The shaded region and the unshaded
region are almost equal in area.
Any reasonable model of
uncertainty will then tell you
that you're as likely to end up in
a shaded region as in an unshaded region.
You conclude inevitably that
the coin toss outcome is heads and
tails with equal chance.
Remarkably chance arises and
it is relatively
insensitive to the particular model
of uncertainty for your velocity.
A purely deterministic physical experiment
governed by Newtonian laws of mechanics
can be ascribed a chance driven outcome.
Because small uncertainties,
regardless of the origin,
manifest themselves into this fair
chance that is observed at the end.
