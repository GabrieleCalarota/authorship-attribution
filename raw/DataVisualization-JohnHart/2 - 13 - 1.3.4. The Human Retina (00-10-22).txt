[NOISE] So
when we communicate information to
a human observer through
data visualization,
the first step of that process is for
the human to perceive
the data through the retina.
And so we'll discuss the retina.
We're going to learn about the eye and
how does the eye sense light.
And based on that knowledge of how
the eye physically senses the light,
we can figure out how small the details
of a visualization can be, and
what colors should you
use in a visualization.
So we're going to focus on the eye and
the mechanics of the eye.
And this is a image of the eye,
an illustration from Gray's Anatomy.
And the eye consists of
a lens that focuses the light
that it receives from an aperture
that is controlled by this iris,
and it focuses that
light onto this retina.
And this retina contains the sensors
that basically determine what light is
hitting what part of this image plane.
So we don't have an image plane.
It's more of a hemisphere.
And the important part here
is this fovea centralis.
This is your center of vision.
When you look at something, it's because
that something you're looking at is
getting focused onto the fovea centralis.
This is where you have a lot of sensors
that can tell a lot of detail about what
you're looking at, then less sensors
as you get farther away from that.
You also have an optic nerve
that connects to your retina.
And you don't have any sensors here to be
able to see the light that's coming in,
so there's a blind spot that we have.
And we don't even realize we have the
blind spot because our perceptual system
is covering it up in a way that we
don't even realize is happening.
So this leads to the notion
of visual acuity.
How sharp is your vision?
What can you see?
How small of a detail can
you present to a viewer?
And we measure our visual acuity
when we go to an eye doctor and
we look at one of these eye charts.
And it tells us our Snellen ratio, 20/X,
which means you can distinguish at
20 feet what the average person
can distinguish at X feet.
So if you can only see this letter E,
then you have 20/200 vision,
meaning you can see this E at 20 feet
when the average person can see this E
even as far away as 200 feet.
And if you can see below this red
line you have better than 20/20,
better than average vision.
And the reason you can distinguish
these letters is that their
features project to a certain
distance apart on the retina.
And if your lens is doing a good
job of focusing that information,
then the sensors on your retina
can resolve those details.
If your lens is not doing such a good job,
then the image that's getting presented
isn't going to be as resolved
as well by your sensors.
And so your retina basically is
going to consist of rods and cones.
Rods perceive the brightness and
cones perceive color.
There's three varieties of cones,
[COUGH] cones that perceive
mostly red colors,
cones that perceive mostly green colors,
and
cones that perceive mostly blue colors.
And then there is a variety of additional
processing that happens by the ganglions,
these other nerve cells after the retina.
But these rod and cones are useful
to look at for the moment.
You have 80 million rods and
only 5 million cones, so
your intensity vision is much
better than your color vision.
Your rods are denser away from the fovea.
Your fovea, your center of vision,
is mostly cones, as it turns out.
So astronomers have learned when they're
looking at very dim stars to look slightly
away from the star, look slightly off to
the side of what they're studying, so
that their rods can process
the information and
not their cones because their rods are
more sensitive to the changes in light.
And they're quite sensitive.
They don't even turn
on when it's daylight.
And then you have cones.
And they're, again,
sensitive to various wavelengths of light.
They're very dense in the fovea,
anywhere from 100,000 to 325,000 cones
per millimeter squared in the fovea.
And they can distinguish about 150 hues.
And combined between the different hues,
you know a hue is a color in the rainbow,
and the different shades and
intensities and saturations,
you end up with about 7 million
different shades that you can
distinguish with your eye.
Depending on your lens, all lenses exhibit
some form of a chromatic aberration,
and that means that refraction
depends on the wavelength of light.
And so light at the red
wavelengths is going to focus
at a different location than light in the
green wavelengths or the blue wavelengths.
And this creates a dispersion that
can create problems with focus.
And this is why Blue Blocker sunglasses or
amber sunglasses,
which are nothing more than just
amber-shaded filters on your sunglasses,
they're going to aid your vision because
they're filtering out blue light.
And blue tends to focus off the retina,
whereas red and
green tend to focus closer to the retina.
So the blue wavelengths are actually
blurring the image and the red and
green wavelengths are generally
sharper on the retina.
It'd be good to avoid pure blue text, or
at least desaturate it with a little
bit of red or green colors,
to aid in focusing on edges of texts or
important figures.
There's some interesting
properties of color.
This isn't necessarily chromatic
aberration, but we tend to perceive
the red as being closer than the blue, and
this is part of our perceptual system.
For color perception there's
a difference in brightness as well.
Blue is generally a darker
color than red or green.
If you look at the pure
luminance of a color,
the luminance of that color will be
30% of its red component plus 59% of
its green component plus
10% of its blue component.
That means that green is six
times as bright as blue, and
green is twice as bright as red, and
red is three times as bright as blue.
And if you have yellow,
you can create yellow in the additive
color system by red plus green.
Yellow is very bright.
It's 31% plus 59% gives
you 90% brightness.
And you can figure out the luminance
of these other colors based on that.
Also it's important to acknowledge
that a good number of people,
in particular 10% of males,
are colorblind.
And if you're displaying
information with color,
you may want to add additional
cues to that information so
that people that are colorblind
can also understand it.
And also to pay attention to contrast,
because if
you're displaying something only with
color, then people who are colorblind
aren't going to be able to tell
the difference just on color contrast.
And so you may want to change
the brightness of the color as well, and
use this formula to make
sure neighboring colors
have different brightnesses in
addition to different hues.
These red, green and blue colors get
changed into a different color space,
basically a brightness shade and
then a brightness
minus blue and a red minus green channel.
So you get a color space that goes from
black to white, yellow to blue, and
red to green.
This is the black-white channel.
This is the yellow-blue channel.
And this is the red-green channel.
That's what actually gets sent to
the brain after some processing
of the retinal image.
And so your cones and
rods will start to get exhausted.
[COUGH] If you stare at the + in
the middle of the screen here,
you'll start to see that
the purple dot that's missing,
instead of missing will
start to turn green,
because it's turning into
the complement of the purple color.
And if you keep staring at the +,
eventually that green
dot will eat up the rest of the dots and
you're left with a solid gray screen.
And this is all due to basically
some exhaustion of the rods and
cones in your perceptual system.
So what did we learn?
We learned that the retina senses
brightness with rods and color with cones.
And that we have more cones in
the center of our vision but
more rods in our peripheral vision.
And we tend to focus better on warmer
colors because of chromatic aberrations.
We also tend bring them to the forefront.
It's good to keep these things in mind
when you're deciding how big to make
text and what color to choose for various
properties in your data visualization.
