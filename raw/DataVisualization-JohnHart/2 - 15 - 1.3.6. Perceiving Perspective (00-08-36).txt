When we present
visual data to an observer, sometimes
the perceptual processing that we use
to perceive our three-dimensional world
gets in the way of perceiving visual data.
So we'll learn how we perceive a 3-D
world from the two-dimensional image on
our retina, and how that ability to
perceive a 3-D world can interfere with
the visual presentation
of two-dimensional data.
And what we can do to
avoid that misperception.
So again, we'll look at the visual
part of the model human processor.
Basically, our eye is going to be
sensing data that is going to be
processed by this perceptual processor.
And this perceptual processor
has been developed to
understand three dimensional scenes
more than two dimensional scenes.
In particular, perspective,
perspective is a broad word.
It includes things like foreshortening;
the fact that three dimensional objects
are projected onto an image plane or
onto our retinal hemisphere.
And that projection
creates foreshortening.
So if I look at a unit cube,
when I look a projection of
a unit cube on an image plane.
Some of the edges
are shorter than the others.
The edges in the depth direction
are going to be shorter than
the edges in the transverse directions.
And so that's Foreshortening.
The fact that this edge is shorter
than this edge in the projection.
Even though in the three dimensional
scene they're the same length.
And so lengths in a projection
are not necessarily accurate compared
to the lengths in the real world.
But perceptually we've grown to understand
that these lengths could
be the same length.
And the differences are the result of
the projection onto the image plane.
And then there's linear perspective,
and you can see that here.
Here we have a projector which is
basically aligned from the object to
a focal point through an image plane here
that's being used by this early artist
in order to get to create
a perspective drawing of this object,
when we were first understanding
how perspective worked.
Basically, Linear Perspective says that
objects that are farther away appear
smaller.
And you can see that here.
And then we have Size Constancy.
We know that objects like this musical
instrument, aren't going to change size.
And so
if an object appears to be changing size,
it must be moving farther away from us or
closer to us.
And that objects that appears smaller
than other objects must be farther away.
That set a size constancy
expectation we have, and
our perceptual system depends on that.
So it can also malfunction.
And so,
here I've got a very simple line drawing.
With two parallel lines A and B, and
then I've got two lines that
are receding in the distance.
They're kind of sloped against each other.
And these two lines can set
up the appearance of, for
example, railroad tracks or
some two lines that are converging to a
vanishing point in a perspective drawing.
And if that's the case, then line A,
if this was a perspective
rendering of a scene, line A should
be farther away from us than line B.
And if that's the case,
line A should be much bigger.
And in fact line A looks bigger
in this image because of that.
But actually line A and
line B are the same size.
But when we add these additional lines
in here, when we add a perspective
context to these lines, line A looks
bigger because it's further away.
Similarly I can have two equal
length vertical lines here.
And if I add a few other decorations,
suddenly I've changed the length.
And now this line looks shorter, and
this line looks taller, even though
I know that they're the same length.
After adding these additional lines
I've increased, I've decreased
the size of this line and increased
the size of this line perceptually.
And the reason is, if I follow these
out further, I'm thinking of this line,
In perspective as being
the front corner of a cube
and this line as being the back corner,
for example, a room.
If this is the floor and
the ceiling and these are two walls.
This is the back corner of a room.
And this is the closest
corner of an external cube.
If that's the case then I would
expect this line to be farther away,
because it's the back corner.
And this line to be closer to me
because it's the front corner.
And in perspective if I have two line but
this line is closer to me and
this line is further away, even though
these two lines are the same length this
one looks bigger because
it's farther away.
Perspective can also confuse us
just from foreshortening not
from linear perspective.
So here I've got an parallelogram and
anytime you have parallel lines that
aren't meeting at 90 degree angles.
We expect them to be
receding into the distance.
And, so, here,
even though this is just a parallelogram,
you want it to be a quadrilateral
with right angles.
A rectangle that just happens to
be receding into the distance and
that it's being foreshortened into a
parallelogram because it's being projected
onto our retina.
If that was the case, then if this
is receding into the distance,
then the fact that B is closer to
this point than it is to this point
would make this line
a shorter than line C.
And just looking at the figure,
it looks like line AB is shorter than
line BC, when in fact line AB and
BC are the same length,
because this is an isosceles triangle.
Now this also works with texture.
Here I just have
an arrangement of ellipsoids.
A two-dimensional
arrangement of ellipsoids.
We tend to perceive it as, for example,
the tops of oil barrels
receding off into the distance,
because I've got smaller features,
and more features, in the distance.
And so I've got a higher
frequency of smaller features.
In the distance and a lower frequency of
fewer, larger, features in the foreground,
and we tend to attribute that to a
projection of linear perspective as well.
And we also have certain
lighting assumptions.
We're used to the sun being overhead,
and so we're used to objects,
seeing the front sides of objects, and
those objects are illuminated from above.
And so we see this dot illuminated
from above as a convex sphere.
And we see this dot illuminated
from below with the illumination
on the bottom side as being a concave
indentation because we don't expect
illumination to come from the bottom.
We expect illumination to come
from the top, and the only way for
this to be illuminated from the top
like this is if it was an indentation
instead of a bowl just as
it is on the left side.
And so, what are we learning?
We're learning that
perception of an object.
For example of the size
of the object is based on
our perception of the distance
of the object from us.
And if there are cues in an ordinary
flat image that might trigger
our perceptual- our perception of
distance based on perspective,
then that can confuse our
perception of size as well.
We're going to want to compare sizes and
positions of objects when we're
presenting data visually.
And we have to ensure that we're not
confusing that perception of size and
position based on the misperception of
depth due to these extraneous cues.
