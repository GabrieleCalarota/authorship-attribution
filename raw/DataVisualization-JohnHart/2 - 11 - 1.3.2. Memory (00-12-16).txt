So
as we discuss the human we'll discuss
human memory and ways of, that can help
take data visualizations and help people
remember them and learn from them.
So, we're going to learn, what's
the difference between, for example,
short term memory and
long term memory and sensory memory.
And how can we get things between
short term and long term memory?
How can we remember things better?
And essentially, how can we learn better?
So we'll start again with
this model human processor.
Except where we organize.
And I want to focus on the memory of this.
And that's the visual image store, the
auditory image store, the working memory,
the long term memory.
And these are connected by the perceptual
processors in the cognitive processes.
And so I can reorganize this.
We have the sensory image stores
that go to the perceptual processor,
which places information in the working
memory, which then goes to the cognitive
processor, and places information
in the long-term memory.
And this process of taking
information from your senses and
putting it into working
memory is based on attention.
When you're paying attention to something,
like for example,
the fact that I'm pointing the pointer and
talking to you right now,
you're taking the elements in your very,
very short term
sensory stores and you're processing them
and putting them in your working memory.
Now, because this is classroom
material you want to remember that.
And so you need to take these details
that I'm describing to you, and
take them from working memory and
put them in long-term memory.
And that's a process that's
usually called rehearsal.
There's a number of ways to do that but
it's effectively called rehearsal.
And you'll notice working memory
only holds about 7 items.
And those items are available for
about seven seconds.
You can hold one item much longer, but
for several items it's about
seven seconds before they decay.
And I've got several things on the screen.
So you're processing each of these.
Like, you know, the perceptual store
attention, and perceptual processor.
And trying to rehearse those and
put those in long term memory before
you try to memorize these other things.
So, sensory memory is really
short term device memory.
You know, on a cell phone, it would be the
CCD array that's recording the image data.
And it'd be the registers
that are used to store and
organize that information before
being sent as an image to the CPU.
Visually, we have iconic memory.
This is persistence of vision.
You look at something
flashed on the screen and
you can remember it even
though it's not there anymore.
That's your iconic memory,
your visual sensory memory.
And this only lasts about half a second.
You have echoic memory for hearing
things that last for about a minute and
a half, or sorry, one and a half seconds.
And then you have haptic memory which
you can remember touch as well.
And then these constants can go up or
down, based on arousal.
How much attention are you paying?
Arousal means that you're
paying more attention.
And that can increase both
the severity of the memory.
And how long it lasts in your memory.
And these things get placed
into working memory so
your cognitive processor can process them.
This is like human dynamic ram memory
because it needs to be refreshed.
It dies about every 200ms.
So it needs to be refreshed.
And it has about 70ms access time.
But it's very small.
It only holds about seven chunks,
digits or
words, seven things.
And, again, recency effects are important.
The last thing that goes in the memory
is usually the strongest, and
things start to fade after
a certain amount of time.
And so we can have fun with looking at
working memory, and figuring out how
things are organized in our short-term
working memory that we use to process.
So I can give you a sequence of digits.
Here's a sequence of digits, 25439762608.
And I'll hide those.
Now, what were those numbers?
If you're like me, I can remember
maybe two, three, something or other.
I don't remember any of those digits, and
that's because it overflowed
my working memory.
I couldn't remember that many items for
that long.
Let me take another set of the same number
of items, these are going to be different
items, different numbers, but
the same number of digits.
456 295 1413, and you notice we've
organized them in the chunks.
456 295 1413.
Now I hide them and
I can remember 456 293 1413.
Oops and I got it wrong.
456 295 1413.
456 295 1413.
Because I'm remembering chunks
instead of individual digits.
And you can do the same thing, the same
thing is true for characters and words.
Here's some random characters.
H-E-C A-T-R A-N-U P-T-H E-T-R E-E-T.
If I hide those, I don't know if you can
remember those particular characters.
But, those, I can remember them.
Those characters
are H-E-C-A-T-R-A-N-U-P-T-R-E-T.
And the reason I can remember them
is that if I start with this T and
then go back to the beginning,
this spells out, the cat ran up the tree.
And I can remember the cat ran up
the tree, that's only five words,
where as I'm looking at eighteen
different letters here,
which would over flow my working memory.
So items are processed better
in working memory when we chunk
them together into higher level objects.
Then once things are in our short
term memory, our working memory,
we need to get them in our long term
memory so we can remember them later.
And long term memory is kind of
like the Human World Wide Web.
It's a persistent memory.
It's effectively infinite and
lasts forever.
And there's two types of long term memory.
There's episodic memory and
semantic memory.
Episodic memory is time varying memory.
We remember sequences, events things
that are organized temporally.
This is how we remember songs.
You remember the lyrics.
You may not be able to remember every word
to a song unless you sing the song to get
to that word.
And semantic memory is
memory that's facts, but
they're organized associatively,
there's links.
So you get this stream of consciousness
where you remember one thing, and
then you can remember something related
to that and something related to that.
And so there's various representations for
these kinds of memories,
there's semantic nets which
are really just a graph.
There's frames which are kind
of a database with fields and
entries that you could create relations
and create associations between them, and
then there's scripts which are similar to
frames that basically defined the roles,
scenes, props and so
on for various memories.
So when we go through
the process of remembering,
there's a couple concepts to keep in mind.
One is the total time hypothesis.
And that says that you can remember
something if you spend more time with it.
The more time you spend on something,
the better you are,
the more likely you are to remember it.
This could be memorizing by rote where
you just keep repeating something but
it's not necessarily
best to always repeat and
learn something by repeating it over and
over again.
It's sometimes better
to remember things by
working with them differently but
still spending time on them.
There's the distribution
of practice effect,
which means you can't memorize
a bunch of stuff all at once.
It's better to memorize a few things at
a time, and then go do something else and
then come back and remember a few
things at a time by distributing
the memories over a wider time and
not all at once.
Concrete things are easier to
remember than abstract things, and
so, we remember meanings.
So if I read off the words faith,
age, cold, tenet, quiet,
logic, idea, value, past.
Those are harder to remember.
But if I read off,
because they're abstract concepts.
If I read off more concrete
objects like boat, tree, cat,
child, rug, plate, gun, flame, head.
They tend to paint
a picture in your mind and
it becomes a little bit easier for
you to remember those.
And so we tend to memorize
things based on structure,
based on familiarity,
mostly based on concreteness.
So on the right I've got an example.
If you want to memorize numbers,
if you have the digits one through zero,
effectively one through ten here,
but one through zero.
And you want to memorize a long
sequence of numbers, for example, Pi.
If you remember pi is 3.14159,
if it's difficult
to remember those digits,
those arbitrary digits.
You can make them more concrete
by associating each digit with
a concrete word that rhymes with it.
So instead of three, one, four,
you remember tree, bun, door.
And the words tree, bun,
door start to paint a picture.
And if I go tree, bun, door, bun,
hive, wine, I start to tell
a little bit of a story, and
you can start using more of your episodic
memory to remember these abstract ideas.
We also forget, even when things
are put in our long-term memory.
They will decay over time.
And that decay is logarithmic.
We forget most things earlier and
then we forget fewer things longer away.
This leads to Jost's law.
If you have two equally strong memories,
than the older of the two
memories is the more durable.
If you can remember something,
if you don’t forget
something quickly than your chances of
memorizing it forever are much greater.
And then there’s interference.
One of the reasons we forget things
is that we learn things that
conflict with that memory.
For example there's proactive inhibition.
Which means you can't teach
an old dog new tricks.
If you've learned something one way,
then that one way which has been in your
long-term memory for a long time
is going to be a strong memory.
And it's going to be difficult to rewrite
that memory with new information,
because that old memory is so
much stronger.
And you're more likely to forget
things you've learned more recently.
There's also retroactive interference.
This is when you've just received so
much information.
That you start to forget things
because of the amount of information.
This is, for example,
why it's not good to cram for an exam.
Because you're filling your brain with so
much information that the more recent
information is overriding
the less recent information.
And because the information is less
recent, it's less strong in your memory.
And finally, emotion.
We remember the good old days,
we forget the mundane day to day details
that were boring about the good old days.
You remember things based on strong
emotions and so if you can change your
emotional state when you're studying that
might help, but it might also exhaust you.
But it does have a impact on how you
remember and how you forget things.
So what did we learn?
We learned about memory and
sensory memory, working memory, and
long term memory.
Sensory memory decays quickly but
supports fast sensory processing.
Working memory decays less quickly, but
allows us to do cognitive processing and
the challenges to keeping
things in working memory
are skills that allow us to clump
things into bigger and bigger clumps.
And then long term memories
persist indefinitely.
The challenge there is getting information
from working memory to long term memory.
In a way that it will persist longer.
And, in general, if you want to learn and
remember better,
it's best if you can vary the learning
styles over a longer period of time.
