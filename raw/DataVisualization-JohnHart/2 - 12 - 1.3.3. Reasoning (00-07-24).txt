So when we present a data
visualization to a human observer,
we're going to expect that observer
to think about the information.
So it's useful to understand how a human
observer thinks about information.
So what we'll learn is how does a human
observer understand a visualization.
And how does a human observer
respond to a visualization?
What are they thinking about when they
see this data presented to them visually?
So we use the Model Human Processor, but
we're going to focus on
the Cognitive Processor, and
the information provided to it through the
visual image store and visual perception.
And how we reason about that information.
And there's three kinds of
reasoning that we'll look at.
Deductive Reasoning, Inductive Reasoning,
and Abductive Reasoning.
Deductive reasoning is basically
drawing a conclusion based on the data.
It's based on logic.
If A then B.
So if you see A, then you can
conclude that B is going to exist.
And if B doesn't exist,
you might conclude that A doesn't exist,
because if A happened,
then B would have happened.
So these are all valid logical
conclusions based on visual data.
Sherlock Holmes used to say,
when you have eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains,
however improbably must be the truth.
And that's basically just
the process of elimination.
Which again, is a deductive reasoning
method for drawing a conclusion.
And so for example,
these reasoning examples I'm going to
use this life expectancy data.
This is average data for
all countries in the world and
their life expectancy has grown in
the 1960's from an average 54 years
to an average of about 71 years in 2012.
And so, based on this data I might deduce
that I'm one of the members of one of
the countries that was
used to create this data.
I might expect that my life
expectancy has similarly
increased over the past few decades and
that would be a logical conclusion based
on the information from this graph.
Also, you can see a correlation here
anytime you have a graph
that's increasing this way.
It's showing a correlation between
time and between life expectancy.
And so we're deducing,
we are concluding that life
expectancy is increasing over time.
And so people now days are living longer
than they were a few decades ago.
And that's a reasonable deduction.
We have to be careful that this is
showing correlation and not causation.
And that we're not showing that
because people are growing older,
time is passing necessarily.
There are many other cases where
two items are correlated but
one does not necessarily cause the other.
Or you get the causation
in the wrong direction.
There's also inductive reasoning.
Which basically says if something
is true for x, then it's true for
x +1, and you know that it's true for x.
So, in that case, it's true for all x.
If it's true for one specific case,
it's true for all the cases.
And these are generalizations.
We can use this to extrapolate data.
For example, life expectancy.
I can look at this shape and I might
expect that life expectancy is going
to continue to grow at a rate of about
ten years every decade and a half.
And so we eventually,
we'll live to be 200 years old.
And so some generalizations are helpful.
Some generalizations aren't helpful.
And you have to be careful with
those kinds of extrapolations, also,
interpolation.
I've got this data yearly, but
I'm drawing this as a smooth line,
which is an inductive
reasoning prediction that says
that this is varying smoothly
in between the data items.
It's interpolated, and
it's not varying widely between
an individual year and the next year.
So, inductive reasoning allows
us to infer missing data.
It allows us to extrapolate data,
either before or after the graph.
It's less reliable than deductive
reasoning, but still can be helpful.
And finally, abductive reasoning.
This is based on sort of
the human need for meaning.
To ask why.
So, given this data, that life expectancy,
on average, has been increasing
over the past few decades, we might
start to ask why is that the case?
And we might create models.
And so, in this case, the graph is
increasing almost like a straight line and
so you can do regression.
You can fit a line to this data,
and create a model for this data.
And you can use that model
to replace the data.
And in our minds, we might not think
of every single detail of this data.
And we might think in general
the data is growing at the rate
of our life expectancy is growing at the
rate of ten years every decade and a half.
And those models are good,
but they create a problem.
For example, cognitive dissonance.
It's our ability to entertain simultaneous
contradictory opinions at the same time.
So, it may be difficult for
us to think of two things,
two opposite models, at the same time.
Even though we don't know which model is
correct, and so we tend to take sides.
And if our evidence disagrees with our
models, sometimes the model is so powerful
in our minds that we tend to disregard
the evidence, and that can be dangerous.
And so as we go about with visualization,
we have sort of the baggage of our models.
Our expectations of the way
the world works and
our abductive reasoning is trying
to fit this data to those models.
So, what did we learn?
We learned that there's
three kinds of reasoning.
Deductive reasoning which
draws a conclusion.
Inductive reasoning which creates
generalizations, interpolations, and
extrapolations.
And abductive reasoning,
which tries to put meaning behind the data
and tries to create models for the data.
Tries to change the way
we think about the world.
And all of them are important and all of
them are important to keep in mind as you
present information for a visualization.
So that they are applied correctly and
not incorrectly.
