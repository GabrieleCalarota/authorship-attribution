So, often we want to visualize multiple
variables simultaneously, and so
we generate stacked graphs that
can display several variables
changing along the same dimension.
For a bar chart we may want to look at
more than just a single quantitative
dependent variable measured across
an independent variable dimension.
One way of doing this is
with a stacked bar chart.
In this case we can have two or
more dependent variables plotted.
In this case the blue bars
are representing one dependent variable.
And the red bars are representing
a second dependent variable.
And so we're using hue to represent
different nominal value, basically
the second dependent variable is different
than the first dependent variable.
And then the total amount of
the contribution of both variables
is represented by the height of these
bars, of the top of these stacked bars,
and the relative proportion
is being represented by
the proportion of the bar being
one color versus another color.
If we want to emphasize that relative
proportion, we can have the bars stacked
to 100% and just plot the percentage of
the contribution of one variable verses
the other variable as the difference
in the colors of the bars.
This kind of relative contribution
is also represented in a pie chart.
But in a pie chart you're representing
the contribution based on angle,
and a little bit by area
then on position and length.
Here in a pie chart, the relative
proportion of the blue category, versus
the orange category, versus the green
category, versus the yellow category,
is being represented by the angle,
as the angle sum to 360 degrees.
It's also proportional to the area
represented by each of these four regions.
That indication can be degraded
somewhat if you try to
show a pie chart in three dimensions.
And that's because in three dimensions,
we're still perceiving three dimensional
scene as a two dimensional image.
And the visual cues we're using include
foreshortening and perspective, and those
cues can get in the way of our ability to
perceive a region say in the foreground
as being larger or smaller than a region
in the background, because of our
expectation that perspective is going to
make regions in the foreground larger.
Or at least appear larger, and
regions in the background appear smaller,
even if it's just an orthographic,
non-perspective projection.
So it's best not to use three
dimensions for pie charts.
And in fact, it's better just to use a
stacked bar chart instead of a pie chart.
In this case, each one of these bars
can represent a separate pie chart,
because it's representing the separate
relative contribution to the whole of
multiple dependent variables as they
vary across some independent variable.
Also stacking order matters.
I've got the same data plotted
in the left and in the right.
In the left,
I've plotted the blue variable first.
And then I've stacked the red
variable on top of that.
On the right side,
I've plugged the red variable first, and
I stacked the blue
variable on top of that.
On the right it's easy to see that
the red variable isn't changing
across the horizontal axis.
On the left, you can still see that
the red variable isn't changing, but
you have to see that because
the lengths aren't changing.
Whereas on the right,
the actual positions aren't changing,
which further verifies that position
is a stronger indicator than length of
the actual data values in terms of mapping
to geometric and spacial display elements.
You can avoid that stacking order problem
by using diverging stack bar charts.
If you have the red variable
creating bars growing upwards and
the blue variable creating
bars growing downward.
But that stops working when you
have three or more variables.
Another way to avoid having one variable
dominate the other in stacking order,
is to stack them and then recenter
the bar across the horizontal axis,
so instead of growing up
from the horizontal axis,
the bar is just centered
at the horizontal axis.
And this gives us the same
displacement on the top and
the bottom of the bar chart.
But it helps us to pay more
attention to the areas
of the elements instead
of their actual position.
It's much better if you have continuously
changing horizontal and vertical
axis variables to use stacked line
graphs then stacked bar charts.
If we can connect our data values by
lines instead of having them discrete
bars then it's easier to see
when areas are changing,
versus areas remaining
constant as they move across,
even though they're displaced by
the variance of other variables.
So that kind of stacked graph
layout can be taken even further
If we let each data value be denoted by f,
so,
if f one is the first variable, f two
is the second variable, all the way to,
you know, i variables, or more variables
then we can see this how earlier data,
the data that we plot first can influence
the data we plot later on top of it
by this equation, that says that
the absolute position of a bar,
or a line vertically is represented by g,
i.
That's the ith data item in a stack
is equal to the position
of the bottom of the bar.
Plus the first data item,
plus the second item,
all the way through to the ith data item.
So our position at g,i,
is equal to g,0, plus f, 1,
f,2, f,3, f,4, f,5, f,6, f.7, and so on.
All the way to f, i.
And you can see that the items
at the bottom of this chart,
can skew our perception of
the items at the top of this chart.
Because they're variance gets
carried over in the stacking.
There was a nice solution
to this called theme river.
That basically centered the vertical axis.
It basically set g, 0, the bottom of the
bar, equal to 1/2 of the total bar width.
And now no single bar is
necessarily responsible for
skewing the rest of the bars.
You can still see some skew
in the bar due to variance.
For example here we have a data item,
that kind of popped up between
these two data items and
it's shearing the representation
around it, the mapping around it.
But not to the effect that we saw before.
If we look at what the effect of this
recentering of a stacked bar chart
does in this continuous version,
it ends up minimizing
the total height of the chart
from the top to the bottom.
And it also minimizes the slopes that
you get at the top and the bottom.
Certainly more than if
you started at zero and
only worked upwards,
instead of starting instead of
re-centering the width each,
the width of each bar.
