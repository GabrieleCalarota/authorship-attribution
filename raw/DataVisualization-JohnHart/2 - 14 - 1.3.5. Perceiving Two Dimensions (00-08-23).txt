So as we present data visually to
an observer to a human observer,
we want to make sure that that
data is perceived correctly.
And that means that the data
that's sensed by the rods and
cones in our retina, ends up being
processed further by our perceptual
system before it even gets
to our cognitive system.
How can we make sure that the visual
data is going to be presented so
that it's perceived properly and
correctly?
So in the model human processor, this
data that's coming from the human retina
goes through a visual image store
where it goes through significant
perceptual processing before
you even think about it.
Before you even realize
what you're looking at.
And this perceptual processing starts
right after the data's been
sensed by the rods and cones.
This is an image from Grey's Anatomy.
And you can see that as soon as the data
has been sensed, we've got other cells.
These nerves called ganglia
that are processing the data.
In this case a horizontal cell is
actually comparing the results of
what's being sensed by the rods and
the cones.
And this helps us to detect patterns and
accentuate and
exaggerate differences
in neighboring sensors.
This helps us detect edges, and
motion, and tigers hiding in the bush.
Because tigers hiding in the bush will
create patterns in our peripheral vision,
and those patterns can change over time.
And these horizontal cells
that are comparing and
exaggerating those differences
call tell us to then run away.
So for example,
when we see a shade of gray,
we see that in context of
the surrounding shades of gray.
And so here we have a gray color,
surrounded by a lighter gray color.
And here we have a gray color
surrounded by a darker gray color.
And this box looks like
it's darker than this box.
So this is a darker shade
of gray than this gray.
When in fact those two shades of gray are
identical, they're the same shade of gray.
It's just when we surround them with
these boxes in different contexts,
our perceptual system will accentuate
the difference and make this gray look
darker and this gray look brighter when
in fact they're the same shade of gray.
This also works with color.
And so on the left block I,
you can see that these two
block Is are the same color.
But here the color appears lighter,
because these squares
are next to white squares.
And here they appear darker because
these squares are next to green squares.
And you can also demonstrate
this with mach bands.
Here I've got a gradation
from dark gray to light gray.
And here I've got a plot of basically
the number of photons coming from each of
these bands, to our eye.
And in fact, what our rods and
cones are sensing for
each one of these bands is
proportional to this graph.
What's actually being sent to our brain
from our perceptual system though looks
like this.
And you can see that this flat gray
rectangle next to this
lighter gray rectangle.
This darker rectangle gets darker here and
this lighter rectangle is lighter here.
There's actually,
you can see it get lighter here and
that's not because I've changed any color.
This is all the same shade of gray.
It's that our visual system
is making this shade of gray brighter
because it's next to a darker color.
And our visual system wants to
accentuate the existence of this edge
when these two shades
are very close to each other.
And this can cause problems too.
In this case we've got
the lateral inhibitors,
which are these cells comparing
neighboring rod and cone values.
In our peripheral vision,
if I look at any one of these junctions,
I see a solid gray color.
But the junction's neighboring cells start
to flicker black and white because of
this lateral inhibition of our perceptual
system trying to accentuate those edges.
This also works with orientations,
our perception of orientation is also
based on sort of this local comparison.
And so
these lines look like they're diverging.
It looks like these two parallel lines
are getting farther apart as I move this
direction because they are the sum
of all of these intersections that
are slightly askew from these cubes.
But if I remove these cubes, you see
that these lines really are parallel,
and the perception that those lines
are not parallel is basically because of
adding up all of those misperceptions of
orientations due to the offset cubes.
Similarly, I can take this diamond
shape made from four straight lines.
And if I superimpose on top of these four
straight lines of this diamond shape
a bunch of concentric circles,
this diamond shape,
these lines start to look
like they are bowed inside.
And that's because the orientation of
this line is based on our perception
of the orientations relative
to these concentric circles.
And we get this bowing effect.
At a much higher level,
it can also confuse our cognitive system.
In this case,
we have an eight by eight block of shapes,
and that should give us
64 units squared of area.
If I take these very same shapes and
reorganize them here, I'm now covering
a 13 by 5 area which gives
me 65 unit squares of area.
And so somehow I've taken the same
shape with the same area and
gotten an extra unit square
of area on the right.
And the reason is the accuracy of
our perception of orientation.
We have basically this triangle's angle
going into this rhombus' angle here.
And the slope of these triangles
is basically three-eighths and
the slope of these quadrilaterals, this
edge of this quadrilateral, is two-fifths.
And two-fifths is just not
equal to three-eighths, but
we just don't see the difference.
We also see size in context.
And so, here, I have two blue disks.
This blue disk is sitting
amid some small yellow disks.
And this blue disk is sitting
amidst some large yellow disks.
And this blue disk looks
large as a result.
And this blue disk looks
small as a result.
But in fact they are the same size.
And so
we see things in context because of these
local comparisons that our
perceptual system does.
So what did we learn?
We learned that our perceptual system
performs lateral inhibition, and
other temporal processing and
other processing at low levels and
higher levels in order to see and
accentuate differences in color,
in size, in orientation.
And it does so
in the context of neighboring shapes.
So this lateral inhibition helps us,
for example,
when we're trying to survive in
the jungle with tigers in the bush.
But it can also interfere with
our perception of visual data.
And so when you present visual data,
you need to be sensitive that these
illusions can occur and
to try to avoid them when you can.
And to provide consistent context for
visual comparisons.
