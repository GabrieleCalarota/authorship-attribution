[SOUND] When we use three dimensional
graphics for data visualization,
we're going to depend on photorealism
to help us understand the data.
We're going to use photorealistic shading
methods with three-dimensional graphics,
in order to make visualizations
easier to understand.
Because we're going to use
these shading methods,
these photorealism methods in order to
add depth to a two-dimensional image, so
that we understand it's depicting
a three-dimensional scene.
So photorealism describes visual cues that
tell our perceptual system that when it
sees a two-dimensional image, it's seeing
a depiction of a three-dimensional scene.
Some of these cues are occlusion.
Occlusion is shown here.
The fact that this boy's hand
is in front of the frame.
It starts to trigger
your perceptual system
to think that this is a three-dimensional
scene of a boy climbing out of
the frame instead of a two-dimensional
image of a boy on a frame.
Other things like perspective,
the fact that this water's receding
into the horizon, and details are getting
closer together in the distance.
Others like lighting,
the light bouncing off the forehead
of this boy, or attenuation,
that the water is becoming whiter as
the fog is attenuating the light.
All of these add cues so
that your perceptual system That's looking
at a two-dimensional image can understand
that it's actually a three-dimensional
scene that's being depicted.
One of the strongest cues
of these is occlusion.
For example, this red orange rectangle
is in front of this blue rectangle.
Because you can see all of
this red orange rectangle,
you can't see all of this blue
rectangle because it's being occluded.
This sets up a depth ordering, we don't
know much closer the red orange rectangle
is to us from the blue rectangle,
but we do know that it is closer.
And occlusion is the strongest cue, and
it's fun to play with it with optical
illusions because of that strength.
Illumination helps us perceive
the orientation of surfaces and
there's two kinds of illuminations
that we tend to use.
One is diffuse illumination, which is
brightest when a surface is facing a light
source and
we usually see this from soft objects.
Rough objects, things like cloth or
pencil erasers or
other surfaces that are scattering
light in many directions.
And then there's specular illumination and
that adds these white highlights and
we usually see these on shiny objects,
metallic objects.
And these highlights are added in
regions of the surface that are facing
in a mirror direction, that would reflect
the light source towards the eye.
And so we can combine these when
we're doing data visualization.
This is an example of particles
that are leaving trails to show
a simulation of the flow of
blood in the abdominal aorta.
And we're using certain cues, for
example, occlusion that some of these
trails are in front of other trails.
You can see this green trail
is in front of the blue trail.
We're using lighting because you can
see that these trails are cylindrical,
they have a brighter side and a darker
side because of diffused lighting.
Also we're seeing perspective,
we see larger things here and
smaller things, more details, in the back.
And all of those add up to
give you a better sense
of the shape of this aorta and
the blood flow inside of it.
There's some other cues that
are important, one is shadowing.
Shadowing is an occlusion cue from
a second viewpoint where that second
viewpoint is at the light source.
So here I've got two
two-dimensional images.
In both cases, we can think of these,
due to perspective,
as a flat blue plane with
a red-orange ball on top of it.
But we don't know if this red-orange
ball is hovering over the middle of
the plane or if it's laying on
the plane towards the back of it.
If I add a shadow,
you can see on the left case here,
the red-orange ball is laying on
the blue plane towards its back.
But, in this case, which is the exact
same image, I've just changed the shadow.
We can see that this blue ball is hovering
over the middle of the blue square.
And so in, for example,
this visualization of a molecule,
you can use these shadows to get a better
sense of depth due to the directions
that these shadows are being cast from
an understood light source direction.
There's also perspective, in addition to
being able to see more detail far away
with perspective,
perspective is based on size constancy.
That objects are the same size,
but farther ones appear smaller.
You don't think that the object
is changing its size.
You understand that the visual system
is looking at a larger
area that's farther away.
Because of the way it gets
projected onto our retina or
to our image plane in the case
of computer graphics.
In computer graphics,
the way we do this is we actually make
things that are farther away smaller.
And make things that are closer to us
larger by actually moving the vertices and
then projecting onto a projection plane.
And so, to get this perspective view
where you've got the front of the table
larger than the back of the table.
What we've actually done is
actually made the primitives
of the table larger in the front and
smaller in the back.
But computer graphics does this for
you automatically, so
you don't have to actually do this.
And so, these examples are demonstrated
in this animation from
the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications on an F3 tornado.
And you can see we're using perspective.
The perspective allows us to see
the glyphs in the front of this
visualization and also the patterns that
these glyphs form as you go father away.
And so this is a storm chaser view and
you can see the occlusions of these
arrows, so you can get a sense.
And the arrows are larger in the front and
smaller in the back so
you can get a sense of the depth of
this simulation of this tornado and
the paths that these
particles are tracing.
And also we see shadows on the ground,
shadows being cast from
one primitive to another.
And also the lighting that these
primitives are illuminated on one side
better than they're illuminated,
or more brightly than on another
side to give you a sense that the shape
of these arrows are cylindrical.
Also, as the storm chaser
moves through the data set,
things in the front are moving by
the viewer faster than things in the back.
That's another 3D cue
called motion parallax.
And finally there's stereo, we can use
stereo in the absence of other cues.
In this case, I was just plotting points
of a mathematical equation to create some
shapes.
And the way you visualize this is you
hold your finger up in front of your
two eyes and try to cross your eyes.
So that your right eye is
looking at the left image, and
your left eye is looking
at the right image.
Basically by focusing on
the finger until those two images
in the background start to merge together.
If you do that, then you get a stereogram
and this two-dimensional set of points on
this image plane should pop out into
a three-dimensional configuration.
If you want to simulate this,
then you can simulate this with two
separate views of you from a left eye and
a view from a right eye,
looking in parallel at the data.
Just make sure you don't
rotate those views and
you want to make sure
the views are in parallel.
So what did we learn?
We learned that occlusion is
the strongest of all the depth cues and
that shadowing is an occlusion from
a a viewpoint at the light source.
Illumination is useful for surface
orientation that helps reveal details.
And perspective gives us different
scales of visualization in
addition to adding depth perception.
And when none of these
cues are available to us,
sometimes some of
the other cues can be used.
For example, stereo, we can use
stereo in the absence of other cues.
In this case, I was just plotting points
of a mathematical equation to create some
shapes.
And the way you visualize this is you hold
your finger up in front of your two eyes
and try to cross your eyes.
So that your right eye is
looking at the left image and
your left eye is looking
at the right image.
Basically by focusing on
the finger until those two images
in the background start to merge together.
If you do that, you get a stereogram, and
this two-dimensional set of points on
this image plane should pop out into
a three-dimensional configuration.
If you want to simulate this, then you can
simulate this with two separate views.
A view from a left eye, and
a view from a right eye,
looking in parallel at the data.
Just make sure you don't
rotate those views.
You want to make sure
the views are in parallel.
So, what did we learn?
We learned that occlusion is
the strongest of all the depth cues and
that shadowing is an occlusion from
a viewpoint at the light source.
Illumination is useful for surface
orientation that helps reveal details.
And perspective gives us different scales
of visualization in addition to adding
depth perception.
And when none of these cues
are available to us sometimes some of
the other cues can be used,
for example stereo.
