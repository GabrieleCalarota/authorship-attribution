Corresponding to a matrix, there is a 
function. 
If the matrix is an R by C matrix then 
the function maps F to the C for some 
field F to F to the R. 
And the function is the function defined 
by the rule f applied to a vector y is a 
times y. 
Now, let's consider two matrices, a and 
b, that we're going to multiply together. 
These define functions as well. 
A defines the same function f of y is a 
times y. 
B defines a function, we'll call it G. 
G applied to a vector X is B times the 
vector X, and we'll define h of x to be 
the function corresponding to the matrix 
product A times B. 
That is, h is the function that takes a 
vector X to A times B times x. 
Now, there's something interesting about 
the relationship between these functions. 
Here's an example. 
Let's start with this matrix. 
The corresponding function multiplies a 
vector by the matrix. 
And this has the effect of adding the 
second element to the first element. 
Let's take B to be this matrix. 
Here's the corresponding function that 
multiplies the vector by the matrix. 
And this has the effect of adding the 
first element to the second element. 
Now, let's take the product of these two 
matrices. 
Here is the product. 
This corresponds to a function as well. 
Multiplies this vector by this matrix. 
And the result is here. 
Now, if we take the composition of the 
two functions, f and g, and apply that to 
a vector, it looks like this. 
We apply g first to the vector x1 x2, 
getting x1 and x1 plus x2. 
Then, we apply f to the result. 
We get the vector 2x 1 plus x2, and x1 
plus x2. 
And this exactly matches the output of 
the function h on input x1, x2. 
So this illustrates this idea that the 
composition of functions corresponds to 
multiplication of matrices. 
Let's see a formal proof, however. 
For the proof, let the columns of B be 
the vectors b1 through bn. 
Now, by the matrix-vector definition of 
matrix-matrix multiplication, column j of 
the matrix product, AB, is A times column 
j of the matrix B. 
So, let's take a vector x, let's say its 
entries are x1 through xn. 
Applying the function g to x is the same 
as multiplying x by B. 
By the linear combinations definition of 
matrix vector multiplication, we can 
write this vector as the linear 
combination of the columns of b, where 
the coefficients are given by the entries 
of x. 
Now, let's apply f to g of x, f of g of x 
is f of this linear combination. 
Using the properties of linear functions, 
we can replace this by this. 
We basically move the function in, move 
the coefficients and the sums out. 
And now, using the definition of f, we 
can replace f of b1 by a times b one, f 
of bn by a times bn. 
And now, using the matrix vector 
definition of matrix-matrix 
multiplication, column 1 of AB is A times 
column 1 of B, which is A times B1. 
Similarly, column N of the product AB is 
the same as A times column N of B, which 
is BN. 
Now, using the linear combinations 
definition of matrix vector 
multiplication, the linear combination of 
these columns, can be written as a matrix 
vector product. 
The, the matrix AB times the vector x, 
whose entries are the coefficients. 
And this by definition is the result 
applying h to the vector x. 
So, that proves, that proves the 
property. 
So, we've seen that matrix-matrix 
multiplication corresponds to composition 
of functions. 
And this gives us a nice corollary. 
Matrix, matrix multiplication is 
associative. 
What that means is, in taking the product 
of three matrices, A, B, and C, you can 
first take the product of the first two 
and then multiply it by the third. 
Or you can take the product of the second 
and third, and then multiply it by the 
first. 
You get the same result. 
The proof is very simple. 
Function composition is associative, 
therefore matrix-matrix multiplication is 
associative. 
Here's an example. 
Three matrices. 
Let's say, first we take the product of 
the second and third, getting this one, 
then we take the product of the first and 
we end up with this matrix. 
We could also first take the product of 
the first and the second, getting this 
matrix, and then multiply that by the 
third and we get the same matrix.
