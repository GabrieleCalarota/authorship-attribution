Now we've come to one of the most 
critical definitions in the course, 
Dimension. The dimension of a vector 
space is the size of a basis for it. 
And it's written dim V. 
And we define the rank of a set of 
vectors to just be the dimension of the 
Span of those vectors. 
And we write it as rank s. 
So here's an example, these vectors are 
literally dependent. 
So their rank is less than three. 
The, this is not a basis. 
There must be a smaller basis. 
Well, in fact, two of those vectors will 
form a basis. 
So that shows that the rank of this of 
this set of vectors is two. 
Here's another example. 
The vectors face, consisting of the span 
of the zero vector, is spanned by an empty set, and therefore 
the length of this set is zero. 
Now, for a matrix, we defined the row 
length of that matrix to be the rank of 
the rows of the matrix. 
Similarly, we define the column rank to 
be the rank of the columns. 
So another way of saying it is, that the 
row rank of a matrix M is the dimension 
of the row space of M, written row M. 
And the column rank is the dimension of 
the col space of M. 
So here's an example, the rows of this 
matrix, are the vectors we saw before, 
and we saw earlier 
that the rank of those vectors is two. 
So the row rank of this matrix is two. 
And the columns are these vectors. 
And one of these vectors is zero. 
Clearly not needed for spanning. 
So, again, the column rank, so the column 
rank of this matrix is also 2. 
Here's another example. 
Well, this row has a nonzero entry in the 
first column, and none of the others have 
nonzeros in the first column. 
This row has a nonzero in the second 
column, and none of the others do. 
And this one has a nonzero in the third 
column, where none of the others do. 
So these three rows are linearly 
independent. 
Therefore the row rank of M is three. 
The columns are these vectors. 
Now, the first three columns are linearly 
independent, but you can express the 
fourth column as a linear combination of 
the other three. 
So, the column rank of this matrix is 
three. 
Now we've seen it in a couple of examples 
we've looked at. 
The row rank happens to equal the column 
rank. 
And we'll see later that that's not a 
coincidence, it's true in every matrix. 
Now, earlier we asked a fundamental 
question, how can you predict the 
dimensionality of the span of some vectors? 
So now we can answer that question. 
But, we just compute the rank of those 
vectors, and that gives you the 
dimension. 
Now let's look at rank in the context of 
graphs. 
Let T be the set of dark edges. 
Now, a basis for span of T is shown here, 
alright? 
It's not it's linearly independent 
because there are no cycles. 
And it has the same span as the dark 
edges in this graph. 
Since the this basis has size four, the 
rank of t, the set of dark edges in this 
graph, is four, and here's another. 
Basis for the same graph. 
Now let's see how we can use dimension to 
argue about the cardinality of a vector 
space over GF2. 
So now we're working with vectors over 
GF2. 
You remember the checksum problem. 
The checksum function we used was, mapped 
a, an N vector to a 64 vector over GF2 by 
taking dot products with 64 vectors. 
Let p be the original file and let e be 
the transmission error. 
The corrupted version of the file then is 
written as p plus e. 
What we want to know is the probability 
that a corrupted file had the same 
checksum as the original file. 
Well, if this error is chosen according 
to the uniform distribution. 
Distribution, the probability that p plus 
e has the same check sum as p is the same 
as the probability that e is a solution to 
a homogeneous linear system, which is equal to the number of solutions 
to the homogeneous linear system divided by the number of all possible 
vectors e, the number of n vectors. 
And we know the number of n vectors is 2 
to the n, because there are n entries, 
each one can be 0 or 1. 
So in order to find this probability, we 
need to know the number of solutions to a 
homogeneous linear system. 
So this raises the question, how do you 
find the number of solutions to a 
homogeneous linear system over GF2? 
Well the solution set to a homogeneous 
linear system is a vector space. 
So the question becomes how to find out 
cardinality of a vector space over GF2. 
Well, suppose that vector space has a 
basis b1 through bn, those are generators 
for the vector space. 
So the vector space is the set of all 
linear combinations of those vectors. 
The number of linear combinations is 2 to 
the n because there are n coefficients, 
each one can be 0 or 1. 
And by the unique representation Lemma 
every linear combination gives a 
different vector in the vector space. 
So the number of vectors in the vector 
space is also 2 to the n. 
So this shows that the cardinality of a 
vector space V is 2 to the power of the 
dimension of v. 
The cardinality of the vector space. 
Well, it still leaves unanswered the 
question of how to find the dimension of 
the solution set of a homogeneous linear 
system. 
Now, a homogenous linear system can be 
written as a matrix vector equation, Ax 
equals 0. 
And the set of solutions to this is just 
the null space of the matrix A. 
So, we're really asking how can we find 
the dimension of the null space of a 
matrix A? 
And that question will be answered later.
