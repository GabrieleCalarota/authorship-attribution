And in linear algebra, we don't say
perpendicular so much, we say orthogonal.
We're going to define
the notion of orthogonal so
that the Pythagorean Theorem is true.
Let u and v be any vectors.
Their lengths are norm of u and norm of v.
And we draw the corresponding arrows.
The arrow for u, the arrow for v,
and the arrow for the sum, u plus v.
Now, so far, we haven't required that
this triangle be a right triangle.
So in fact,
this is not formally a hypotenuse.
Now the, the squared length.
Of the vector u plus v is
norm of u plus v squared.
Which is, by definition of norm, the inner
product of u plus v with u plus v.
Now we use some of
the properties of inner product.
By linearity of the inner product.
We can break this up as,
being a product of u with u plus v,
plus being a product of v with u plus v.
We can finally break that up,
as being a product of u with u,
u with v, v with u and v with v.
Now, the inner product of u with
u is the norm of u squared.
The inner product of v with
v is the norm of v squared.
And these two terms are really
the same by symmetry.
Two time, combining them we get two
times the inner product of u with v.
Now this last expression is
equal to norm of u squared
plus norm of e squared if and
only if this term is 0.
We want the norm squared of u plus v
to be equal to the norm squared
of u plus the norm squared of v.
If and only if the vectors u and
v are orthogonal.
So we'll define orthogonality in this way.
We defined the two vectors to be
orthogonal if the inner product equals 0.
And then we automatically get
the Pythagorean Theorem for vectors.
If vectors u and v are orthogonal.
Then, the norm squared of u plus
v equals the norm squared of u,
plus the norm squared of v.
We're going to use orthogonality to
help us solve the fire engine problem.
First, we have to identify some
properties of orthogonality.
If u is orthogonal to v, than u is
orthogonal to any scale or multiple of v.
And if u and
v are both orthogonal to a third vector,
w, than u plus v is is orthogonal to w.
Let's see the proofs.
First we show property 01.
If u is orthogonal to v then u is
orthogonal to any scalar multiple to v.
Okay, so we assume that u and
v are orthogonal.
What's the inner product of u with
a scalar multiple alpha times v?
The inner product can be
rewritten as alpha times uv,
we've just factored out an alpha.
Now, the end product of u with v is 0,
because u and
v are assumed to be orthogonal, so
we have alpha times 0, which is 0.
So that shows that the inner
product of u with alpha v is 0,
which shows that u and
alpha v are orthogonal.
Now, we, if u and
v are both orthogonal to w, we want to
show that u plus v is orthogonal to w.
So what's the inner product
of u plus v with w?
Well, we can use the property of inner
product to split up this inner product as
u, as the inner product of u with w
plus the inner product of v with w.
And each of these inner products is 0,
because we've assumed that u is
orthogonal to w and v is orthogonal to w.
We get a sum of zero plus zero, showing
that this inner product is also zero.
So u plus v is orthogonal to w for
example.
The inner product that is the dot product
of this vector U with this this vector V
is zero.
So, the inner product, the dot product of
U with ten times this vector is also zero.
Here's an example of the second property.
We see that the inner
product of this vector U.
With this vector w is zero.
And that the inner product of this
vector v with w is also zero.
And we can combine these to get that
the inner product of the sum of
these two vectors with w is zero.
So the sum is orthogonal to w.
Now let's see how orthogonality can
help solve the fire engine problem.
We start with a vector b.
That represents the location
of the burning house.
And a vector a that gives us
the line that the road goes along.
So the line is the set of set of
scalar multiples of the vector a.
Now, let p be the point on that line
such that b minus p is orthogonal to a.
Then that's the point on
the line that's closest to b.
As example, suppose the line is just the x
axis, that is the set of pairs x, y.
Such that y is equal to 0.
And let the point b be b1, b2.
So it looks like this.
The lemma states that
the point on the line
that's closes to b is the point b1, 0.
And let's see why that should be.
For any other point q,
these three points form a triangle.
Now, it's a right triangle because,
because we chose p,
so that b minus p is
orthogonal to this line.
Since q is different from p.
The length of the base is non-zero.
So, by the Pythagorean Theorum, the
hypotenuse's length squared equals the sum
of the square of the length of the height,
and the square of the length of the base.
But since the base, the length of the base
is non-zero, that shows that the length of
the hypotenuse squared is greater than
the length of the height squared.
That means that the distance from b to q,
is greater than the distance from b to p.
Let's see this in greater generality.
Let q be any point on the line.
Now the points q, p, and
b form this triangle.
Now, p and q are both on the line.
So they're both multiples of a.
So, their difference p minus
q is also a multiple of a.
Now b minus p is orthogonal to a.
Therefore, it's orthogonal to p minus q,
which is a multiple of a.
That's using one of the properties
of orthogonality we proved earlier.
So, by the Pythagorean Theorem,
the length squared of the hypotenuse.
That is, the length of b minus
q squared equals the sum
of the squares of a length of b minus p,
and p minus q.
If q is not equal to p then
the length of the base is non-zero.
Which shows that the length
of the hypotenuse is greater
than the length of the height.
Which shows that b is farther
from q than it is from p.
So, the Lemma states that.
Among all the points on the line,
the closest point to b
is the point on the line such that
b minus p is orthogonal to a.
Now to simplify all of this we
introduce a new definition.
For any vector b and any vector a,
we define two vectors.
I call this one b parallel to a,
and this one b perpendicular to a.
These are called the projection of b onto
span of a, or the projection of b along a.
And the projection of b orthogonal to a.
And the defining equations
are this b has to
be the sum of b parallel and
b perpendicular.
And there has to be a scalar sigma,
such that b parallel is a,
is sigma times a.
And finally be perpendicular
has to be orthogonal to a.
So, you should think of this as
breaking b up into a sum of two parts,
b parallel and b perpendicular,
satisfying these properties.
Another way of stating
the fire engine lemma is this.
For any vector b and
vector a ver the reals.
The point in the span of
a that is closest to b
is the projection of b onto span of a.
And the distance between that point and
b is the norm of b perpendicular.
The norm of the projection
of the orthogonal to a.
Let's look at a simple example of this.
What if a is the zero vector?
If a is the 0 vector,
then the only vector b parallel to
a satisfying this equation
is the 0 vector, as well.
No matter what you multiply the 0 vector
by you're still going to get the 0 vector.
Now, according to the first
equation if b parallel to a is
the 0 vector, then b perpendicular
to a must be equal to b.
But that satisfies this third equation.
That is,
b perpendicular is orthogonal to a.
Because, after all, a is the 0 vector.
For, so every vector has an inner
product of 0 with the 0 vector.
Every vector is orthogonal
to the zero vector.
Now what's the point in span of
the 0 vector it's closest to b.
Well, the span of the 0 vector
contains only one point,
namely the 0 vector itself.
So that has got to be the closest point.
And the distance is the norm
of b perpendicular.
Well, in that case,
that's the norm of b itself.
All right, we're going to try to figure
out how to compute the parallel and
the perpendicular.
These are the three equations that
have to be satisfied by these vectors.
We've already seen that if
a is the 0 vector then b
parallel is also the 0 vector.
So let's consider the case
where a is not the 0 vector.
We need to find the sigma for
which b parallel equals sigma times a.
By the third equation b perpendicular
to a has to be orthogonal to a.
Therefore the inner product of b
perpendicular with a must be 0.
Now let's substitute for
b perpendicular using this equation.
B perpendicular is just
b minus b parallel.
So we require that b minus b parallel,
have an inner product with a of 0.
Now we use this equation to substitute for
b parallel.
The inner product of b minus
sigma times a with a, must be 0.
Using homogeneity of inner product.
This equation in is
the same as this equation.
The inner product of b with a,
minus sigma times the inner
product of a with itself equals 0.
And this gives us the value of sigma.
Sigma is the ratio of
the inner product of b with a,
to the inner product of a with itself.
And in the special case
where the norm of a is 1,
the denominator,
the inner product of a with itself, is 1.
So sigma is the inner product of b with a.
Now let's use the procedure
project along to
write the procedure project orthogonal 1.
It takes vectors b and
a, and returns the projection of b
orthogonal to a, b perpendicular.
The solution is just to take b and
subtract the projection of b along a.
The quiz is to write Python code for
project.along b, a,
which is supposed to return
the projection of b along a.
Here's the first answer you might
give it returns sigma times a.
There's a problem with this in
the case when a is the 0 vector.
In that case, we have a divide by 0.
So the best answer looks like this.
It re, it returns a multiple of a,
and that multiple sigma is either
this ratio of inner products,
if a is not the zero vector.
But if it is the zero vector
the coefficient is 0.
Mathematically the implementation of
project_along we've given is correct.
However, because of
floating-point roundoff error,
we have to make a change to this.
Often the vector a will not be a truly
9 vector but, practically it will be 0.
If the entries of a are tiny, the
procedure should treat a as a zero vector.
In other words,
sigma should be assigned 0 in that case.
And the resulting vector
should be the 0 vector.
We'll consider a to be a 0
vector if its squared norm is n
more than some tiny number,
say 10 to the minus 20.
So here's a revised version of
the implementation of project along.
Now we return at last to
the fire engine problem.
We'll take the vector a to be the 6,
2, and
the vector b as the location
of the house 2, 4.
The closest point on the line consisting
of all scalar multiples of a.
Is the point b parallel to a which
is sigma times a, where sigma is
the ratio of the inter product of a with
b to the inter product of a with itself.
We calculate that.
It turns out to be one half.
Therefore, the,
the point closest to b is one half
times the vector a which is 3, 1.
And the distance to b is the norm of
the projection of b orthogonal to a.
Which turns out to be square root of 10.
Which is just under 3.5,
the length of the fire hose.
The house is saved.
Now this fire engine problem can be
restated as finding the vector on
the line that best approximates
the given vector b.
And by best approximates
we just mean closest.
But this notion of best
approximation comes up again and
again in linear algebra.
In least-squares, which is
a fundamental data analysis technique.
In image compression,
in principle components analysis, and
in something called
latent semantic analysis.
In the next part of the course we'll
address the problem of these squares.
The fire engine problem can be stated in
this way, given a vector b and a vector a,
find the vector in span of the set
consisting just of a that's closest to b.
Now a natural generalization
of this problem is as follows.
Given a vector b and
a bunch of vectors, a1 through an,
find the vector in span of the set
consisting of a1 through an closest to b.
That's the next topic we study.
