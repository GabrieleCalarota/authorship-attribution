Now, we're going to study the 
relationship between a matrix m and the 
function that maps a vector x to M times 
x. 
Now, in one direction, it's pretty easy. 
Given a matrix M, we can define the 
function. 
Maps x to M times x. 
And the more interesting thing is going 
the other way. 
Given a function, can we find the matrix 
M such that that function maps x to M 
times x? 
In studying this relationship, we come up 
with this fundamental idea of linear 
functions. 
Let's go the easy direction first. 
We start with a matrix M and we define 
the function f of x to be f of x equal M times 
x. 
Now, what are the domain and co-domain of 
this function? 
Let's say M is an R by C matrix over the 
field F. 
Then, the domain of F is F to the C, 
because the input to the function has to 
have as its domain, the label set of the 
matrix. 
Similarly, the output of the function is 
a vector with domain R. 
So, the co-domain of the function F is 
the field to the R. 
For this matrix, the function f of x 
equals M times x has a domain of R to to 
the set sharp, at, and question mark. 
And the co-domain is R to the a and b. 
So, for example, given this as input. 
This is the output. 
Here's another example, given this define 
this function as this matrix times the 
input. 
Then, the domain of the function is R3 
the co-domain is R2. 
And for example, it maps this input to 
this output. 
Now, let's say we have a function and we 
want to compute a matrix M such that the 
function is f of x equals M times x. 
Okay, we know that the domain, let's say 
the domain is F to the A. 
So, we know the input is an A vector. 
So, for the product M times x to be even 
legal, we need the column-label set of M 
to be the set A. 
Similarly, since the co-domain is F to 
the B, we know that the output is a B 
vector, and so we need that the row label 
set of M is the set b. 
So, we know that M must be a B by A 
matrix. 
Now, what are the entries of M? 
We have a function f, and let's say its 
domain is Fn and its co-domain is fm. 
We think there might be a matrix. 
Big M, such that f of x is the equal to M 
times x. 
How can we find out what the entries of 
this matrix are? 
Well, we start by writing this mystery 
matrix in terms of its columns. 
So, let's say those columns are indicated 
as V1 through Vn. 
Now, we use the standard generators. 
Remember, the first standard generator is 
1 and the rest of the entries are 0. 
The second is 0 and then 1, and then the 
rest are 0 and so on. 
So, we combine standard generators with 
the linear combinations definition of 
matrix vector multiplication. 
So, f of e1 is the matrix times the 
vector e1. 
And by the by the linear combinations 
definition of matrix vector 
multiplication, this product is just the 
first column, V1. 
Similarly, f of en is just the last 
column, Vn. 
Let's take a simple example. 
The function that stretches by two in the 
horizontal direction. 
Okay, and we assume this function is 
defined as a matrix vector multiplication 
for some matrix M and we want to figure 
out what it's entries are. 
Well, we plug in the, we plug in the 
standard generators. 
First standard generator is 1, 0. 
We plug in 1, 0, we know that point gets 
mapped to 2, 0, because we're stretching 
by two in the horizontal direction. 
Now, we plug in the second standard 
vector, 0, 1. 
And we know this maps to 0, 1, because 
we're not doing any stretching in the 
vertical direction. 
So, we know S, applied to the first 
standard generator, is 2, 0 and we know S 
applied to the second standard generator 
is 0, 1. 
So, we take these two vectors and we 
build a matrix with those as its columns. 
That's the matrix M, 2, 0 as its first 
column and 0, 1 as its second column. 
Let's try another example, rotation by 90 
degrees. 
So, let r be the function that rotates 
the point, x, y by 90 degrees, like this. 
And we assume that r can be defined by 
matrix vector multiplication for some 
matrix M. 
And we'll try to figure out what the 
entries are. 
Now, we know that rotating the standard 
generator 1, 0 by 90 degrees gives us 0, 
1. 
So, the function should map the standard, 
first standard generator 1, 0 to 0, 1. 
And we know that, rotating the second 
standard generator 0, 1 by 90 degrees 
should give us minus 1, 0. 
So, the function should map 0, 1 to minus 
1, 0. 
Since the first standard generator maps 
to 0, 1 and the second standard generator 
maps to minus 1, 0, we build the matrix 
by making these its columns. 
And there it is. 
Now, we consider a generalization of the 
previous example. 
This time we define r to take a point x, 
y and rotated by an angle of Beta. 
And we assume as before that the function 
is defined by matrix vector 
multiplication for some matrix M. 
Now, we know that rotating the first 
standard generator 1 0 by an angle of 
theta should give us The point [cos 
theta, sin theta]. 
So, column one of the matrix M should be 
cos, theta, sine theta. 
We know rotating the point 1, 0, the 
second standard generator, by an angle of 
theta, should give us minus sine theta 
cos theta. 
So, column two of the matrix is minus 
sine theta, cos theta, and here is the 
matrix for rotating by an angle of theta. 
Try one more example. 
Translation. 
So, translation by 1, 2, meaning we move 
the input one unit to the right, and two 
units up. 
Assume this function is defined by matrix 
vector multiplication for some matrix M, 
and lets figure out the entries of M. 
We start with the point 1, 0 translate 
it. 
And we get 2, 2. 
So, the first column would have to be 2, 
2. 
We start with the, the second generator 
0, 1 and translate it. 
And we get 1, 3. 
So, the second column of this matrix 
would have to be 1, 3. 
So, the matrix would look like this. 
Here's a simple example. 
Consider the function from R4 to R4 
defined by f of x equals x. 
That's just the identity function. 
Now, let's assume that f of x equals M 
times x for some matrix M, and let's 
figure out what matrix. 
Well, we plug in the standard generators. 
f of e1 equals e1. 
And so, the first column is just e1, 
similarly f of e2 is e2, so the second 
column is e2, f of e3 is e3, so the third 
column is e3, and f of e4 equals e4, so 
the fourth column is e4. 
So, the matrix looks like this. 
This is the identity matrix. 
So, we see that the identity function, f 
of x, corresponds to an identity matrix, 
that's why we call it an identity matrix. 
Let's consider the function from Rn to 
Rn, defined as follow. 
Given a vector x1 through xn, return the 
vector d1x1 through dnxn. 
So, what this function is doing, is 
scaling in each coordinate. 
And the matrix, corresponding to this 
function, has the, has the values d1 
through dn, going down the diagonal. 
This is called a diagonal matrix. 
All the entries off the diagonal are 
required to be 0. 
Now, a special case is where all the 
diagonal elements are 1. 
In that case, the function is the 
identity function and the matrix is the 
identity matrix.
