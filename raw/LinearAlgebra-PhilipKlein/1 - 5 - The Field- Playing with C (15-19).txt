Now, we can interpret the real and 
imaginary parts of a complex number as x 
and y coordinates. 
Thus, we can interpret a complex number 
as a point in the plane. 
In this context, we call it the complex 
plane. 
So, here the complex number z is 
represented as a point. 
It's x-coordinate is it's real part and 
it's y-coordinate its, is it's imaginary 
part. 
Now, I'll illustrate the idea of complex 
numbers as points in a complex plane by 
plotting some complex numbers. 
I'll import a plotting procedure we 
provide and plot this list of numbers. 
Let's plot a longer list of complex 
numbers, one derived from an image. 
I'll first import some image manipulation 
procedures, defined in a module we 
provide. 
And now load an image. 
Now, we find the length of this list 
which is the number of rows and the 
length of one of its elements. 
Just the number of columns. 
Now, we'll define a collection of complex 
numbers based on the intensities of the 
pixels in the image and plot that. 
The plot function takes an optional 
second argument, given the scale of the 
plot. 
And an optional third argument, given the 
size in pixels of the points displayed. 
Once we've interpreted complex numbers as 
points in the plane, we can take 
advantage of geometric properties, like 
length and distance. 
So, we define the absolute value of a 
complex number to be the length of the 
line segment between that complex number, 
represented as a point, and the origin. 
That is it's the distance between that 
point and the origin. 
In math, we would write it with vertical 
bars. 
And in Python, the absolute value of a 
complex number is written abs of complex number of z. Now 
here's a function. 
It maps the input complex number to that 
number plus 1 plus 2i. 
How do we interpret that geometrically? 
The effect of this function is to add 1 
to the real part of z and 2 to the 
imaginary part of z. 
We can think of that as operating on a 
point. 
And getting another point that's one unit 
to the right, and two units up. 
So, applying that function to all these 
points would shift them, up and to the 
right. 
We call a function of this form a 
translation. 
It said to translate a set of points. 
Let's use Python to translate these 
points in L. 
We can serially translate the points from 
the image. 
We'll take this image. 
Translate them so that the image is 
centered at the origin. 
Given the input, it adds a complex 
number, z0, to the input. 
And a translation can move the picture 
anywhere in the complex plane. 
Alright. 
So we can interpret the complex number, 
z0, as representing the translation that 
adds z0 to the input. 
Once we interpret a complex number as a 
translation, we can think of it as an 
arrow in the complex plane. 
The arrow's tail can be located at any 
point z. 
Then the arrow's head is located at z 
plus z0. 
So, the arrow shows an example of how the 
translation acts on a point. 
So, let's try representing this complex 
number as an arrow. 
We can choose anywhere to put its tail 
and one convenient place to put it is at 
the origin. 
So, the tail will be here. 
And the head should be at the location 
with x-coordinate minus 6 and 
y-coordinate 5. 
So, one, two, three, four, five, six. 
One, two, three, four, five. 
So the head should be here. 
So, the arrow would look like that. 
Now, consider two complex numbers. 
Each of them corresponds to a 
translation. 
Let's take the functional composition of 
those two translations. 
So, first we apply f2 to the input, then 
we apply f1. 
That's the same as adding first z2 and 
then z1. 
So, we can represent functional 
composition by adding arrows. 
Here's an example. 
Let's say we're first going to apply f 2. 
So that takes a point. 
Let's start with the origin. 
And translates it three units to the 
right and one unit up. 
One, two, three, one. 
So, that goes here. 
Next, we'll write down the arrow 
representing this complex number. 
This complex number says move two units 
to the right and three units up. 
And we can write it as an arrow with the 
tail located anywhere and a convenient 
place to put the tail is at the head of 
the last arrow. 
So we could have better write here. 
Here is the tail. 
The head will be two units to the right and three units 
up. 
So, this arrow is represented. 
This complex number is represented by 
this arrow. 
Now, what about the functional 
composition? 
The functional composition add z1 plus z2 
to its input. 
You can find that arrow by choosing its 
tail to be the tail of the first arrow, 
and its head to be the head of the second 
arrow. 
So, z1 plus z2 is represented by this 
arrow. 
So, we see that addition of complex 
numbers can be represented by putting 
arrows together. 
Adding them in this way consider the 
operation of multiplying a complex number 
by 0.5. 
What's the geometric interpretation? 
How does this affect arrows representing 
complex numbers? 
So, we're applying the function f of z 
equals 0.5 times z. 
Let's say we start with a complex number 
2 plus 4i. 
We represent that by an arrow that moves 
two units to the right and one, two, 
three, four units up. 
So, this arrow, when we multiply the 
complex number by 0.5. 
What we're doing is multiplying the real 
part by 0.5, halving the real part and 
halving the imaginary part. 
As a consequence, the arrow representing 
that complex number goes one unit to the 
right and two units up. 
It gives you an arrow in the same 
direction but half the length. 
This is called Scaling. 
Let's see what it looks like when we 
scale all the complex numbers in the list 
L and plot them. 
Or the numbers in the list M derived from 
the image. 
What about if we multiply a complex 
number by minus 1? 
Let's try that. 
Let's start with the same complex number 
2 plus 4i. Multiplying this by minus 1. 
means multiplying the real part by minus 
1 and the imaginary part by minus 1. 
So, we end up with minus 2 plus minus 4i, 
which is an arrow that goes in exactly 
the opposite direction. 
[SOUND] So, this is called Reflection. 
Now, we'll multiply each of the points in 
the list L, by negative 1 and plot the 
result. 
And the same for the points in the list 
M. 
How would we rotate by 90 degrees? 
Let's say we start with the complex 
number 2 plus 4i. 
So, that's represented by the arrow that 
goes one, two, three, four. 
Rotating that 90 degrees should give us 
this arrow represented by the arrow that 
goes four units to the left and two units 
up. 
This is the complex number 2 plus 4i. 
This is the complex number minus 4 plus 
2i. 
So, we need a way of mapping. 
From the complex number x plus y i to the 
complex number minus y plus x i. 
How can we do that? 
We use the property of i, that i squared 
is minus one. 
So we multiply i times x plus y i. 
Using the Distributive Law, you get x 
times i plus y times i squared, which is 
x times i minus y. 
So, the function will use for rotating by 
90 degrees is f of z equals i times z. 
What about rotating by another angle? 
Well, let's start with this definition. 
The argument of a complex number is the 
angle, measured in radians, between the 
x-axis and the arrow representing the 
complex number. 
To see how to increase the argument of a 
complex number, we turn to a formula due 
to Euler, a remarkable mathematician. 
Contributed to many areas of mathematics 
not to mention music theory and 
cartography. 
Euler's formula states that for any real 
number theta, e to the theta times i is 
the point z in the complex plane on the 
unit circle whose argument is theta. 
Here e is the famous transcendental 
number, 2.71828 and so on. 
So, here's an exmaple. 
We plug in theta equals pi over 4, which 
corresponds to 45 degrees. 
e to the i times pi divided by 4 is this, 
is this point in the complex plane. 
Notice that the arrow to that point forms 
a 45 degree angle with the x-axis. 
We plug in theta equals pi, that 
corresponds to an angle of 180 degrees. 
So, the complex number is this one, which 
turns out to be minus 1. 
So, e to the i times pi is minus 1. 
Let's form a bunch of complex numbers by 
plugging in multiples of 2 pi over 20 for 
theta in Euler's formula. 
First, we have to get pi and e. 
Now that forms a circle of dots. 
Next, let's try multiplying all these 
complex numbers by 2. 
Let's see how we can use the Euler's 
formula to rotate points by any angle 
tau. 
Any complex number can be written in this 
form. 
z equals r times e to the theta i, where 
r is a real number call which is the 
absolute value of z, and theta is the 
argument of z. 
What we want to do is increase the 
argument of z. 
We'll use the exponentiation law e to the 
a times e to the b is e to the a plus b. 
So, if we start with the complex number 
z, which is r times e to the theta i. 
And we multiply it by e to the tau i. 
By the exponentiation law, that's the 
same as r times e to the theta i plus tau 
i, which is the same as r times e to the 
theta plus tau i. 
So we get a complex number whose absolute 
vallue is the same as the one we started 
with, but whose argument is theta plus 
tau. 
So, the function multiplies by e to the 
tau times i, carries out rotation by an 
angle of tau. 
To illustrate this, we'll rotate all the 
complex numbers in the list L by pi 
divided by 4 radians. 
Basically, 1/8th of the circle, which is 
equivalent to 45 degrees. 
And the same for the complex numbers in 
the list M.
