We continue to look inside the formerly 
black box. 
We studied Gaussian elimination, which is 
used in the modules Solver and 
Independence when working over GF 2. 
And we'll next study the methods used in these 
same modules when working over the real 
numbers. 
There's a burning house located at 
coordinates 2,4. 
Now fortunately, there's a street that 
runs close to the house. 
But is it close enough? 
The street goes through the origin and to 
the point 6,2. 
And the fire engine has a hose 3.5 units 
long. 
So, we can navigate the fire engine to 
the point on the road closest to the 
house. 
But, if we do that, will the distance 
from the fire engine to the house be 
close enough for the hose? 
Well, there, there are two questions that 
we're looking at. 
What point along the street is closest to 
the house, and how far is it? 
And to answer that, we first have to say 
what we mean by closest. 
The distance between two points, p and b, 
is the length of the difference, p minus 
b. 
We first have to define the length of a 
vector. 
Instead of using the term length, we use 
the term norm. 
Now the norm of the vector is written 
with these double vertical bars. 
A norm should satisfy certain properties. 
The norm of a vector should be a non 
negative real number, that's part of what 
we mean by length. 
The norm of a vector should be zero, if 
and only if the vector is the zero 
vector. 
And the norm should scale, that is, if 
you scale a vector by a, an amount alpha, 
then that should change the vector itself 
by the absolute value of alpha. 
And finally, norm should satisfy 
something called the triangle inequality. 
So, one way to define a norm for vectors 
is to first define s, an operation on 
vectors called inner product. 
Which is written this way, the inner 
product of u with v. 
The inner product itself has to satisfy 
certain axioms and we're going to get to 
those soon. 
One thing to note, though, is there is no 
way to define an inner product for the 
field GF 2, so we're going to have to say 
goodbye to GF 2. 
Now, for the real and complex numbers, we 
can define an inner product. 
In fact, there's some flexibility in how 
we define the inner product and that 
flexibility is very useful in 
applications. 
Once we've defined an inner product, we 
get a norm. 
The norm of a vector is the square root 
of the inner product of the vector with 
itself. 
For simplicity, we'll focus on the field 
of real numbers, and we use the most 
natural and convenient definition of 
inner product. 
And that definition will lead to the 
norm, being what you think of as the 
length of of a vector. 
That is, the geometric length of its 
arrow. 
So, for vectors over the reels we'll 
define the inner product of u and v to be 
just the dot product of u and v. 
The inner product has several properties. 
It's linear in the first argument which 
means the inner product of u plus v with 
w is the inner product of u with w plus 
the inner product of v with w. 
It's symmetric, that is the inner product 
of u with v is the same as the inner 
product of v with u and it satisfies 
homogeneity. 
Which means the inter product of alpha u 
with v equals alpha times the inter 
product of u with v. 
And it's easy to prove these properties 
when we define our inner product to just 
be dot product. 
All right, so we've defined inner product 
to be dot product. 
And we've defined the norm of a vector to 
be the square root of the inner product 
of a vector with itself. 
Do we thereby get the norm properties? 
Does our norm behave like a distance? 
Let's write a vector v in terms of it's 
entries, v1 through vn. 
Then, the norm of that vector v is just 
the square root of the sum of the squares 
of the entries. 
Now, the sum of squares is a nonnegative 
real number. 
Then, we take the square root, we still 
get a non-negative real number. 
So in fact, the norm of v is a 
nonnegative real number. 
That's the first property. 
Now, if any entry of the vector v is 
nonzero, then this sum of squares is 
bigger than zero. 
So, the norm is non-zero in that case. 
That shows that the norm satisfies the 
second property. 
I'll go through the proof of the third 
property. 
Let's look at the norm squared of alpha 
times v. 
That's the inner product of alpha times v 
with alpha times v. 
We can factor out one of those alphas. 
So, we get alpha times the inner product 
of v with alpha v. 
We factor out the other one, so we get 
alpha times alpha times the inner product 
of v with v. 
And that's just alpha squared times the 
norm squared of v. 
That shows that the third property is 
satisfied. 
And we're going to skip the proof of the 
fourth property. 
Here's an example, we have a two vector, 
u1, u2. 
What's the norm of that vector? 
Well, recall the Pythagorean theorem. 
For a right triangle with sides a, b, and 
c, where c is the length of the 
hypotenuse, a squared plus b squared 
equals c squared. 
We can use this equation to calculate the 
length of this vector u. 
The squared length of u equals the sum of 
the base squared, and the height squared. 
So, at least in the case of two vectors, 
this notion of length agrees with the one 
you're familiar with.
