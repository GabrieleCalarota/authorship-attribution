Now, we've studied matrix-vector 
multiplication, and vector-matrix 
multiplication. 
Now we're going to study matrix-matrix 
multiplication. 
Suppose A is an R by S matrix, and B is 
an S by T matrix. 
Then it's legal to multiply A times B. 
In Mathese, we'd write it as AB and in 
our Mat class, we'll use a star to denote 
multiplication between matrices, so we'd 
write it A star B. 
Now note that A times B is different than 
B times A. 
In fact, one of those products might be 
legal, while the other one is illegal. 
We're going to see two equivalent 
definitions of matrix-matrix 
multiplication. 
One in terms of vector-matrix 
multiplication, and one in terms of 
matrix-vector multiplication. 
We'll start with the definition that uses 
Vector-matrix multiplication. 
Say we're multiplying A and B. 
For each row label r of the matrix A, row 
R of AB is the vector matrix product, the 
row r of A times B. 
So, for example, let's say we're 
multiplying this matrix by B. 
Row 1 of the product is row 1 of the 
first matrix times B. 
Row 2 of the product is row 2 of this 
matrix times B, and row 3 of the product 
is row 3 of this matrix times B. 
How do we interpret this product? 
This is a vector-matrix product, and we 
can use either of our definitions, the 
linear combinations definition or the 
dot-product definition. 
Either one will do. 
So we've defined a matrix product in 
terms of some vector-matrix products. 
How do we interpret this vector-matrix 
product? 
Let's use the linear combinations 
definition, we write B in terms of its 
rows. 
Let's call them b1, b2, and b3. 
Then the matrix-vector product 1, 0, 0 
times the matrix b, by the linear 
combinations definition just picks out 
the first row, b1 of b. 
Similarly, the product of 2,1,0 with a 
matrix b, takes 2 times the first row, 
and 1 times the second, so 2b1 + b2. 
And the product 0,0,1 times the matrix, 
picks out just the third row, b3. 
So in summary, we get this product. 
So what is this doing? 
Multiplying this matrix by this matrix 
really adds twice the first row to the 
second row. 
For that reason we call this an 
elementary row addition matrix. 
Now I'm going to give the matrix-vector 
definition of matrix-matrix 
multiplication. 
For each column label s of B, column s of 
the product AB is A times column s of B. 
So for example, let A be this matrix, and 
let B be the matrix with columns 4, 3, 2, 
1 and 0 minus 1. 
So here's B, those are its columns. 
The products AB is the matrix whose 
column i is the product of A, with column 
i of B. 
So A times the first column 4, 3 is 10 
minus 1, A times the second column, 2, 1 
is 4 minus 1. 
And A times the third columns, 0 minus 1, 
is negative 2, negative 1. 
So the matrix-matrix product Is the 
matrix with those outputs as its columns. 
Now we combine these definitions, the 
definition, the matrix-vector definition 
of matrix-matrix multiplication. 
And the dot-product definition of 
matrix-vector multiplication. 
To get what I call the dot-product 
definition of a matrix-matrix 
multiplication. 
Entry rc of the product AB is the 
dot-product of row r of the first matrix 
with column c of the second matrix. 
For example, to find the matrix-matrix 
product of these two, we think of this 
first matrix as rows. 
We think of the second matrix as columns, 
and we take all of the dot-products, and 
this is the result. 
Now, matrix-matrix multiplication 
interacts in a nice and predictable way 
with transpose. 
But here's the rule. 
The transpose of A times B is B transpose 
times A transpose. 
So for example, here's a product of two 
matrices, call this A and this B, this is 
the product. 
Now, if we take the transposes and 
reverse the order, we get the transpose 
of this is this, the transpose of this is 
this. 
We take the product and we get this 
matrix. 
Now, notice that this matrix is the 
transpose of this. 
Now, you might get confused and think the 
transpose of the product AB is A 
transpose times B transpose, but that's 
the wrong order. 
This is false and in fact it might not 
even make sense. 
It might be that the, that the row and 
column labels make that an illegal 
product. 
For a b to be a legal product, A's column 
labels have to match B's row labels. 
For A transpose to B transpose to be 
legal A transposes column labels, that is A's row labels have to match B 
transposes row labels, that is B's column labels. 
So for example, this product is legal, 
but if you transpose them, you get an 
illegal product. 
Let's see what happens when we multiply a 
matrix by another matrix that happens to 
have a single column. 
Let's call the column B. 
Well, by the matrix-vector definition of 
matrix-matrix multiplication. 
The result is a matrix with a single 
column and that column is the 
matrix-vector product a times B. 
Well this shows that matrix-vector 
multiplication is in some sense subsumed 
by matrix-matrix multiplication. 
If you want to express a matrix-vector 
product, you could always formulate it as 
a matrix-matrix product, where the second 
matrix is actually one column wide. 
Now, there's a convention to interpret a 
vector as one of these one-column wide 
matrix. 
It's called a column vector. 
So we would write the vector 1, 2, 3 in 
this way, as a matrix with one column, 
namely 1, 2, 3. 
And then we'd write the matrix-vector 
product A times the vector 1, 2, 3 as A 
times the column vector that is the 
one-column matrix with 1, 2, 3. 
And generally we would write that as A 
times b without the star in the middle to 
be consistent with our notation For 
matrix-matrix product. 
Now, if we interpret vectors as one 
column matrices, how are we going to get 
vector-matrix product? 
We use the transpose, We can turn a 
column vector into a row vector. 
So, suppose you have the vector b, 1, 2, 
3. 
And you want to take the product of this 
vector with the matrix. 
Consider this vector as a, matri, a row 
matrix, that is, a matrix with only one 
row. 
Then, by the vector-matrix definition of 
matrix-matrix multiplication. 
The product you get is a single-row 
matrix. 
So we would write this as b transpose 
times A, to be consistent with our 
convention of interpreting a vector as a 
column matrix. 
Since the vector b is a column matrix, 
the transpose of b is a row vector. 
That is matrix with a single row. 
Now that we know how to interpret vectors 
as matrices, either column vectors or row 
vectors let's see what it means to 
multiply them. 
There are two ways to multiply vectors 
interpreted as matrices. 
First let's take the product of a row 
vector times a column vector. 
We write that u transpose times v. 
Here's an example. 
Let's take this row vector and multiply 
it by this column vector. 
Now the, the first matrix has one row, 
and the second matrix has one column. 
So, the product matrix has one entry. 
It has one row and one column. 
It's really just a matrix with one number 
in it. 
Now by the dot-product definition of 
matrix-matrix multiplication, that one 
entry is the dot-product of the single 
row of this first matrix. 
With the single column of the second 
matrix. 
So we're really computing a dot-product. 
This is sometimes called the inner 
product, but we're going to use the inner 
product in a more specialized way later 
on. 
Here's another way to multiply vectors 
interpreted as matrices. 
We take a column vector, times a row 
vector. 
Here's an example. 
This column vector times this row vector, 
using the dot-product definition of 
matrix-matrix multiplication. 
The entry in the first row and first 
column of the product is the dot-product 
of the first row of this matrix by the 
first column of this matrix. 
Well that's just the product of this one 
entry, u1, by the one entry, v1. 
Similarly, the ij entry of the product is 
the product of the ith entry of the first 
vector. 
By the jth entry of the second vector. 
This is called an Outer product of two 
vectors.
