Okay now, as you know the, we, we have a
governing equation which is,

can be written like that.
I will introduce three typical solutions.
Okay, one typical solution would represent
the plane wave, one dimensional wave in x
axis.
Right?
So this is the wave propagating in this
direction.
Right going way.
Okay, if it is propagating in, in certain
direction, I mean,
in, in space, at, at, at certain position
r,

Okay.
And then three-dimensional form of wave
can be expressed like that.
Note that I have same omega t, but I have
kr.
What is kr?
k is wave number.
Okay that has, that has three
component, if, if I express it
in, in x and y direction, okay.
So this is wave number vector.
All right?
So, in this case, I have wave propagation
direction in this direction.
So actually, this is the projected wave
number on this surface.
Right.
As I, as I showed here this is,
position vector this is the direction of
wave number.
Okay, if wave is propagating over there,
then the projected wave, the
k dot r is simply how much is projected in
this direction.
So, this is quite general
three-dimensional plane wave.
The reason why we call this plane wave is
simply because, wave front is a plane.
Wave front is plane.
'Kay, wave front is plane.
The k is essentially, the direction normal to
the plane.
All right.
It's very interesting.
And also that this is, because this is
plane wave.
Okay?
If you calculate the velocity uxt using
you know Euler equation then we can obtain
easily,
easily the relation between velocity and
pressure
for plane wave p over u
is z zero that is rho zero c.
So the velocity is simply one over rho zero c
multiplied by pressure.
Okay?
So for the plane wave,
impedance,
that is pressure divided by velocity, so
rho zero c.
And that that is the same as the
characteristic impedance of vdb.
That means there will be no reflection.
So everything is propagating, because the
pressure and the velocity has in phase.
Okay.
Now, what if I have the,
the surface of, of, of propagation, or, or
in
other words, if I have this kind of wave?

That I want to see.
So let's investigate what's going on if I
have the sound pressure look like that.
This is called monopole.
The reason why we call monopole is
because 1 over r
behavior, 1 over r means it has a
singularity at r equal 0.
At r equal 0, the pressure has to go
infinity.
That's why we call these a monopole, which
means that means that we have a one pole,
pole simply means that the, the,
the,
the, the, the, at the pole will have
infinite barrier.
And using Euler equation,
we can find velocity like that.
How to find it?
We take a derivative of pressure with
respect to
r, put the minus, and then we divide, we
divide
this one by rho zero and then we integrate
them with the respect of time, we will get
this.
And the impedance, the reason why we look
at impedance is because impedance exhibits
the,
the characteristics of wave propagation.
Remember, recall
when we have infinite duct that does not
have any
reflection.
What we have?
The impedance was rho zero c.
And the intensity, how does it look like?
Intensity, it fluctuate with, of,
frequency of omega.
But there is, mean intensity.
That has a DC value, right?
But when we have finite dock,
we have a very reactive intensity.
All right?
So, certainly, in this, in this lecture, I
emphasize the intensity
as well as impedance as a major that
exhibits the characteristics of acoustic
wave propagation.

Okay, now we back, we discuss the
extensively about
the meaning of active intensity and the
reactive intensity.
Well, now let's go back to the concept of
impedance,
which again exhibit the characteristic,
one of characteristics of wave
propagation.
And for the monopole case, the impedance
look like that.
Okay, this is the highlight.
It shows that it is a function of kr.
Okay, rho zero c is just the characteristic
impedance of media.
What does it mean?
Okay, if kr is very large, that means kr
is simply 2 pi r
divided by lambda, okay, because k
equals to 2 pi over lambda.
If kr is very large, in other words, the
position I am looking at r is very
long compared with the wavelength.
For instance, when I make a one kilohertz
sound monopole, [NOISE]
the wavelength is about 34 centimeter and
the
wavefront that, I mean, impedance observed
by those guy over there
will be, when kr is very large,
then think kr is very large, this term
goes to 1.
Right?
That means the real part of the impedance
approach to rho zero c.
That means when kr is very large,
impedance approach to
as if the wave front propagate as a plane
wave.
So, in other words, when kr is large,
the wave front propagate as if it is a
plane wave.
What about the imaginary term over here?
When kr is large,
say kr is 100.
The scale of 100 is 10,000.
Ten thousand plus one is 10,001.
One is.
'Is nothing, and I can divide 10,000, I
divide 100 by 10,000 that is 10 to the
minus 2.
That is very small, so that means when
kr is very large, the imagery term is
negligible.
What it means?
That means im-, impe-, the imaginary part
of the impedance imi-, i, is negligible
only at the far field, in other words when
kr is large, the impedance approach to,
the plane wave case.
So that is interesting.
[SOUND].
So lets see in more detail how it behaves.
So, I, I, I normalize
the
impedance with a row zero c which means
that if it approach to 1,
that means it is plane wave, behave as if
as if a plane wave.
Okay.
So this graph is very interesting.
Let me use.
Okay.
About over here, which is the case kr is
more than like a seven or eight.
We can assume this, this area, I mean,
this field is
plane wave.
And we call,

we call this case far field.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Far field.
Far, with respect to wavelengths, okay?
I emphasize again kr is a measure of the
distance with respect to wavelength.
All right, that's interesting.
In the near field, this is, I'll assume
this area is a near field.
Okay.
Near field.
As you can see, this is the, this is the
the function, k r square over 1 plus k r
square.
And this is the function k r over 1 plus k
r square.
That, this is, this represent imaginary
part of the impedance.
As you can see over here, the imaginary
part of,
of, of impedance approach to zero in the
far field.
There is no reactive term in the far
field.
But in, in this field, in this field this
is the close look of the area over here.
And we can see that there is, most likely
there is
equally likely participation of real part
as well as imaginary part.
In other words in the near field,
okay, when you, when you approach to me when
I make one kilohertz sound,
in this field, the impedance has, real
part as well as imaginary part.
Right?
That means you cannot assume the,
the wave proporation over here is plane
wave.
There is, there is almost equally likely
participation of, of,
of, of the equal real part and the
imaginary part.
Okay.
This part shows the pressure and particle
velocity in a near field.
This is magnitude.
And this is a phase.
And this graph shows,
the magnitude of pressure and
phase of pressure.
As you can see here in far field, the
pressure magnitude is almost a constant,
and the phase shows that it propagates as
a spherical wave.
Over here, near field, magnitude depends
on the position.
Okay, phase is quite look, quite different
what we can see in the far field.
Alright, that's interesting.

Okay, this is the case, I mean of dipole.
Okay, dipole, dipole is the
sound wave, when I locate two monopoles very
close, and nearby.
And what will happen?
The typical dipole of sound could be
something generated by
the, the drum, for example, because drum
oscillates like that.
Therefore, there's a sound radiating in,
in, in this two
direction, and, and, and the small
radiation in this direction.
That is dipole.
So, sound directivity of dipole.
Look like, I mean it radiate sound like
that.
Okay.
And looking at the impedance of dipole it
look like that.
That is more complicated but still
the impedance in a far field
of dipole is quite similar with the
monopole, but the reactive part of dipole
decays
slower, I mean, I mean, more slow than,
than the monopole case.
As you can see here, the phase of dipole in
a
far field look like that compared with
the, what previously you saw.
All right.
This is the case of a quadrupole.
Again, far field, very similar behavior.
Okay, I would like to summarize the
chapter Two.
We have attempted to understand how
acoustic waves
are generated and propagated in a
compressible fluid.
By using conservation of mass and the
state equation and the
Newton's second law for unit, unit, surface
and unit volume.
And we found that acoustic intensity
expresses the direction
of acoustic power flow as well as its
magnitude.
And intensity certainly express how the
acoustic energy,

is balanced by intensity flux is through
the surface.
And we studied a way to measure the
acous, associated acoustic variables in
accordance with human perception.
We introduced dB scale and a dBA,
and also we introduce the octave scale.
And then we had a some demonstration, and we
also have the
possible solution, oh, we didn't study
this, possible solution.
Also, we didn't study this.
We will do that later on.
Oh, oh, oh.
And also we studied about monopole,
dipole,
quadropole characteristics of sound.
Okay, that
mostly covers what I intend to talk to you
guys today.
