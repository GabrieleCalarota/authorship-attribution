Okay.
Now, let's move to another case.
The question is, what is going to
happen if we have [SOUND] wave incidence
obliquely to surface of discontinuity.
Okay?
Or if there is a wave obliquely
incident to, for example, partition,
general partition [SOUND].
And what if, the wave incident to, for
example, plate.
That is our next topic of discussion.
To see the fundamental physics associated
with
oblique instance, let's see the following
graph.
Okay, the first question is.
theta i, is incidence angle, and the theta
r, is reflected angle, and theta t, is
transmitted angle.
What is the relation between theta i and
theta r and theta t.
That is governed by very well-known
law, and I'm sure some of you
students, know this.
Surprisingly, when you are in elementary
school.
[LAUGH] There is called the Snell's Law.
[SOUND]
Okay?
Maybe some of the students feel very
guilty that you
do not remember Snell's law, but it
doesn't really matter.
Okay?
Let's see some detailed physics associated
with the Snell's law.
Okay, incident wave
meets flat surface of discontinuity with
this angle,
okay.
Then it propagated this way, therefore,
this is the wavelengths of incident wave.
I mean, suppose it propagated this wave
like that.
And this is the point b, and this is point
a.
Okay, this is propagate, [SOUND].
At certain, at certain time, the incident
wave approach, I mean, reach over
there, a.
Right?
And then it travels.
What the distance?
Read the distance.
This distance.
Okay.
And the reflected wave reflected and
propagated that direction.
Therefore this is, the wavelength due to,
the reflection.
And there is a transmitted wave therefore
this is the wavelength of transmitted
wave.
And the projected distance upon this, 
discontinuity has to be the same.
Right, projected distance of theta t over
there, and the projected distance of this
wavelength
over there, and the projected distance of
this
wavelength over there has to be same,
right?
Geomet, geo, sorry, geometrical identity.
So lets ex, lets express that one,
in terms of,
in terms of the
geometry.
Okay delta Y, delta Y, delta Y, has to be
same.
Lambda i over sine theta.
Well back to here, I can say, delta Y and
this is the angle.
So, what is the relation between lambda t,
lambda t and the delta y.
Lambda t, this is lambda t.
And this is theta t, so therefore,
therefore, this is a theta t.
So therefore, delta Y, sine theta is lambda
T.
Right?
So, this is true.
So, I can say delta y is lambda i over
sine theta i.
And the, this is true and this is true and
this is, snell's law.
And of course this is true too.
Move shows this, and this is not very
interesting,
so let's see what it means by that.
Physically.
Okay?
So let's look at this one, and at that
one.
This
is interesting, because depending on c0
and c1, you
can have interesting phenomena.
Let's see over there.
If I convert this to in a wavenumber
form, and wave number is omega over c0.
So therefore this is, this term is k0 sine
over the 0, and this term is k1 sine
omega.
Or ki sine omega i sine theta i.
So this is simply the projected wave
number on the surface.
Why?
So if k0 is very la- is, is, larger than
ki.
Okay, this is the k0, and I draw the, the,
draw the picture over there.
And a certain angle- [COUGH]
>> This is k0,
sine theta0, so that is the k0.
And sine theta 0 is this length, is that
length.
Has to be equal to k1 sine theta 0.
So, in this case, the k1 sine theta 0 over
there, has to be same as.
Therefore, in this case, theta 1 has to be
90 degree.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So if the angle of incident is, is larger
than
this critical angle, this has to be go
over there.
And it's, it is not possible for k1 sine
theta 1 can be this length.
So geometrically, there is a very
interesting phenomenon happen.
So in this case,
how mathematically we can achieve this
case?
This is the case.
Going over there, this is the case we
should have
some imaginary angle that is, has to be
greater than pi over
two.
This is the case because this I mean K.
K0 sine theta0 is larger than this,
therefore the
angle has to be greater than pi over two,
and that angle
has to be something that represents in
physics that we do not know.
And this angle we call critical angle.
Okay.
And this happens physically for the case
when we have a medium.
K is omega over c, so when c is a small,
that means I am in air.
When c is large,
that means there is water.
Now if some incident angle is greater than,
greater than critical angle, then there is
no transmission
to the wall
Actually what happens is the surface wave
there is a surface wave that is generated.
So if there is a sound wave coming from
water, in this case K0
is larger than k1 in this case.
In any case, there is a transmission.
And let me continue through this rather
strange concept in the next lecture.
And let me summarize what we learned
today.
We reviewed a mass law,
and we, we, we, we studied this mass law
is quite relevant with
the mass law that we observed in single
vibratory system in a high frequency.
So we were sufficiently persuade
that the mass
law is valid only for the high frequency
region.
And the essential element that I
attempted, I have attempted to.
Introduce to you in this lecture, is
transmission coefficient is composed by
two part, one is
fluid loading impedance and, and the other
one is partition impedance.
[COUGH]
The fundamental physical basis
to get that formulation is observing
that Pi plus Pr on the left hand side
of partition is, is equal to, Pt
minus j omega Y, multiplied by Z0.
That, that means that the transmission is,
have,
transmission can be considered as 2 times
the incident pressure.
2, that is blocked pressure, plus the
radiation of partition.
And the radiation of
partition introduced of
fluid loading impedance,
that is [SOUND] that
is written over there.
That's this central part that I attempted
to deliver to you guys.
Today.
And then, we saw that,
the operation learned today can be, seen
as this picture.
[SOUND]
This picture
shows mass low region, and stiffness
controlled region.
And the damping controlled region.
And then we introduces the
interesting physical behavior happen when
we have oblique incident wave.
That's led to what we talk a little bit
more about the physics associated
with oblique distance and I would like to
appreciate you.
The incident angle has to be same as, I
mean reflected angle has to be same as
incident angle,
of course, transmitted angle will be
different.
By seeing those Snell's Law in the wave
number group.
Which is not, I mean, very well known, so
I
personally think that the, looking at
Snell's Law in wave number provides more
physical insight
