We are saying that the three
representative acoustic measure.
One is pressure and the other one is
Density, the other one is velocity
and also we have studied that acoustic
energy is important, variables.
And what other acoustic variables would
be, would be, important?
What, what do you think could be the, next
candidate, that has, that has a
significant meaning?
Other than energy, pressure, velocity, and
density in acoustic.
>> You forgot the intensity.
Oh!
Intensity.
Very happy.
What is intensity?
Okay, what other I mean in mechanical
Engineering, what other significant
you know, you know measure that is, is
similar with intensity. What would be?
And this is power per unit area, right?
Because pressure is force per unit area,
so intensity is nothing but power
per unit area.
That's great, that's great.
So let's see what's the relation between
intensity, and other acoustic variables.
Again
Let's consider one dimensional case.
Okay, I have
volume
that has delta x multiplied by S
Okay,
if there is some power into this volume,
through this surface.
That would be p, multiplied by u,
multiplied by S.
That is power.
As you said force times velocity.
p multiply S is force.
Then what about the power coming out, 
from
this volume through this surface x plus delta x?
That should be using Taylor expansion, I
can write that would
be p u s plus  d p u s, dx.
Okay?
So if I have more, power out through this
surface, then I will have a decrease of
energy
inside of volume so I can write.
The energy balance,
through this surface and this value.
I can write energy balance like that.
Increase of energy
inside of this
volume has to be
balanced by
the power in through
surface of this.
And the power out through, the
surface of this: x plus delta x.
Okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay?
If I put minus, then, that means the power in,
through the surface of this, minus power
out, through the surface that.
If it is positive,
If it is a positive, then increase of
energy has to be positive.
Right?
Okay, and let's think that this is a bank
account.
[LAUGH]
The money coming in per day
Iis $10 million, and the money, coming out
per day
is $9 million, that increase of a money in
the bank would be
$1 million that has to be positive as I
said before.
So, rearrange what I said over there.
conceptually by using some mathematical
form, then I can write de dt
that's the energy inside of this volume.
Therefore I write delta x and s,
thus the total energy inside
of this volume, that has to be
balanced by this that is rho u s
and then minus rho u s minus dp,
sorry, not rho, p, sorry.
All right.
Oh.
p u s and a p u s minus d p u s, dx, that is, huh?
Delta x, okay,
ds. So what we have now is.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
rate of increase of energy per unit volume,
that is de dt.
This will go away and the dx, dx, s, s, 
so I
have, minus d p u dx.
Note that.
This is change with respect of space and
this is change with respect of time.
Physically means that, the net, net
intensity flux has to be balanced to be by
rate of increase of energy inside, on the,
in, in the unit volume.
So expanding this to 3D, I can write this
is de dt,
that has to be balanced by intensity flux.
Why?
For y component I have d p v dy with 
z component, I might have d p w dk dz.
Okay.
We can, we can easily expand.
What you obtained over here to y and x
case.
And this expresses what we just argued.
So,
make a box over here.
And.
I erase so, another one is energy has
potential and
kinetic and potential energies one half p
square over rho zero
c square and kinetic energy is one half
rho zero u square.
Okay, now.
Suppose I have mean velocity.
Okay, you have a wind is, is blowing in
this direction.
Can we use this formulation.
Do you think we can use this form, for the
case when we have wind?
Okay, wind is blowing and, and I am
whistling over there.
Can you use this formulation?
What I'm saying is that if I've measured
the velocity of wind,
that is u zero, then I plus u zero plus u 
over there.
Can I use the kinetic energy, which has to
be one half rho zero u zero plus u square.
They think that is correct?
And remember, the assumption we made, when
we get this famous p, rho, u, relation.
We assume that the fluid is quasient.
In other words, there is no convection.
So we can now use this term.
u zero plus u.
So everything we got over here, is valid,
under the several assumptions.
That's what I want to emphasize.
The first assumption,
Quasiennt fluid.
In other words there is no mean flow, no
convection.
Second,
p that is access pressure, and velocity
and rho prime
is very small enough to be linearized.
Okay?
Under this assumption, what we obtain is
valid.
Okay?
So now let's move on.
To enjoy or, have a further insight about
what we have.
What if I have a plane wave.
[SOUND]
What if I have plane wave.
Okay.
Well, plane wave, for plane wave 
pressure over velocity,
has to be equal to z zero, that is
characteristic impedance of medium.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Right?
We saw it.
Therefore, in this case, I can write p is
equal to rho zero, c u.
Then, the potential energy,
which is one half p square over row zero c
square
is equal to one half I plot this one over
there then I have rho zero c square
u square rho zero c square, therefore I got
one half
rho zero u square.
That is the same as, kinetic energy.
So, for plane wave, kinetic energy and
potential energy,
equally likely participate in acoustic
wave.
That is interesting.
That is interesting.
But what about for the wave that is not
plain?
Obviously, we can say that potential
energy
and the kinetic energy would be different.
