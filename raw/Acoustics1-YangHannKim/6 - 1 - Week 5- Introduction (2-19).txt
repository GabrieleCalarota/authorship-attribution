In the last lecture we studied when some
sound is coming into this obstacle, in
normal direction.
For example when I whistle a one kilohertz
sound again.
[WHISTLE].
Then, as you study, this wall or partition
will vibrate like this.
And some wave will be reflected, and some
wave be,
will be transmitted due to the vibration
of this wall.
But what if I, we have some sound coming
to this flat surface of
discontinuity, but not normal direction,
while having some oblique incidence?
.
For example, when I whistle like this
[SOUND], then obviously the sound will
propagate into this direction.
Therefore the transmission would be
different
compared with what we studied already.
But thinking about this, this kind of, 
oblique incidence,
then we can decompose this oblique
incidence will be
decompose into normal incidence as, and,
and the other
one is very tangential, this flat surface
of discontinuity.
Okay?
So, in this lecture we will study how this
obliqueness
will affect the transmission of flat
surface of discontinuity.
The second topic is rather complicated,
compared with what we, studied.
That is the case if this partition vibrate
like this, like a plate, okay.
And I, and we have sound incident to this
plate like this.
[SOUND]
Then how does the property of a plate
really affect the transformation?
That is the what we are going to study, in
this lecture.
