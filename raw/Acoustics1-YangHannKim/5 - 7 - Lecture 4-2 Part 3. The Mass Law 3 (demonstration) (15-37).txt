If two media are same, then Z1 equal to
Z0, then I
got RTL, transmission loss, that is 10 log
10.
And I have omega m square
plus 4 Z0 square divide
by 4 Z0 square.
Then I have this is equal to one, 10 log
10,.
I have one plus omega m 2 Z0 square.
That's what we obtain.
Mistake?
Huh, huh?
Huh?

>> Z0?

Okay.
[SOUND].

This is interesting formula.
If this one is very large compared with
one.
And this is the case.
For example, m for you know, plywood per
unit.
Mass, one meter and one meter.
That will be, how much?
Guess!
Maybe two kilo or three kilo, and omega,
that is two pi f.
If you are considered one kilohertz, that
will be 6,000 multiplied by 2 or 3.
That is huge.
And what is Z0 for air?
That is above 415.
So that is about, 1,000, right?
So this will be normally much, much larger
than one.
Therefore, I can neglect this.
Therefore I can apProximate that this 20
log 10 
2 pi f m over 2Z0.
Okay that is interesting formula.
And I this is 2 and 2 and a pi Z0.
Z0 for error is about 415 and pi is about
6.
So I can come up with some interesting
formula which has very practical value.
Okay.
And also we can easily find
the one, this value pi
f m over Z0 equal to 1.
Which is the case when this one
has 0 transmission loss.
Okay?
So that I call blocked pressure, blocked
frequency, fb.
And block to frequency is simply because
when this is 1 that is blocked
frequency, then fb is equal to Z0
over pi multiply m.
Okay.
This blocked frequency concept is very
useful
because,
because because I found the blocked
frequency.
And then if I increased the frequency
twice.
According to this formula, according to
this formula.
If I increase the frequency twice,
I will get a transmission loss 6 dB
increase, right?
Everybody understand?
If I increase f to 2f, 2f then this will,
has to be multiplied by 2 and a 20 log 10
to the 2 is a 6 dB.
So when I increase the frequency twice,
our increase transmission loss, 6
dB and then if I increase more twice, then
6 dB more.
So what I can do is.
I just count.
For example, if blocked frequency by using
some plywood air.
If I find blocked frequency is 50 hertz.
Okay?
Then I increase the frequency or mass per
unit area twice.
Then I increase 6 dB, okay?
So, what did I say?
Blocked frequency of 50 hertz, right?
Then, increase twice, frequency then I go
to 100.
Increases twice the frequency I would go
to 200.
Increases twice the frequency I would go
to 400.
Increase the frequency twice I would go to
800.
What if I have a noise at 800 100 dB,
then using the, the, the material I
use, I can reduce the, the, the
noise by 6 multiply 5 that is 30 dB.
So you can, you can design the wall by
just calculating this frequency.
And using your thumb, you can, you can
talk to your supervisor using
the, the material of available I can
reduce the, reduce the noise.
For example, 30 dB.
That makes you look like an expert in
noise control.
Okay, let's see some more details using the
PowerPoint.
Okay before, before I show you,
showing the details I will, show
you whether this going to be
true or not by, demonstrating, our
example.
[SOUND]
This is about.
[SOUND]
About 72 and I close
and this go to
about 40 or 50 dB.
Then I will, this is 2T so I increased
the mass twice and I should get down 6dB
has to be about 45 or 50.
So I, it has to be decreased.
[SOUND]
This is about 40 dB.
So it follow
Mass Law.
Okay, our increase 4T.
That has to go below
40 dB and you will
see 34, 34.
So 34, 40, 46.
[SOUND]
So that's good.
That's good.
And the thickness of this wall is
very small compared with the wave length
lambda.
Right?
So this theory works.
[SOUND] And
the best way to reduce this noise is to
turn off source, of course.
And you, you have a, you have a perfect
design [LAUGH].
All right, so this is what we have.
A good demonstration.
So you have to believe what we obtained
over here.
Practically valuable, it's practically
valuable.
This is called Mass Law.
This is a famous Mass Law in acoustics.
What it essentially says, by increasing
frequency or mass
twice, transmission loss will increase 6
dB.
That is the Mass Law.
And, and most of the noise control
engineering
for reducing sound using, you know, wall
or whatever.
They usually use Mass Law.
This is the major concept.
So if you understand Mass Law, you can
behave
as if you are very well-trained noise
control engineer.
And now, I will give you some interesting
number so that you
can really behave as if you are very well
trained noise control engineer.
Okay, omega is 2 pi.
No, no, omega 2 pi f.
And 2 pi divided by 2 Z0.
Okay, and I said, if you want,
if you know this, the, the
blocked frequency which make the
frequency that is equal to 1.
Then,
okay, like over there, I can use pen
over here.
And this is blocked frequency.
And this is about 132 divided by mass per
unit area.
So 132 that's easy to remember if you
don't, if, if you don't
want to remember this strange number, you
can just remember 131.
Because that look like a wall, right?
Wall.
Okay.
[LAUGH]
Wall.
So, 131 is okay.
Now if you remember this blocked
frequency, what it can do is this.
This is blocked frequency and this is the
line that expresses
the exact RTL mass Law.
That is 10 log 10, and you have one plus
omega m 2Z0 square.
And that this is the, the, the curve.
But in, in a high frequency range, in a
high frequency range over this range.
The ma, the, the transmission loss follows
the Mass Law.
Okay therefore if I know the block
frequency,
that is, for the 132 divide by m, okay.
And if you know the, the, the for example
gypsum, if you use a gypsum or
gypsum for blocking noise in, in, in, in a
factory, for example.
Or suppose you are, you so, you want to
block the noise coming from your
neighborhood, in your in, in, in, in your
dormitory.
Okay.
That will be more sensible.
And if you find some good gypsum, and
suppose the mass of
gypsum is, for convenience, is one kilo
per unit scale.
Then your blocked frequency is 132.
Then this curve says
at 264 hertz, you will get 6 dB
down, 6 dB noise down coming from your
neighborhood.
And twice the frequency you will have one
more 6 dB down.
So you will have 12 dB down.
If you double your gypsum then you will
have additional 6 dB down.
Right.
So that's very easy wave to design your
your noise
control wall that reduce noise coming from
your neighborhood.
So Mass Law is the highlight of today's
lecture, 6 dB down, by doubling frequency
or mass.
Okay?
That expresses everything you learned
today.
Okay?
And, and we will talk more about more
complicated
case, but it's just the correction of Mass
Law.
So central concept, what is associated
with
the flat surface of discontinuity is Mass
Law.
Thank you very much.
