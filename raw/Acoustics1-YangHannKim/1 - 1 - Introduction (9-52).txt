Welcome to our course Introduction to
Acoustics.
We will essentially talk about how the
sound is generated,
so generation of sound, and then generated
sound will propagate.
So propagation, that's what we have to
understand.
And then we will hear the sound or we
could say reception of a sound, hearing.
So in this course what we are going to
explain to you is first
how sound is generated like this how the
sound is
generated or [SOUND] how sound is
generated.
And then how this generated sound is
propagating into
medium and how the generated the sound
propagated and then how we receive or how
we hear the sound.
Okay.
So in the first chapter we will talk about
the relation between vibration and waves.
Okay, vibration is something oscillating
with
a certain period of time, like this.
So as you can see here when I oscillate
this more rapidly then the frequency will,
will increase.
That’s very typical measure of time
fluctuation and vibration.
But if you have a string like this and if
I oscillated this, this string over here
with a certain, with a certain
frequency say frequency f then the wave
will be generated and then propagating
into this direction.
Okay?
What if I have some boundary over here, in
other words, this string is connected to
rigid wall.
Then the propagated sound will be
reflected.
Therefore the different with a vibration
vibration.
In this case the waves will be propagating
into a string.
That is typical one dimensional wave
propagation problem.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
Propagation.
Okay, the reason why we attempt to use
this rather simple one
dimensional case is because one
dimensional case is a simple.
Therefore is easier to understand and then
we will keep using this one dimensional
case to explain other physical phenomena
related
with sound generation, propagation, and the
reception.
Okay, and then we will move to the second
chapter.
That has to do with acoustic wave
equation.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
Acoustic wave equation.
The reason why we are, we are going to
study acoustic wave equation is
because acoustic wave, wave equation
governs everything
related with sound generation, propagation
and reception.
But I mean, as you can feel, if you hear
about
acoustic wave equation, it looks very
complicated and difficult to understand.
Therefore we will use again.
Similarly as we used for explaining
vibration and
waves we will use a simple one dimensional
case.
Say there is a duct.
Okay?
And I generate a wave, acoustic wave over,
over here like.
[SOUND].
Then wave is propagating compared with
this case
the waves inside of duct is longitudinal
wave.
This case is transverse wave because the
medium, the, the, the string element
will oscillate in this direction, but wave
propagate in this direction.
But this case fluid oscillate in this
direction and wave propagate in this
direction therefore we call this
longitudinal
wave and we call this transverse wave.
So this example very analogous with what
we are going to study over here.
So, again, if I have rigid wall over here,
wave is propagating
in this direction, and then, and then
reflected back, and
what we'll observe in this case would be
very similar with
what we started in one dimensional
vibration and waves case.
And then we will introduce the fundamental
physical measures.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
That represents, again, generation,
propagation and reception of sound.
What would be the fundamental and physical
measures that represents the acoustic wave
propagation.
First sound pressure that will be depends
on space and time.
And then because we are handling the
medium which is compressible as we can
anticipate it using this rather simple
case the fluid particle will be.
The fluid will be compressed and released
by exciting the certain
if I exciting over here so the fluid, if a
fluid
part, fluid is compressed and released
there will be some density change.
And if there is a density change and there
is a pressure change then fluid particle
will also change.
So essentially we will talk about the
relation between acoustic pressure and the
density and the velocity, the relation
come out with the acoustic wave equation.
Of course in this chapter we will talk
about how to solve typical acoustic wave
equation.
And then we will also talk about the
fundamental measure that
has to do with the acoustic pressure and
density and velocity.
Especially we will talk about how to
measure and
what would be the appropriate fundamental
measure of acoustic pressure.
Normally we will, I mean it will be
decibel scale and how we
hear in frequency scale we will introduce
octave one third octave et cetera.
And then we will move to third chapter
that hand, handles,
with the waves on flat surface of
discontinuity.
[NOISE].
We already learn how the
wave will be reflected when we have
the rigid wall for the one dimensional
case, but we'll expand the
concept to two dimensional case.
Of course, we will start with the one
dimensional case, over here
too, and then we have a wall that has a
certain mass.
Then because of the presence of a wall
some
wave will be reflected and some wave will
be transmitted.
We would like to know how much wave will
be transmitted or reflected compared with
the incident wave.
Of course it depends on the condition of
the flat surface.
Okay this flat surface could be could have
some spring and dashpot,
or the flat surface has a behave as if it
is plate, things like that.
We will handle this problem at chapter 3.
Okay chapter 1, 2, 3 will make part one.
Therefore part one essentially handles
very basic concept that has to do with one
dimensional acoustic wave propagation,
generation propagation and reception.
And we will at part one we will talk about
fundamental acoustic wave equation
and dacibel scale that measures sound
pressure and you know octave scale.
All that has to do with a frequency scale.
