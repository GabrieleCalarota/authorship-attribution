We learn about the decibel scale in the
last lecture
and decibel scale is defined as
10 log 10.
Average,
mean square average.
Meaning that I'm averaging of square of the
pressure.
With respect to the square of reference
pressure, and there here the reference
pressure is simply 20 micropascal.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
What it means.
That is the smallest acoustic pressure
that very healthy young people can hear.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
The reason why we are using decibel scale,
I explained the last lecture.
One reason is, we are hearing very small
sound pressure up to very large sound
pressure.
Okay?
Text explain how we hear.
And this one is very interesting.
Our cochlear,
[BLANK_AUDIO]
has very interesting characteristics.
As you can see over here
very high frequency sound arrives on up to
here.
A very low frequency arrives on up to there.
So, the cochlea
is sort of, spectrum analyzer in other
words, because if
you have hairs that are damaged over here,
then you will not hear high frequency.
If you have a hair cell damaged over there
you will not hear the low frequency.
So these cochlea or these distribution of
cochlea, because there is a hair cell
along this
cochlea.
There is, there is a membrane, and
there is a cochlea.
And if there is a some sound, then the
cochlea will respond.
And the hair cell respond.
The hair cell's action.
Produces some, some, some electric voltage
difference and that is transmitted through
to the brain and brain understand, oh,
there is a 3,000 hertz sound.
Okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And also this very interesting, our
hearing
system sense the frequency not in linear
scale.
So when I whistle 1 kilohertz.
[SOUND] And when, when I hear some 2
kilohertz [SOUND].
Our hearing system would think that, oh,
there is, I mean, 2 kilohertz
and 1 kilohertz is a 2, I mean, 2
kilohertz are twice of a 1 kilohertz.
I cannot produce a 4 kilohertz.
[SOUND] It is beyond this frequency.
There our hearing systems just think that
oh, that is twice of the 2 kilohertz.
In other words, as we saw before, decibel
scale, we sense
the pressure, we sense the pressure with
respect to this.
And also, we sense the acoustic, acoustic
frequency with respect to something that
we call one is octave scale.
Octave scale which meaning simply that
there is frequency F1 and
frequency F2 is simply twice of the base
frequency.
And 1 3rd octave scale meaning that the F2
is 2 to the 1 3rd of the base frequency.
The reason why we are using this frequency
scale is simply because.
Our hearing system is sensing the
frequency with respect to f1.
Base frequency.
So this is octave scale.
This is 1 3rd octave scale, general octave
scale,
1 n-th octave scale can be written like
that.
Okay?
So, if you see the, the frequency
difference
of octave scale, that is simply 70% of the
base frequency.
Okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO].
And, 1 3rd octave scale frequency band is
about 23%
of the, of the, sorry, center frequency
F0.
So if you have a narrow, narrow octave
scale then your bandwidth of the, of
your scale, become narrow, narrow, narrow.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
Therefore, there is, it is necessary to
define
all this base frequency or the center
frequency.
Because if everybody use different center
frequency, we.
Would have some confusion.
So, the, there is a some standard.
So this is octave center frequency,
starting with a 31.5.
Next octave scale is simply twice of this
octave scale, that's 63, and then
125, 125, 500, 1 kilo, 2 kilo, 4 kilo, 8
kilo, 16 kilohertz.
That is the standard octave scale.
Center frequency of octave scale.
As I said before, the bandwidth of this
octave scale is 70% of each center
frequency.
The reason why we are using this
very strange octave center frequency, is
because.
What? Our hearing system.
So we had to accept it.
Mm-hm.
And this is 1 3rd octave band scale
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And the SPL is divide like that.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay.
This graph shows.
31.5, 63, 125, 250, 500, 1
kilohertz, 2 kilohertz, 4 kilohertz, 16
kilohertz.
This graph
is very interesting graph.
Okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO].
Okay, 1 kilohertz if you go over there
this is 10.
What it means by 10?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
10 decibel.
So I am sensing.
10 decibel at 1 kilohertz over here.
But, but at 250 to sense
the 10 decibel I need some
pressure more than 10 decibel.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
In other words, this is 10 decibel.
Add a 10 decibel, okay?
1 kilohertz, and 1 kilohertz when I says
10 decibel,.
And either sound pressure 10 decibel.
But our hearing system,
our hearing system, sensation of our
hearing system depends on frequency.
So let me demonstrate.
[SOUND] This is 1 kilohertz.
I increase.
[SOUND]
Okay, I am increasing the, the 10 decibel.
I mean, the, the frequency of 1 kilohertz.
What you hear is what you, what you sense
along this line.
Okay.
But over hearing system is not sensitive
as, it, as we hear at 1 kilohertz.
A low frequency.
Use your, your, your cochlea system, your
hearing system is not sensitive
as you as you sensitive at 1 kilohertz.
So to get a 10 decibel at a frequency at
the 63 hertz you need.
40 decibel.
Okay.
40 decibel at the 63 hertz owed excite
your hearing system as if that you are
excited at 1 kilohertz 10 decibel.
Okay.
So this called, equal loudness contour.
In other words, how you feel the same
loudness with respect to frequency.
Equal loudness contour.
This whole, this whole graph
is
to emphasize that our hearing system
depends on frequency, alright.
And it is interesting that 2 kilohertz and
1 kilohertz,
we have, almost the same loud, equal
loudness contour.
In other words, 2 kilohertz and 1
kilohertz is most of sensitive frequency
band.
Why?
Ask your god.
Simply our hearing system behaves like
that.
At high frequency over there equal
loudness curve rising
therefore 1 kilohertz and 2 kilohertz we
have equal loudness going.
High frequency and low frequency, our
sensitivity of hearing system is changing.
So for example, at 8 kilohertz,
you need more than 10 decibel.
To have the same loudness.
In other words simply say, beyond of the 1
kilohertz and 2 kilohertz, our sensory
system is not sensitive as we sense the
sound at 1 kilohertz and 2 kilohertz.
So for noise control issues, if
you have a low frequency over there, you
don't
have to put the same effort as you put
the, in the frequency range 1 kilohertz, 2
kilohertz.
That's why we need some sort of weighting.
A weighting, B weighting, C weighting.
So, not only just the dB scale.
We need dB A, or dB C, or dB B.
Mostly using scale is dB A scale.
As you can see, over here, this is in 1
kilohertz and 2 kilohertz.
We have zero weighting but at low
frequency, we have big weighting and high
frequency.
We have big weighting.
For noise control purpose therefore we
have to use
at least the dB(A) scale not just the dB
scale,
because noise control with respect to
human being.
We have to consider our sensory system.
We're weighting.
So we need a dB A.
Okay?
So, today, we talked about mainly intensity.
And also, we talked about the octave
scale, as well as the dB scale.
And did we mention about, equal loudness contour, contour.
And, which provide us to use our weighting
system, A weighting,
mostly.
