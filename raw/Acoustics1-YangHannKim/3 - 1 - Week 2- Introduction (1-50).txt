In the second week we will essentially
talk about the relation between three
fundamental and representative
physical measures which are
pressure, density, and velocity of 
sound.
The velocity of sound what I'm saying
would be the particle velocity of
compressed air.
For example, when I excite this bottle by
blowing it,
[SOUND]
you will hear sound because sound is
generated over here and then propagated
and they reach to your ear.
If you think this kind of, in this
kind of demonstration carefully, then what
we can easily observe is that, because of
the excitation, the sound,
the, the air inside of this bottle will be
compressed and released.
Therefore there will be some density
change.
Obviously we can see that the pressure
change is related with the density change.
And, and also we can anticipate there will
be some particle movement in this neck.
So, we can conclude that studying these
three different
parameters, representative parameters,
sound pressure,
particle velocity of air, or water,
compressed fluid
and the density will construct the
fundamental governing
equation, which means that the equation
that governs
everything associated with acoustic wave
phenomena.
