Suppose I have sinusoidal wave.
And then, if I move this particle.
Up and down, I mean down and up.
When I move this particle over here.
The wave look like that, and then move
back the wave like this
or upward, look like that and then down
look like this.
So this is one period.
Right?
This is one period.
I move down, up and down.
And then use as you can see here, the way
the lengths of wave propagate,
the distance of wave propagate is a one
wavelength, as you can see over here.
And that is what I explain.
Alright.
So move down,
move down and go up, up and down.
Then one period of time, the wave is
propagating in one length, one wavelength.
That's what I explained using this,
powerpoint, I mean, this equation.
Suppose, now we have two waves.
So one is, right going wave, and the other
is a left going wave.
And I, I, I argue that.
This is complete description of one
dimensional wave.
Okay?
Let's look at some detail of this wave.
How to look at the details of this wave?
Using differentiation.
If you, if you want the details of
physics, we normally use differentiation.
So, let's take a derivative of this wave
with respect to x.
And then later on, we will look at the
change of this wave with a respect to
time.
Okay, taking the derivative with a respect
to x over g, is
simply g prime, and prime means I am
taking the derivative.
With respect to x or x minus ct, there's same
.
And h take the derivative with respect to
h is h prime.
And what about the taking the derivative
of this wave with respect to time.
And that is minus cg prime because there
is a minus c over there.
Okay?
And taking the derivative of each
function with
respected to time provided also c and h
prime.
Okay, this is interesting.
If I take a derivative again with respect
to x on this
the htybf what I will get is a g double
prime and h double prime.
And then if I take a derivative with
respect
to time on g prime and this one and this
one, what I will get is a c squared
g double prime and a c squared h double
prime.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Is it big deal?
Yes, it is a big deal.
That means, that means g double-prime, I
mean, the, the rate of
change of wave with respect to x and the
with respect of time is related again.
Okay.
Let's see.
We, we let's see some more details.
In a dgdadt as written over here look like
that.
And if you take more derivatives,
then we can conclude that the right going
wave.
With respect to time is related with,
with, with respect to
space like that, and the left going wave
also related like that.
Therefore total wave y is related with
space and time is related like this.
And this is wave equation.
Very well known, the wave equation.
So
in other words, the wave
yxt, that has a right going wave and a
left going wave
is the solution of the wave equation.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
This is, what I want to say, to the
students today.
So, the y, the, the left going wave and
right
going wave, is the result, of our thinking.
I mean, what I mean by our thinking is
we, we, we postulate all possible waves in
one dimension.
Of course, one dimension, there is one
possible wave is this wave
and one possible wave is this wave and we
express those waves.
In functional form that is gx minus ct and
h
X plus ct, and by using the
mathematical operator we found that those
ways of follow the wave equation.
Okay.
In other words this wave equation,
this wave equation describes the wave we
just talked about, yxt.
So mathematically speaking.
What we are going to do is we solved this
wave
equation, that is gx minus ct and hx plus
ct.
And
the type of solution depends on the boundary
conditions.
So this is a wave equation, plus boundary
condition.
We'll determine the possible waves in one
dimension.
So mathematically speaking, we are solving
wave
equation provided that some
boundary condition.
And that is not very intruding to all of
you students, that is too mathematical.
So, generally I can say there is a wave
equation.
Okay.
And if there is a boundary condition,
general boundary condition then I, we, we,
we
are supposed to solve the wave sign that
satisfy wave equation as well as boundary.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay.
That is not very exciting, so let's move
on to another very, interesting case.
Okay, there are, typical boundary
conditions, like this.
And this is rigid end boundary condition
and, general
spring mass boundary condition or, if I
oscillate the string.
With this amplitude, this is a forced
boundary condition.
Or, what I call this is passive
boundary condition, and this active
boundary condition.
Depending on type of boundary condition,
the wave,
that satisfy, the wave equation would be
different.
Okay.
Lets move on to the interesting case.
Okay?
Suppose we have a two medium, one is a
rather thin string and the other one is a
thick string.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
There's a wave, and if this wave meets
some discrepancy over here, the
only thing that's allowed to be happen is
the reflection and transmission.
No other you know physical phenomenon is
likely possible.
So wave is propagating this direction, and
then it meets some
discontinuity and it has to be reflected
or transmitted.
How much is reflected and transmitted?
Okay let's see.
How this physical simple physics can be
explained?
Okay, in this medium.
I call medium one, and the possible wave
at this
medium one or the right going wave, and
left
going wave, and left going wave, I denote
h1
t plus x over c1.
And right going wave is a g1 t minus x
over c1.
So this is complete expression that
describe all possible
waves that can be exist, existed in this
medium.
And in this medium, there would be only.
Right going wave,
so I will denote that as g2 because g
stands
for right going wave, h stands for left
going wave.
And this can be written as like tx over
c2.
C2 is the speed of propagation.
At this string number two.
And c1 is the speed of propagation in
string number one.
Our objective, immediate objective, is to
find out how much
transmitted h1, and how much, sorry.
How much reflected h1.
And how much transmitted, g2.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay.
The
amount of reflection and transmission,
will be
decided by the condition of discontinuity,
right?
There is nothing, nothing else other than
condition of discontinuity.
Okay.
Depending on the condition of
discontinuity, h,
amount of h1 and g2 will be decided.
What would be the condition of
discontinuity?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
One is, as I said before, the two
different
type of boundary condition, I, I, I
already mentioned.
One is, passive boundary condition.
And the other one is active boundary
condition.
In others words at a discontinuity the
velocity has to be continuous.
Otherwise two extreme will break down, and
also, the force acting in this structure
has to be same.
[SOUND]
Because there at the discontinuity there
is no mass.
String one and string two have a
discontinuity, there is no mass.
Therefore the force in medium one, string
one and string two has to be same.
So, I have two boundary conditions.
That means I have two equations.
And here, I have h1 and g2 is two
unknowns provided that g1 is given.
Then I can solve it.
And we do know, these two waves satisfy
the wave equation.
We don't have to worry about it.
And our objective is to find out, h1 and
g2 compare with g1.
In other words, how much wave is reflected
with the respect to
g1, how much wave is transmitted with the
respect to g1?
That we call reflection coefficient and
the transmission
coefficient, and those are reflected
reflection
coefficient and transmission coefficient
also depends on the
characteristics of this medium, that is
string number one.
And the characteristics of this medium
that is string number two, and this is
very vital, important approach
that allows us to understand transmission
and reflection.
Let's see how to do it.
Okay.
As I mentioned before, the
velocity of a string at x equal 0 minus, 0
minus
means that I use the coordinate x equal
zero over here.
Zero minus is just before, x equal 0.
That means it's string number one.
The string, velocity the string number one
and velocity
of the string number two has to be same.
And, the force at.
String number one plus the force as string
number two will act to the mass between
string number one and string number two,
that is zero because there is no mass.
Now stamps according to the Newton's
second law that
has, that is a resultant force acting.
Are 0 mass coming between medium one and
medium two.
Or, if you like, string number one, and
string number two is to be 0.
This
is a boundary condition, and we have a
solution; therefore, we can solve it.
Okay.
If you see my book, then you will found
out how to solve it and lets
see a result, is very simple.
H1 is the amount of,
amount of waves reflected.
And g2 is amount of
wave transmitted.
And the g1 is incident wave.
The amount of reflected wave compare with
the incident wave is totally depends on
this strange, strange letter z.
And the z is the characteristic impedance
of a string.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Which I did not explain in detail, okay.
Characteristic impedance of a string.
Is related with density of a string per
unit length
rho L and properation speed in medium one
rho LC.
Thus is very interesting, if two string
are
same that means z1 is equal to z2, then
this
is 0, therefore there is no reflected wave.
Okay.
If z2 is very small compared with z1,
for example, z1 is a 1 billion and z2 is a
10 then this is 1.
In this case, h1 over
g1 is 1.
That means total reflection.
Right?
What about this case?
This is, expresses how much wave is
transmitted.
When z1,
is very small compared to z2, and this is
0.
There will be no, transmission.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
If z1 is very large, compared with a z2.
Then there is,
did I say z1 is very large, right?
In this case g2 is twice of g1,
that is not possible anyway.
Because, I mean transmitted wave is a
twice bigger than, incident wave.
And you have to very careful about this.
This is only talking about the amplitude
of the transmission.
Okay.
But, the energy and power of transmission
has to
be the velocity of vdg2 and the velocity
of g1.
If you calculate the velocity of g2 and
the velocity of g1.
Then this would be 2 z2 01 plus z2
therefore actually when z1 is much,
much larger than z2 the amount of energy
transmitted to the medium two is
negligible.
Okay, anyway, I will go some details in
the next lecture.
Today's lecture, let's see the generally
what's going to happen.
By this, using this graph.
Okay, when z1 is the same as z, z1.
Over z2 is a 0 what,
oh, oh, oh, oh, what's the physical,
physical situation of this?
The rigid wall condition, right?
There is this string and there is a rigid
wall.
And then z2 is, is very large, then
our physics says there will be a total
reflection.
So wave, instant wave, reflected, no
transmission.
Increasing
reflection.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Some small transmission, but increasing z1
over z2.
Transmission is increasing.
When z1 equal z2, that means string one
and string two is identical.
There will be total transmission, no
reflection when z1 over z2 increase.
There is a reflection as well as a
transmission, but
interestingly the phase of this wave and
of this wave.
Is the reverse,
right.
Looking over there when z1 over z2 is
getting large and large.
It's a very interesting phenomenon occurs.
So that means depending on the, the ratio
between z1 and z2.
In other words, characteristic impedance
of a string.
The, how the, the amount of reflected wave
and transmit wave.
It's determined and also the phase is
changing,
right as you can see over here.
So in this lecture, what, what I, I, I'm
emphasizing that.
The characteristic impedance of a string
determines all
the reflected and transmitted
characteristics of a wave.
And I didnât talk about what is precisely
the characteristic impedance of a string yet.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And our talk about a character, what is
the
characteristic impedance of a string in
the next lecture?
So let me summarize today's lecture, okay,
let me summarize today's lecture.
First.
What I, what I emphasized is oscillation
in time, produce oscillation in space.
In other words, oscillation in time is not
independent with oscillation in space
and dispersion relation relate.
How the oscillation in time, is related
with oscillation is space.
That is simply this, k equal to omega over
c.
This is what you have to remember in this
lecture.
Okay?
And the other one, I
introduced today is the amount
of reflected wave and amount of
transmitted wave, right?
It's completely controlled by
characteristic impedance
of a string, z1 and z2.
Okay.
We will talk about the details of those
characteristic impedance, next lecture.
