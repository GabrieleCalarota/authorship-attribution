Lets look at this graph, this famous
graph, okay.
This is zero decibel
and this is a 60 decibel, that corresponds
to normal, you know,
the sound pressure level and, and, and,and
walking area, okay?
If you have a very loud sound like a jet
noise that will be
between 100 dB or 130 dB,140 dB if you
want to get,
then in linear scale the p square average
should be ten to the 14th, right?
That is very big sound.
I don't know whether you guys really have
a chance to listen to jet noise.
But I'm sure you have chance to hear the
very
loud Rock and Roll music for example.
Okay?
That corresponds to about between 110 and
120 dB.
Okay, lowing down over here, when you
discuss
together, okay, very anticipated
discussion.
Everybody, everybody wants to talk and
with passion and
energy, okay, that corresponds to about 
70dB.
If you go to the library, quiet,
in the library which is used by so
called civilized students,
okay, the sound pressure
level of that library is between
30-40 dB, okay.
For example, if you if you go to a very
expensive
restaurant, which requires your dress
code,
very calm, which will be about 30 dB.
So, now you have the feeling about decibel
scale.
So you, you now, you now have an idea, a
very rough idea
about the decibel scale, right?
So let's move to another one.
Okay, this demonstrate how you
feel about different decibel scales.
6 dB 3 dB and 1 dB.
Okay, 3 dB is corresponding to very
interesting case.
Some pressure level or Lp that is defined
as
ten log, ten, ten stands for deci.
And, this value we call Bell, so we call
this as decibel.
And, we see the mean square pressure
with respect to this square of reference
pressure
and reference pressure is 20 micro pascal,
okay?
3, what's 3 dB means?

Okay?
If p square average is two times of p
square reference, then,
I calculate 10 log10, 3 plus 0, right?
And 10 log10 3 is
what?
What is, 10 log10 3 is what?
7?
What is log 10 to the 2?
0.3 something, right?
So 10 log of 10 2 is 3.
So if p square average is 2 times of p
square reference.
Then we got 3 dB, all right?
Suppose, we have,
p square average of a certain signal,
okay?
is twice of p square average of some
signal.
Then, what we will get is 10 log 10 2 plus
10 log 10
p square average zero with respect to p
square reference, right?
So, the increase of decibel scale is 3 dB.
In other words, when we have mean square
pressure, that is twice,
the mean square pressure something then we
will get 3 dB increase.
So 3 dB has very important meaning.
For example, if you have, if you have this
signal.
[SOUND]
Say this is 60 dB,
and you have exactly same signal, same
time
then you will get 3 dB increase, not 2 dB
increase,
but 3 dB increase.
If we hear, [SOUND] this is, [SOUND] 65
dB, and if you have,
two 60 dB, then, what dB you will
hear?
63 dB.
So 3 dB difference
has a very significant meaning.
And another one comes from actually, 
psychoacoustics.
The minimum level of sound pressure level
that human
being can, can recognize the difference is
2 dB.
Which is very close to 3 dB.
I, I have [SOUND] which is about 60 dB, 1
kilohertz.
And I increase this by 2 dB.
[SOUND] I increase, believe it or not
because it's not possible to measure,
but suppose I increase about 2 dB.
It's, it's, it's not, you know, you may
think that, oh, it is increased.
You don't know whether is increased by 2
dB or 2, 3 dB but you may
think that, I mean, something is
increased, so subjectively.
That, that is 2 dB.
So it's, it, it has a significant meaning
whether you can, you can, you can hear.
I mean, you, you experienced about 3 dB
difference
and 6 dB difference and even 1 dB
difference.
So let's demonstrate this.
[SOUND]
Okay this
is white noise.
white noise.
[SOUND] That is 6 dB difference.
And what
about.
[NOISE].
This is 3 dB difference.
And what 1 dB difference.
[SOUND] [SOUND] 
Comparing
with this 3 dB difference
or 6 dB difference,
what you hear.
The SPL difference by 1 dB is very, very,
very small, right?
You can hear the difference because it is
sort of transient signal.
You can compare directly with what you
hear just before.
but for steady state sound, it's not as I
mentioned to you,
2 dB difference is, is minimal SPL
difference that you
can, you can feel that there is a some
difference.
So that is very interesting.
That means, even if you reduced, or
increased the twice
of your sound, when you are hired by
somebody else.
And you, maybe very proud, of achieving
that,
oh, you reduce the noise by, a magnitude
of twice.
Okay, but in dB scale you, you, your, your
supervisor just can,
just to hear oh, there's some decrease,
just a little decrease, subjectively.
In linear scale you, you, you, you claim
that hey this is a big achievement because
I reduced the noise by half or increase
the sound twice.
But evaluation is performed by hearing, and
hearing system
only barely recognize the increase or
reduce the sound.
So as I said again, the objective measure
and subjective measure is quite different.
Now let's move to the another case.
Frequency scale, okay.
Frequency scale, we also use the
logarithmic scale because what we
hear lowest the frequency literature said
we can hear, not
me but very healthy young people can hear
is 20 hertz.
And highest frequency like you guys,
young, healthy.
I'm sure you are all healthy, young,
healthy
[LAUGH] people can hear is about 20
kilohertz
and do you have a feeling of 20 hertz
and
do you have a feeling about 20 kilohertz?
Of course, you do have a feeling about
one kilohertz which is [SOUND],
this is 2 kilohertz.
But
you don't have a chance to experience
about
20 kilohertz or 20 hertz or maybe 30
hertz.
So let's see what it means by frequency.
What it means by frequency?
As you can see here in this, in this
demonstration, the frequency is,
[BLANK_AUDIO]
What is the frequency means?
1 hertz means something is back and forth
in one second, right?
That is 1 hertz, this is 1 hertz because
this is 1 second.
[SOUND]
This is 1 hertz, over there at the
top that says 0.5 hertz meaning something
is oscillating with the period of two.
That is [SOUND]
okay?
And if it's 2 hertz, that means the
periodical oscillation is 0.5 second.
So that is, [SOUND]
okay?
So, if the frequency is getting higher and
higher, that means.
The period is getting shorter and shorter.
So, [SOUND] means that the oscillation
with respect to frequency is one kilohertz
and
the period is 10 to the minus 3 second.
We cannot measure it every time.
Okay?
But if you he, if you, if your ear
is trained by recognizing the frequency,
that will be, nice.
Back to the SPL level, we do have a
certain idea what it, what it is, 60 dB.
What it is, 130 dB, and one.
What it is, 30, 30, or 30 dB.
30 dB corresponding to very quiet
restaurant or a very quiet library, right?
By the same token, we would like to have a
certain feeling about a frequency, too.
Of course you already had a, some
reference
about one kilohertz, because I
demonstrated very often [SOUND].
Let's see other scale.
Ok. Now,
as I mentioned earlier, audible range
infre-, with respect
to frequency ranges from twenty hertz or
twenty kilohertz.
And the music ranges, as you can see in
this demonstration,
start from a few hundred hertz to
less than 20 kHz, okay?
And a speech normally use smaller
bandwidth, over here.
Okay now, let's examine how you feel.
How your ear system
can hear.
So let me ask you to
draw in your notes,
following graph.
This axis,
you draw 125 Hertz,and 250
Hertz, and 500, and then
1 kilohertz, and then 2 k,
and
4k,
and
8k.
Okay?

And then, you put a tick mark over there.

Starting with over here, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.
That will be 1, okay, so you took
mark starting here one to ten.
Okay. Everybody finish?
Now, I will make a
sound of 125 hertz,
in the beginning.
And you will hear the sound of
frequency 125 hertz.
This will come like boom, boom, boom.
Okay?
Intentionally decreasing the sound SPL, in
a,
in a, in a designed you know SPL then you
counted how
many, how many 120 hertz you hear, okay?
To have a correct, I mean relatively
meaningful
measurement, we will give you a
chance to hear 125 hertz sound twice.
Okay?
Maybe you average it, maybe you mark it,
okay?
And then let me start with 125.
[SOUND]
Okay.
Let me have some of the sheets.
Okay this guy's.
I don't whether, you are healthy, right?
Wrong?
Yes.
Okay.
So what we have, what he has, it's like

the beginning, 
six.
8, 500,
1k, 10,
10, 4k, 8k.
[SOUND] 7.
So, comparing his plot with this plot,
is somewhat similar, right?
Let me, have yours, ladies.
Healthy, right?
You're healthy?
Hope so.
[LAUGH]
Her case
is five, six, oh, seven, eight.

2k
Nine.
ten,
Ten.
Woman here higher frequency than how about
yours?
Nothing?
So you didn't hear anything.
[LAUGH] Okay.
So what about you?

Confused?
So you're, you're one is 
[INAUDIBLE].
Okay his one is, the beginning,
6.
8.
8.
8.
2k, 9.
8.
Yeah.
Good.
Similar with the the graph itself.
So, so actually,
even if we have a very bad experimental
condition because of noise, as
well as what you hear is, has to be
involved in room acoustics.
So, what we confirmed, by this, by this
rather crude experiment.
This curve does have some meaning, right?
What does it mean?
In, in, in a frequency range at like one
to, one to in this
range, we hear very sensitive,
okay?
This range and that range is not
as much as sensitive to what we hear in
this range, okay?
So, human, our hearing system, depending
on the frequency.
Some frequency we hear very sensitively,
and some frequency we do not, hear very,
sensitive as, the frequency in the range
of 1 kilo, 2 kilo, 4 kilohertz.
Why?
Maybe to quickly pick up some of the alarm
system, or maybe to effectively
communicate.
Right, it has to be tested and tested
subjectively.
What the, this is, in fact, what our
hearing system does, hear the sound, okay?
So, we see the sound hearing system in
pressure level, SPL, with respect to SPL,
decibel scale.
And also, we examine our hearing system
with
respect to octave scale or frequency
scale, okay?
And another interesting, so, so, it, it, it
ends up having sort of 
equal loudness contour.
What does it mean by equal loudness?
In other words, the average curve provide
equal loudness.
In other words, the loudness is a measure
of how we feel about a sound.
How you feel.
In other words how we loudly hear the
sound.
For example, over here, at one kilohertz,
this is 20 decibels.
That is 20, okay?
And 120, 2,
250 hertz this is actually little bit less
than
25 dB but we hear
the loudness as the same as what we hear
at 1 kilohertz.
Okay. So for example, if we hear
20 hertz, 20 decibels over here along this
line means that
over here we hear, it is 20 decibels
but in, in this frequency, we hear the
loudness about 10 differ.
So this is, this curve shows the equal
loudness, that based on, what we
experienced before.
