In the first week we will talk about the
relation between vibration and waves.
As we, you can see, using this
demonstration, when I oscillate this with
this frequency, you will see the vibration
of string with a rather, a long wave.
But if I oscillate this with a different
frequency,
you will see the vibration with a
different wavelength.
That means the vibration and waves are
very much related.
And also, if I oscillate this with this
frequency
the, the, force I am, I am feeling over
here with respect
to velocity over here, would be very much
depend on
the frequency and the wavelength as you
can see over there.
The reason why we are using this kind of
rather simpler example, in the first week
it, is because this is mathematically
simple and easy to convey
the fundamental concept that is related
with vibration and waves.
Which is one of, one of them would be,
would be impedance.
Developing the fundamental understanding
using this
rather mathematically simple and the
conceptually
simple example: we will, we will go to the
acoustic wave propagation problem.
As you can see in this rather simple
example, this
pipe of course when I generate acoustic
wave over here.
The wave will propagate.
And then coming back because of this
continuity over here.
And this physical phenomena would be very
analogous with what you saw on this
string.
So based on the understanding of a
string, you can, you can understand the
wave propagation and this, a simple one
dimensional acoustic wave propagation.
Those things will be what you what you
learn in this first week.
Thank you.
