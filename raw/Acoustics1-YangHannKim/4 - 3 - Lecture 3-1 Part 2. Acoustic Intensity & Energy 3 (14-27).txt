I will go some of the details about
the resistive and the reactive term of
intensity.
Okay, this is not easy, but it is very
interesting.
What I said in the previous, previous talk.
I use two extreme cases.
At first I said p multiplied by u.
It's not linear operator.
We are operating p as well as u, so you
have to be careful.
And the intensity physically mean,
physically means that the net power flow.
So, intensity certainly provide us how
much energy we can pour into the medium.
And by looking at two extreme case.
One is infinite, infinite medium and then
the
other one is very perfectly refract,
reactive case.
We see the, the meaning of phase
difference between pressure and velocity.
And I think this is very useful
observation you can, you can use later on.
Let me attempt to
introduce intensity.
Okay, say the pressure,
with respect to space and
time, and time fluctuation
component is j omega t and there
is a phase difference phi.
And let us allow the phase difference
depends
on space because there is more general
case.
Okay?
So this is function of x.
Now I attempt to drive, now I attempt to
drive, the complex intensity.
Okay?
Based on this assumed pressure field.
Okay.
That is done, in the text.
Okay.
Using Euler equation, that is again,
pressure across the small distance.
Is equal to rho zero and du, dt.
So, let me get this from this assumed
pressure field.
Okay?
Let's see.
Using the PowerPoint. okay.
So, dp dx, are attempting to have dp dx of
this.
Then, I have a px, therefore I have to
operate the dp dx over here.
And then I have this, right, and I have
to operate d, dx with respect to this
phase.
Right, that is the d phi p dx and multiply
p, and
then I have a minus j because I have j
over there.
Alright?
And the velocity I can obtain from Euler
equation.
Euler equation simply says that minus
dp dx is equal to rho zero du dt.
So what I do is I, I have to integrate
this expression with respect to time, and
then put the minus.
I'm integrating this part with respect to
time.
Give me this same form, but introduce, 1
over minus j omega, because of this,
okay?
And that has to be operate over there and
I have this, that is velocity.
Okay.
And the pressure is, is this.
So, let's see the difference between this
pressure and that velocity.
Okay, even if it has the same exponential
term,
the velocity term has, this part as well
as this part.
Obviously, there is some velocity term
that has the same
phase with this pressure field, but that
some pressure field it
has phase difference with the pressure
field.
Phase difference of j.
Okay?
And then I multiply this velocity with
this pressure,
and only obtaining so called active part.
In other words, the intensity.
I mean, intensity the, in which the
pressure and velocities in phase.
That means I have pressure
over here and this is in phase part.
So, this is what I can obtain, if I
rewrite this one, it looks like that.
Okay, that is interesting,
because this part is the in, is, is, is
the intensity that has the pressure and
velocity has in phase.
As we discuss in the previous example,
when we have
the duct that does not have reflection,
reactive term.
This active intensity, has a cosine
square omega t
minus phi that makes sense as we saw
before.
Because we, we have a cosine square,
there is a mean intensity
and that mean intensity has interesting
property that is associate with pressure
square.
And remember pressure square is associated
with acoustic potential energy.
Because acoustic pre, the, the acoustic
pressure
is p squre over rho zero c square.
So, active intensity is associated with
acoustic potential energy and d phi p dx.
So, what is this?
That is the, phase,
the phi p is the, spatial
phase distribution
and d phi p dx is the
spatial phase change
with respect to space, okay?
So, active intensity certainly represent,
how the energy of the
acoustic, potential energy
propagate with respect to space.
If you look at the reactive intensity, if
you
look at the reactive intensity which is
written over here.
Based on our derivation, reactive
intensity has 2 sine 2 omega t term, which
is fluctuating time, fluctuating with
respect to time with 2 omega.
And reactive term is proportional to dp
square over dx,
instead of d phi p dx.
In, in the previous case, active intensity
is proportionate d phi p dx, okay?
So, reactive intensity is, is, is
certainly expressing how
the acoustic potential in the dp square is
changing with respect to space.
So, if you have more reactive term, you
have more,
more potential energy change with respect
to space.
That makes sense, it's like, for example,
you have a balloon over here.
Okay?
And the balloon has a certain potential
energy, right?
And it, and it re, it, it, if the space is
reactive,
the balloon is, is, is reacting to as
opposed to your pressure.
So that is this term.
These dp square over dx.
And note also that time average of this
reactive term is 0.
Before,
time average of active intensity is not zero.
In fact, the average intensity of active
intensity has this form.
That means active intensity express how
the acoustic potential energy
is propagating with respect to space.
That is d phi, d phi p dx.
Okay.
So that is average intensity.
So, if we look at
average intensity look like that, and the
reactive intensity look like that.
So
look at this term very carefully.
Okay.
If reactive intensity is 0, that means
what?
There is no potential energy change with
respect to space.
If active intensity is 0, what it means?
There is no power flow into the direction
of x.
All right?
So, let's see what would be the complex
intensity.
So, we obtain the intensity has a two
term, one is this and the one is that.
This is average intent, associated average
intensity that this is associated with,
with the reactive intensity and if use a
complex function it look like that.
And this is complex intensity.
I'm sure everybody over there already lost
to, to follow
what I drive, because you didn't drive by
yourself.
I drive, I drove by myself.
I certainly know what it means.
So, I suggest to you to derive this
complex intensity by yourself,
meaning that there will be some homework.
[LAUGH] I'll ask you to derive this
complex intensity.
You often,
remember that the active intensity is,
active intensity is imaginary part of
complex intensity or
real part of a complex intensity in the
book.
Why?
You will see why, if you are, if you
derive this complex intensity.
Okay.
This summarize.
This concludes the, my, derivation about
the complex intensity.
