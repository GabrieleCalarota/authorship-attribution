Of course the wave will propagate in, in,
in, in positive X direction.
Suppose the string is infinite, for
convenience,
for a start, as a starting point.
And we will see the driving point
impedance of this infinite medium.
And then that's the- we would like to see
driving
point impedance of finite string, and what
is the difference.
Okay then, what I can see is the, the
motion,
y, at x equals 0, can be written like
that.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay and then.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
the motion of a string in a whole
direction can be presented as y
exponential minus j.
omega t minus kx.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Alright.
And then the last thing is a simply dy dt.
Because y is the displacement.
The last thing is rate of change of
displacement.
at x equals zero that can be written like
that.
I just take a derivative of this one, with
respect to time that gives me minus j omega
omega.
Okay, and I want to know the velocity at x
equals 0.
That gives me minus j omega y exponential
minus j omega t.
And the force at x equals 0, that we
assume
that it is exponential j minus omega t
[INAUDIBLE].
Okay.
That will be minus TL, dy, dx.
If you look at the force and velocity.
The ratio of force and velocity at x
equals 0,
that is a driving point impedance.
It turns out to be rho_L c.
That
means the driving point impedence is
exactly the
same as the characteristic impedence of a
string.
no reflection, everything is propagating,
from the point at x equals 0.
So this is very simple.
But let me try to put some physics on this
driving point impedance.
First, I could say because driving point
impedance is
the same as the characteristic of
impedance of a string.
That means when I oscillate over there
what I feel is
the characteristic impedance of the medium
which is rho_L c.
So what I actually feel is that the medium
is infinite.
That is a very important.
Driving point impedance is the measure of
impedance at one point
but it describes what's going to happen in
whole space.
So
that is interesting.
So if you want, if you measure driving
point at one point,
but you can see that whether or not there
is a reflection or not.
By just measuring one point, we can
describe what's going to happen in whole
space.
And actually I can feel them, when I
oscillate
with a certain frequency, I can feel
whether there is a reflection or not.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay let's consider the other case.
Suppose I have a string
that has
finite termination at x equals L.
At x equals L this has to be 0.
In other words,
somebody's a holding my string.
Therefore, the boundary
condition at x equals L,
say a displacement has to be
filled.
Reason why I use L minus x instead of x
minus L,
expression of L minus x is I am
observing the wave, observing the
vibration of the wave.
With respect to
L minus x, that means I am seeing the wave
with respect to the length scale L.
x minus L has rather different.
physical meaning, Okay.
Then again I can calculate the velocity in
the
y direction by just simply operating the
dy dt over there.
Then minus j omega will come out
y sin kL and the x, I said, I want
to know the velocity at x equals 0,
therefore I got this expression.
That is velocity.
What about the force?
Force is minus TL dy dx as we saw, in the,
in the, in the previous case.
And this looked like that.
And the driving point impedance is this
one divided by this one.
Wow, this is interesting.
One interesting scene is, because, I am
dividing this one by that.
I got
cosine, k L divided by sine k L.
That is one of the tangent k L.
So driving point impedance does depends on
KL in
the manner of tangent KL, and this term
is the same.
There is no exponential j omega t
dependency.
And this one will exhibit some other
interesting thing.
So driving point impedance of finite string
has
imaginary part and rho_L c that is
the characteristic impedance.
Okay.
Without that and without j that is exactly
the
same as the driving point impedance of
infinite string.
But it has imaginary part j.
What does it mean by j?
Okay.
That is interesting point.
I have a force f and I have a response.
If it has imaginary part, that means the
force
and response has face difference of a 90
degree.
Right?
What does it mean?
If there is no face difference, difference
like rho_L c
that means when I push the medium with a
force f.
The medium will immediately respond
without having any phase difference.
Okay this is important.
When you have a phase difference of j that
means
when I push the medium or in this case,
when I excite the medium,
The media will respond with a phase of 90
degree, j.

There is some phase lag.
Why it has a phase lag?
For infinite medium case, when I excite,
the medium responds immediately.
But because the medium has a finite length
there is a phase difference.
Or in other way, if I measure the medium.
by driving point impedance.
And then if I find there is a phase
difference
then I can immediately say this medium is
finite.
Okay, if I measure driving point impedance,
and if I found
two terms, one is real part and the other
one is imaginary part.
And the real part is rho_L c, I can
say the medium has an infinite characteristics.
In other words there is something that is
going forever.
In, in a positive direction.
If there is some imaginary part that
measures the driving point impedance,
then I can say there is something that is
related with the finite string.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay?
I will show you.
By using the demonstration.
This
is very important.
Okay.
Now.
When I excite a system.
[SOUND]
What you can see is
something that is propagating and something
that is back and forth.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
For example, in 3D case.
[SOUND]
When I,
Okay.
Suppose you have many different strings.
And you excite it.
What you hear, one is direct feel and
the other one is something reverberant.
For the string case, when I excite,
what you see in the beginning is
a direct wave is propagating in that
direction.
That is rho_L c.
And if the other one is something
back and forth, that is j,
rho_L c, cotangent KL.
So essentially, this term
essentially exhibit
how the finiteness of string exhibit in space.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
It does depends on KL.
What is KL?
KL, what is KL.
K is wavenumber, therefore that is 2 pi
over lambda.
Therefore KL certainly represent
how the L, you know, we have
with respect to wavelength.
So KL is 2 pi L over lambda, so actually
this part
says how, how the finite dimension of, of
the
string L, has to be scaled by wavelengths
lambda.
So if wavelengths is very small compared
with L, that means this
cotangent kL
as many, many, many zeros and infinity.
And if lambda is very, very large compared
with L.
Then this cotangent KL which is 1 over
tangent kL
and wavelength is very large compared
with L,
then this cotangent KL which  one of tangent KL,
and wavelength is very large compared with L, then,
that tangent kL is, can be approximated as kL.

Okay.
Then this one, is j rho_0 c L kL.
Okay let's see some of the details.
okay.
So this shows the character the the
driving point impedance of finite string,
scale this j rho_L cs.
It is very interesting.
At this point driving point impedance is
zero.
What does it mean?
Because driving point impedance is
a measured between the
force acting at a one point over velocity.
Therefore, 0 means the velocity is
infinite.
So this point
means that we have resonance.
What does it mean?
So when I oscillate the string over here,
even if I use very small amount of
force this point [SOUND] exists out of
oscillation that is a resonance.
What about over here,
driving point impedance is infinite.
That is
and when if I exert a lot of force, the
velocity is almost zero.
So that, that means, that point is
antiresonance, and that
point is that is very hard to move the
string
well, let's looks at some detail.
Pi over 2 then K L is pi over 2 and
the K is 2 pi over lambda,
therefore 2 pi over lambda L over L.
Therefore, what is this lambda
is quarter wavelength.
So when I add the resonance the string
was I mean is is quarter wavelengths
string oscillate
[SOUND]
This
case one string has half wavelength
we have
very large driving point impedance.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So
if you measure driving point impedance
properly,
then you can measure the whole medium
whether it
has anti-resonant behavior or resonant
behavior.
Essentially driving point impedance.
can measure the physics of medium.
Okay, I summarize in many driving point
impedance.
For string, rod, bar, membrane and so on,
so on.
Infinite case and a finite case.
Okay.
This summarized, I mean this, this is the
what I intended to say today.
In this lecture I, I, I delivered two
important messages.
One is,
how much reflected, how much
transmitted.
is totally determined by the
characteristic
impedance of medium which is rho_L c.
And second, what I said is driving point
impedance certainly exhibit the
characteristic of medium.
So, driving point impedance of infinite
string is rho_L c
which is the same
as characteristic impedance of string.
That means if the medium as driving point
impedance is the same
as the characteristic impedance of medium,
there would be no reflection at all.
It makes sense, but-
[BLANK_AUDIO]
if the medium is a finite of course there
should be some reflection back.
And a driving point impedance of that case
is j,
that is the that means there's a phase
difference of 90 degree.
And
the rho_L c, and
the characteristics of medium is all
compressed in the expression of cotangent KL.
And KL is a measure of space, in other
words KL means 2 pi over Lambda.
I mean L over two, no no two pi L over
lambda.
So we are seeing the length L with respect
to wavelength
lambda.
Alright?
So as we saw,
as we saw in, in, in the previous graph,
if KL is very
small over here, the driving point
impedance goes up.
Okay?
So we have to see the all the length scale in
acoustics.
With a, with a respect to lambda
that means KL.
And later on we will see the and
any other case we always
see the length scale wi, wi, wi, wi, wi
with respect to wavelength of Lambda.
So please enjoy
deriving point impedance as well as,
characteristic impedance
