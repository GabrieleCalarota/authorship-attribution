Okay.
Let's see the for the flexural wave case.
Again, the incident wave is propagating
that wave,
therefore the infinite wavelength is like
that, and
the reflected wave has to be like that and
transmitted wave has to be like that.
And interestingly, in this case, this has
to be same as the, kb.
That, I mean, lambda b, okay?
And lambda b is the bending
wave, wavelengths
that is related with kb in terms of the
dispersion relation, okay.
And in this dispersion relation, is not
same as the dispersion relation
that we saw that is k equal omega over c.
Okay.
That is the dispertion relation we
observed in a fluid compressive,
compressible fluid like a, like a, air or
water.
Lets see how we get the dispersion
relation of bending wave.
Dispersion
relation of
bending wave.
Remember how we get this dispersion
relation?
Everybody remember, how we get this
dispertion relation.
Okay, we have gorvening
equation.

That relates how this spatial
distribution, spatial, spatial gradient,
gradient of a spatial gradient is related
with a temporal change of sound pressure.
Okay?
And we know that.
The solution, I mean, one solution of,
that
satisfies this equation has to be plane
wave.
And then we argued that we have a complex
pressure, and then explanation minus
j, omega t, minus k vector r.
For simple case, for plane wave one
dimensional case that has to be
explanation minus j omega t minus kx, or
if I omit the notation of x that is kx.
And plot this one over there.
Give us dispersion relation.
Dispersion relation is nothing, but
determining the relation
between, temporal oscillation and spatial
oscillation.
In this case spatial oscillation and
temporal oscillation is, is pretty much
linear.
But, that would not be true for the medium
like a, like a plate we will see, okay?
So let me, let me go back what we did, we
assume Pi and Pr and Pt.
And we know that there is a bending wave
propagating
into y direction, if you use this x and y
coordinate.
Okay?
And what we'll do, is just apply the
boundary condition as we before, as we did
before.
What kind of boundary condition we will do?
Okay, I would say that pressure over here
and the pressure over here, that would be,
the pressure over would be Pi, plus Pt tr,
and the pressure over here would be Pt.
So, I will say that Pi plus Pr minus Pt
which is the net
force acting on this plate per unit area.
And that will introduce the vibration or
wave propagation of, of a plate.
And then also we can say that the velocity
induced by
Pt and Pr and Pi has to be same as the
velocity
induced by the plate and also we can, we
can say that
velocity induced by Pt in x direction
sas to be same as the velocity of plate in
x direction.
Okay?
So, this is assumed pressure
field.
Subscript i, r, and t is simply
indicating incident and reflected and
transmitted awave.
And I assume that the wave, a bending wave
is propagating in y direction.
This is y direction.
This is y direction.
With wave number kb.
Okay.
And I just used the Newton second law on
the plate.
This is the net pressure, in other words,
force acting per unit volume, and x equals
0.
That has to be balanced by the, bending
wave.
That is, m is mass per unit
in an area of the plate, and b is bending
rigidity.
Interestingly, this term, we would look at
this term, for the plate.
This term,
has to be replaced by the tension per unit
length.
Okay?
This term has very interesting form,
because it has d
to the 4th to the d, y to the 4th.
Because of the the due to the bending
rigidity.
Therefore, I mean this is typical, you
know, bending rigidity.
We assume, of course, the simple plate or
Euler.
Bending our Euler Euler,
beam, or Euler plate, which means that
plane section remains
plane physically that means, when I, bend
the plate,
the plate went it was like that, should
remain as
plane, that means the sheer effect upon
the cross section is negligible.
This, in other words, this means that the
thickness of
plate is very small, compare with what?
Thickness of plate is small compared with,
wavelengths in this case.
Okay.
So, if you have a very high frequency
impinging
to the plate, then this assumption would
not be.
Hold, so that's another very important
note I would like to give you.
So for example in, in, in, in, in audible
frequency like one
kilohertz the wide lens is overall more
than 30 centimeter.
So like this.
Right.
Therefore if he, if he are considering the
plate that has this thickness that's the
usual plate.
Then this assumption pretty practical.
So let's go up to ten kilohertz then we
have.
3.4 centimeter plate.
In this case, this assumption might not be
practically
acceptable, but could produce very
reasonable results.
So, again, emphasizing that the bending, I
mean, everything has to be scaled by.
I mean everything associated with the length
scale has to be scaled by wavelengths.
Absolute scale like one centimeter and ten
centimeter and one meter thickness
of plate, does not have any meaning in
acoustics or wave propagation in general.
Okay.
And using the assumed solution, this, we
obtain this kind of dispersion relation.
That is very interesting to, demonstrate
to this
dispersion relation, saying that kb to the
force is proportion to omega square
In other words.
What?
What does it mean?
Okay, let's draw the
some picture.
Okay, this is the dispersion relation.
In the beginning, we had kb to the 4th,
that is m over b omega square.
That is same as this.
Okay.
That look like this.
And this line is k equal omega over c and
is, that just expresses the the, dispersion
relation we saw for the medium like water
and air.
Okay, because this k equal omega over c,
therefore what we can obtain over here.
That is omega one.
And this is k1 and a slope of this is 1
over c,
or you may see this is the, this is the,
this one over, okay, this one over that
one would be.
The indicating speed of propagation.
And that has to be same in this case.
But, if you look at this curve.
The, this one.
This one over this one, and this one over
that one.
It's different.
That means speed of propagation at each
frequency, is different.
In other words the medium is dispersive,
dispersive medium.
In fact.
In fact, in this case, this is a
higher frequency that, that, in, compared
with that frequency.
Or higher frequency, higher frequency,
this one.
Okay.
This one over that one is, higher than
this one over, over that one.
Therefore, higher frequency wave propagate
faster than lower frequency wave.
So, when I, when I make, when I make.
This kind of tool waves and this wave will
propagate faster than
this wave, because of this dispersion
relation.
So when you have, when you generate a
bending wave in
a plate, when you actually measure it, you
will see the.
The higher frequency will arrive at the
position of your measurement.
Then the low frequency.
And this is, this is the case of bending
wave.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
But for water wave.
It's different.
The water waves is exactly different
wave.
The longer wave, longer wave
propagate faster than short wave,
in other words, low frequency wave
propagate faster than high frequency wave.
So when, when, it is right.
Long for, longer frequency, low, I mean
short frequency where
that is long frequent at long wave,
wavelengths propagate faster than
high frequency wave, that is short wave.
Okay, so what you see in a sea shore,
then you would see a very long wave.
That could happen.
More than one hour or for example,
more than 20 minutes, or 30 minutes.
Those, the, the, the, the sea line will
move up very slowly and
that means there's something, some wave
is traveling from far away from us.
So in, in, in the the people who lives who
live very long time on a sea shore, they
can predict.
Storm, by just observing that kind of long
wave, in advance.
Okay, that is very interesting related
with dispersive medium and dispersion
relation.
And, and actually this is not very much
related with.
What we are going to study in linear
acoustics.
Anywaves, it is interesting that therefore
I introduce to you.
Okay, mathematically, we can say the
velocity
due to incident where this is velocity due
to incident.
And this is the velocity due to reflected,
in x direction.
Okay.
This is the velocity due to the incident
wave in x direction this wave.
I put cosine theta i, that means.
I multiply cosine theta i over here,
divide by, specific impedance of medium,
that is velocity, because the impedance is
related, p over velocity.
So, this is the velocity, and this is the
velocity of reflected wave.
The reason why I put the minus sign is
because.
As we talked before reflected wave in x
direction, has to
be the relative sign compare with the
incident wave of incident wave.
And that has to be same as the velocity
of, of plates, that is simply
the I'm taking rate and change of, of
displacement of
plate which is a multiply exponential
minus j omega t minus
kb, why, because the, bending wave is
propagating in the y direction.
That's why I got minus j omega because I
take a derivative.
With respect to time.
And I'm evaluating the, those on x equals
0 that's why I got only j kb y that has
to be the same as the
fluid particle on the transmission side.
That is again Pt.
Over Z0, and multiply cosine theta t and
that has to be same as this.
And interesting that this theta i and the
sine theta r,
that is the, that is the xxponential term.
And in this exponential term has to be
same.
In other words, ki sine theta i, sine
theta and the kr
sine theta r, and kt sine theta t has to
be same.
Therefore, to get a solution, this has to
be the same.
Right?
You have exponential something
and exponential something, exponential
something.
And you have some, alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3.
Okay, this exponent has to be same,
otherwise it cannot get the solution.
Right?
So this is same, and that has to be, a
whole and then that has to be whole.
The last one is important because that,
this is that term.
Okay, so.
To solve the solution and we got tau,
okay?
And here is an interesting attempt,
because you move this Z0 to there.
Then which is similar with what we have
for the limp wall case.
Then the limp wall case we have 2Z0 and 2Z0
and plus j omega m minus.
That minus j omega comes from, the limp wall
equation.
And as I said, before, before generally we
can say, z
tau composed by two component, one is
partition impedance and the other one is
fluid loading impedance.
In this case, these are fluid loading
impedance and these
are partition impedance, therefore, we can
say this is partition impedance.
And interestingly, this partition
impedance has two components.
One is limp wall contribution.
Simply saying that the transmission
coefficient is
related with 1 over minus j omega m.
Again it follows mass law.
What is mass law?
Mass law simply say later on transmission
loss.
Will be increase, increased 6dB for octave of
frequency or mass doubling the mass.
So generally, it will follow this mass
law, but it is related with this partition
impedance that is interesting because it
is proportionate to 1 over omega.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
So, let's look at some more detail about
this.
So, we found that
total transmitted, I mean transmitted
wave, look like that.
Okay.
See, interesting.
This term simply says, it is propagating
in y direction with wave number of kb.
That makes sense.
Because in y direction.
In the previous case when we do not have
any structure
of the interference because of inviscid
assumption there is no propogation
in y direction, but this time we do have
some inter, some
interface that forces our fluid to move in
y direction.
So when you have, when you employ the,
when you employ
the plate you are actually providing
some mechanism that allow fluid to
propagate in
y direction not only in x direction, but you
also provide the mechanism
that can move fluid particle in y
direction, and number waves per unit
length is lambda b and the associative
wave length, wave number is kb.
And this is what you can see
mathematically,
what I explain physically is expressed
mathematically over here.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Disappear.
Okay?
And what, what does this mean?
This describes a propagation in x
direction.
Okay, that's very interesting.
It propagate with, let me write it again
in more exaggerated way, bigger
way, x0 square root mi, 1 minus kb over k0
square x.
Okay.
It is propagating in x direction.
Depending on the magnitude of?
Wave number in bending, bending wave
number, kb, and k0.
Okay, k0 is simply omega over c0, and the
c0 is
the speed of propagation in air or water
simply surrounding fluid.
So that is interesting because if kb over
k0 is smaller than 1,
than this one is greater than, I mean is
positive,
therefore there is a wave propagation in,
x direction k0 multiplied by this amount.
However if kb over k0 is larger than one
we
don't know what it means physically, but
just mathematically we
can observe that if kb over k0 is larger
than
1 then this whole term is negative that
means this term.
As an imaginary path, imaginary path
multiplied imaginary path or produced
minus sign with, with disregard of plus
sign.
That means the wave in x direction
exponentially decay in this case.
That is interesting.
That means that if you use a plate in
certain
frequency band, some wave is exponentially
decaying in x direction.
In other words, transmission loss in
x direction will be, not transmission,
sorry.
Transmission coefficient in x direction will
be exponentially decaying.
And that would be very interesting.
We will, we might attempt to find
some application area, based on the
interesting phenomenon.
Okay.
So let's look at some more details about
this.
And interestingly kb over k0 also.
Involves in a magnitude of scale.
Okay?
That is the magnitude of scale that it has
to be scaled 1 over this
scale root value, if kb over k0 is larger
than 1, this 1 has to be.
Imaginary part.
So, the pressure magnitude of, of pressure
would be
rather different magnitude of pressure
when kb over k0 is smaller than 1.
So lets look at some detail about this.
Of course this is not, this is not
is a major you know, major part of the
lecture I would
like to deliver today, but it's certainly
interesting, some of our
students might have an interest to use
this kind of peculiar
rather interesting behavior in certain
application.
Okay.
If I convert this wave number
into frequency domain or in terms of speed
of propagation.
Then that it will look like that.
So this is, so if cb is greater
than c0, that means bending
wave speed is greater than c0.
Recall that this was case of supersonic.

Then this one is real value.
And there is a wave propagating as
You know, we so often in x direction but
if c0 over
cb is greater than 1, in other
words, cb is smaller than c0 that we call
sub-sonic case.
Then the wave in x direction propagate, I
mean, decays exponentially.
Okay?
Things like that.
So, that we call supersonic and subsonic
case, which is often very important in
certain.
The structure.
Okay.
This explains more.
This is the plot that come from the
dispersion relation.
So speed of propagation of bending wave,
is proportional to square root of omega.
Therefore as we increase the frequency,
the speed
of propagation increases square root of
the frequency.
So, therefore the curve looks like that.
So this is the frequency when, the speed
of propagation is
the same as the speed of propagation of
air or water.

It's the case where we have kb equal
has the same direction in the ky
and this is the case when speed of bending
wave is larger than speed of medium,
then we have a supersonic case and this
is the case when we have subsonic case.
