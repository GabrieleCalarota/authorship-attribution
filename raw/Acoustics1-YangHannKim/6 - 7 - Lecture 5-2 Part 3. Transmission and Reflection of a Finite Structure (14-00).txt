So this summarize, what I wanted to argue
today.
Okay?
For limp wall case, when we have
incident wave then, because
of the discontinuity we have reflective
and pt.
And we prove that
this is equivalent with having 2Pi,
which we called blocked pressure and the
radiation due to the
vibration of limp wall which will vibrate
minus j omega t time.
So there will be some radiation this is
Pt.
So is physically very straight forward.
If you have a fission radiation, you have
many, I mean, some pressure outside.
Therefore, you have large Pt.
For the noise control purposes,
you would like to have a small Pt, in
other words, no radiation.
No radiation is the case when you have
a rigid wall, and that is not practically
admissible.
Okay?
You might want to have some wall that has
some filtered characteristics,
in other words, filtered, what I meant by
filtered is it has a bad, and
less radiation efficiency among certain
frequency band.
And it has a good radiation efficiency,
and other than that you
can use that band to control the noise,
that you want to control.
So consider the frequency characteristics
of this partition.
You may design a good partition, [COUGH]
by
seeing the radiation of this partition.
I used the same concept to argue that
transmission loss of infinite partition.
Or infinite plate,
is smaller than transmission coefficient
or finite plate.
By introducing this radiation concept, and
we will, we will use
this radiation concept to explain later,
next, in the next chapter.
Radiation scattering diffraction in
unified way.
So, if you understand radiation,
you understand scattering diffraction,
everything.
So radiation is sort of key concept that,
explains almost everything except the room
acoustics, and the acoustics.
Okay.
So, limp wall
is simply there's a two blocked pressure,
and radiation.
Okay if you have a more general
partition that has spring, and damping
using this concept understanding what is
going to happen, due
to this, this kind of partition is rather
simple because.
There is a same blocked pressure, and then
radiation of this partition that has
not only mass, but also spring and dashpot.
Okay, dashpot is useless in most case,
because dashpot.
If I use the frequency that is far beyond
the
resident frequency of this partition then
it follows mass law.
Okay.
So we saw interesting picture, like this
follows mass law over here.
Okay.
Blocked frequency.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Follows 132 divided by mass per unit area
for that sort of thing.
And I said, in the last lecture, this is
the key idea, essential understanding.
This actually opens the essential
understanding about the partition.
Noise control problem.
All right?
Back to this problem, then, again, the
transmission will be, induced by
the radiation of this kind of partition.
And, [COUGH] tau, I will recall,
is proportional to fluid loading
impedance.
Okay, this, this is interesting formula,
actually I got this formula
from Beranek,
and for linear acoustics,
this holds for every case.
Okay?
And move on to the finite plate case.
But, we just studied the transmission
coefficient for infinite case.
But, I argued that
transmission co, loss of infinite case
certainly predicts upper bounds of
all finite case, plate case, therefore
this rather.
Safe guideline to use transmission loss
based on infinite plate case.
Okay, we have a remaining things.
Okay, sound does not impinge to the flat
surface of this, this
in normal incidence or, or have a some angle
theta i only.
I mean sound, sound will,
arrive at flat surface of discontinuity
in, many different directions.
So, how can you use this result to the
case of which
we have random incidence case, in other
word, in other case, it other words?
This is normal incidence case, random
incident means the sound comes from
everywhere.

Okay.
How can you, we use this result to the
random incidence case.
Conclusion.
We just invited some correction factor,
which is not big,
because think about in this way.
If you have this of a lake incidence case,
okay.
Major radiation will be induced by the
component of normal to the surface, okay?
So that would be the major contribution.
The correction factor.
Due to the presence of this kind of wave
in this
case very negligible, in this case there
would be some contribution.
So in the text you can find the, the
several very,
practically used for correction factor.
You can use it.
Or, if you are very brave, and you, if you
have enough time, you may have
a simulation, or you may try to get the
transmission coefficient.
For every incident angle case.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
Okay?
So, that's the, end of our, our, lecture
to summarize what I have talked.
So, let me, let me, see what we had
before.
Well let me summarize.
We begin,
with Snell's law.
[COUGH]
And because the, what Snell's law
physically
says it has to matched on the boundary.
In such a way that the, the fluid particle
arranged over here, has to move
in the manner that the motion of the fluid
practically in this part, and that part
has to be
same in x direction, not y direction
because we assume the inviscid fluid.
So, we look at the Snell's law in terms of
wave number domain.
And advantage of looking at Snell's law in
wave number domain is bec-, it it
certainly exhibit.
So-called exponentially decaying wave in X
direction.
Okay.
And then we move to the case for the
plate for having plate as the
discontinuity.
And we we look at the mathematical
formulation that determines how much
predict, transmitted wave will be induced
compared with the incident wave.
And we found that this kb has to be same
as.
The wave number of fluid particle in this
direction, that has to be, okay?
As well as the wave number of transmitted
wave in this direction, too.
Okay?
And also we assume that this wave zeta
which is, which is a function of y in this
case, okay?
That has certain amplitude and the
propagation look
like exponential minus j omega t minus
kb y.
Okay,
using that assumed solution to
the plate equation, we obtain interesting
dispersion relation.
Physically, the wave on a plate according
to that dispersion relation.
Says, the long wave propagate, slower than
short wave.
And the high frequency wave propagate,
first of them,
low frequency wave.
And.
We [SOUND] argued that using [SOUND],
while I draw in this Picture,
an infinite plate case.
As the finite plate case, the transmission
coefficient of finite plate
has to be larger than infinite case.
Therefore per unit area transmission loss
of infinite
plate case would be greater than equal to
the finite plate case therefore.
Our prediction based on infinite plate
would be safe, noise control guideline.
To understand why we got a more
transmission coefficient for finite plate
case, seeing what's going to happen.
As, if we are fluid particle then we can
understand,
because if you oscillate this then the
fluid over here, and over there
will more effectively influenced by the
motion of the plate.
Okay.
And then I emphasized again every
transmission coefficient is in terms, it
can be expressed in terms of fluid loading
impedance, and partition impedance.
In the case of bending waves partition
impedance has two components.
One is limp wall partition coefficient that
is minus j omega m.
The other one, what is associated with a
bending rigidity.
Okay, that's what I'm going to say today.
Goodbye
