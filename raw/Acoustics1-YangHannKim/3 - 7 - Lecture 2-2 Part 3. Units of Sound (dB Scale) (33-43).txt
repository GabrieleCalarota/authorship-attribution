Let us see now, we have
governing
equation, okay.
And then we know the relation
between p, rho, and u,
and now we know the relation
between energy and intensity.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Those threes are the major mathematical
or theoretical description that involves
an acoustic wave
when there is no convection.
Also, the pressure is
small enough to be linearized and the
velocity is small enough to
be linearized and excess density is small to
be linearized.
All right?
And then what about the
solution, typical solution of this wave
equation?
One typical solution
is, as I mentioned before, is a plane
wave.
[SOUND]
Okay.
Plane wave.
Plane wave means that the wave front is a
plane.
So one dimensional plane wave can be
written as p x t.
x is the coordinate in this direction.
And I can write, there is a certain
magnitude, maybe I
will say cosine kx minus omega t.
That is one possible plane wave.
Okay?
This can also be written as
the real part of
complex amplitude of p zero hat,
exponential j kx minus omega t.
Okay.
I introduced complex, real
part, real part of this.
p zero is complex.
Okay?


00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:36,753
Now, because we are handling linear
differential equations, because we are,
because we are handling linear
differential
equation, if p0 hat exponential
jkx minus omega t satisfy governing
equation, wave equation, then real part
has to be
satisfied or imaginary part has to be
satisfied.
Therefore, instead of using cosine and
sine, now
we can use complex notation everywhere in
linear
acoustics, because we are handling
acoustics that
is governed by this linear acoustic wave
equation.
In other words, I can put real over there,
still, it works.
Or imaginary over there, it works.
So we need to express everything
in acoustics in complex.
Okay?
And a second example would be p
three dimensional wave, okay.
p r,t.
That has certain magnitude p0
hat, but, but decaying with
respect to r, and exponential
j, k, r dot minus omega t.
Okay, now I introduced wave number vector
k vector.
What is k vector?
k vector has three component.
One is wave number in x direction and the
other one is wave number
in y direction and the other one wave
number in z direction.
[SOUND]
In other
words, this wave
is propagating,
in space,
like in space
like that.
But the magnitude is decreasing 1 over r,
and this is called monopole.
In other words, pole simply means
something
that has singularity at a certain
position.
Here is the case, this one has a
singularity at r equals zero.
At r equals zero, the pressure goes to
infinity.
And the mono stands for it does have only
one pole.
If I plot this one to wave equation,
we can immediately
see that this will satisfy the wave
equation.
Okay?
Let's check it, whether this satisfy the
wave equation.
Now what is the Laplacian p of this?
Not easy, right?
We have to operate 1 over r, as well as j
k r and so on, so on.
Okay?
[NOISE]
Okay, what
other possible
solution?
Maybe a dipole.
In other words, there's two poles which is
separated
in certain, certain, certain distance.
These kind of things can all satisfy the
wave equation.
Therefore what it can see in the text or
theory, they said, okay, we, the any
pressure field can be, can be described
by the sum of distributed monopoles,
dipoles, quadrupoles, so on, so on, so on.
That we call the multipole expansion
method.
Later on we, we will have a chance to go
detail about it.
Okay, this, this concludes, the topic, I'd
like to handle in chapter one in the
beginning.
What I said is, linearize the acoustic
wave equation, governs all the waves.
Second, I introduced
energy relation between energy and
intensity.
And I also introduce the three prime
variables, which is pressure, velocity and
density.
Okay, that is a physical value, but
we have to see, or we have to, we have to
get some standard or unit that can, that
can make those variables come to us.
In other words, there is a physical
variable p rho u, energy and intensity.
But to get a feeling, we have to somehow
put their value in terms of units.
Right?
So let's see the units of those variables.
First, first
pressure, unit
of pressure.
Okay, pressure is a force divided by area,
and unit of force, what is it?
Unit of force?
An MKS unit is Newton.
And area is m k s unit, unit meter
square.
So, the pressure is Newton divided by
meter squared.
And this is called pascal.
[SOUND] Okay one pascal, it simply means
that one Newton per meter square.
So, suppose how much pascal will
experience
the surface just beneath of my foot.
I calculate my weight is about 60, no 50
kilograms, believe it or not.
Let's assume my weight is 50 kilogram.
And the force exerting through the
floor
would be 50 kilograms multiplied by 9.8
meter square, gravitational acceleration.
And I have divided
two surface by foot.
Okay?
And the length of my foot is
approximately, I don't know.
What?
30 centimeter, that large?
>> Including shoes, okay.
For, for, for easy calculation, lets say
that is 0.3
meter and this is approximately 0.1 and I
have two,
so this as to be 0.3 multiply 0.1 multiply
by 2.
That is 6.
So, I have to multiply 10 to the square
over there and this divide by 6.
And I have 6.
9.8 divided by six would be 1.6.
1.6 multiply 50 would be 80.
So 80 multiply 100, so 8000
pascal.
Wow.
8,000 pascal.
Anybody have a feeling about pascal?
No.
Therefore, the pressure
scale is measured by
using a relative scale.
Because, as I demonstrate, this pascal
does not really provide us real, you know,
real feeling.
So we use scale of decibel.
And decibel is a measure of acoustic
pressure.
Deci stands for 10 over here.
And then we are using log of 10, log
of 10, not log of e, log of 10.
And
then p square average.
That is [SOUND]
mean of square, mean square, mean
square.
So that is, I integrate the pressure,
square, for certain periods of time,
and divide by T.
That is mean square value, okay, mean
square value.
All right?
Mean square value.
For example, I have [SOUND] if I square
this,
what I get is square and then square,
and then square, and then square,
and then square, and then square.
Therefore, being square value would be
somewhere over here.
That is p square average, mean square
value.
Okay so, so mean square value of [SOUND]
one kilohertz.
is not zero.
Okay.
You got it?
And it does have a physical meaning.
Now, as we look at this mean square value
with respect to square value of reference.
And the p reference is,
p reference is 20 micro Pascal.
What is strange, this strange number?
What is a 20 micro Pascal?
Who invented this?
Okay.
Because acoustic pressure we can sense,
the range of acoustic pressure we can
sense is so wide.
Did everybody hear the sound I made?
Pretty sure, raise your hand.
I didn't blow, I didn't make any sound.
[SOUND]
Okay, okay.
And then, and then I make big sound.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
I didn't make a sound.
[LAUGH]
Whoa.
And then you hear, right?
So the sound we can hear starts with a
very small one, to a very large one.
In fact, we can normally hear sound little
bit more than 120 dB from zero decibel.
Zero decibel means 20 micro Pascal.
And the 20 micro Pascal often referred as
the sound
that very healthy, young students can
hear.
You guys over there can hear very small
sound, right?
So when I was a student my teacher said,
it's the sound like you drop
a small needle from one meter above the
floor.
That's the 20 micro Pascal that you can
hear.
I don't know, I didn't test it.
Maybe we test, like pick up a small
needle, very thin and one
meter and then measure it whether it is
really 20 micro Pascal or not.
Maybe you guys have fun out of it.
Yeah?
Because that is the smallest of pressure
we can hear, we always,
always, always measure 
mean square pressure with the respect to
smallest sound pressure.
Okay, so that is decibel.
And the decibel is very interesting.
And also, 3 dB, 3 dB,
3 dB is minimum pressure
that human being can
recognize the difference.
But unfortunately, 3dB is in linear scale,
is twice of the pressure.
We will, we will see that later on.
So when you, when you work on in noise
problem, when you reduce the noise level
twice, then your supervisor will not
appreciate because the 3dB is
just perceivable noise difference by how
say human being.
Okay?
So a text you can see the rough reference
about, to feel about the decibel scale
just to say in your lecture hall
at the moment,
when I do, when I do not say
anything, your lecture hall would be
without any sound,
about 40 dB.
Maybe 40 to 45 dB.
When you go to cafeteria, when you go
cafeteria I don't know whether you have a
very
fancy nice, you know, fascinating
cafeteria,
but for usual, normal university cafeteria
is a loud, is very loud.
It's very noisy.
That case, that would be maybe more than
65 dB.
If you go to the rock and roll and the
concert hall or, or on a big, big,
big music, that would be more than 80 dB.
Sometimes you feel 100 dB.
Okay?
If you hear the sound coming from rocket,
for example, that would be more than 120
dB.
So variety of decibels scale, you
can, you can, you can hear it.
If you hear the sound coming from the
truck,
big truck pass by, that would be 90 dB or
85 dB.
Okay?
Now
[BLANK_AUDIO]
what if I have two
sources: p1 and p2?
Okay, I have a source that has p square
average [SOUND] 1, that is 80 dB.
And I have another source p square
average 2 that is again 80 dB.
What is the dB, decibel of 1 and 2?
Source 1 and 2, what would be?
That would be 160 dB?
No, because decibel scale is log of
10 p square average over p square
reference, so let's see how to get
the new dB, that is 10 log 10.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
p square reference.
I have a two source.
p square average 1.
And I have another source, p scale
average 2.
Okay?
And what is it?
This is 10 log 10 p square over that plus
this.
Okay?
So I have 10 log 10.
p square reference, Pp square
average, 1 plus p square reference
over p square average 2.
What is this?
This is p squared average at,
okay this is, this is 
10 log 10 p square reference
over p square average 1.
Therefore p square average
over p square reference has to
be I 80 divided by 10 is 8.
Therefore, that, that would, would be 10
to the 8.
Is it correct?
So I plug this one over there, I got.
New decibel is equal to ten log ten.
10 to the eight plus 10
to the eight, that is 10 log 10.
10 to the 8 multiplied by 2, that is 10.
That is 10 to the 10 log 10 to the 8.
That is what 80 dB.
Multiplication will be resolved in
logarithmic operation plus, so I
have 10 to the log with 10 to the 2.
What is log with 10 to the 2?
Log 10 to the 2 is .301, okay.
Therefore this is log of 10 to the 2, so I
have to add the 3 so 83 dB.
So when I have two sources, 80 dB,
then resulting
sound pressure level is not 160 dB but 80
dB.
Okay, another interesting one.
Because decibel
scale, [NOISE]
if I have p square
average as P
square average
big one plus P square
average small one.
For example, I have a big decibel,
that's 100 dB,
and another component that is like 50
dB, maybe
we will make, I will make, I will make 50
dB, and you make 8, 70 dB.
[SOUND]
>> [SOUND]
Okay, I will, I will make a 60 dB, and
you will make a 40 dB.
Okay?
[SOUND] You can not hear 40 dB, right?
You can not hear 40 dB.
So in decibel scale, if, if the, the scale
of two different source, there is a
relatively large and a big difference,
then you don't have to worry about this
small one, because if this
is 100 dB and this is 50 dB, then
total decibel scale would be 100.1 dB.
So for noise control issues, you don't
have to worry about the small noise.
So what, what you have to immediately
conclude that if you
have noise abatement problem, first job
you have to do is
you have to find out major
contribution of noise and then you
you develop the certain way to reduce
the major contribution.
Right?
Because the decibel, because of decibel
scale.
Okay?
So I introduce the significance of decibel
scale that is defined like that.
And the p square average is mean square
pressure and the operation
of decibel scale is not linear so you
have, you have to worry.
I mean you have to very much worry about
how to operate a decibel scale.
I had a letter from one of one of judges.
A local judges and he said, okay the, the,
the, the noise
level of a rifle he measured, not he,
somebody measured is 80 dB.
And you know, there is the place where the
solider has to practice the rifle.
The number of stands over there, is a
twenty, therefore 80 dB and we
have a twenty rifle, you know, exercise
stand, therefore the noise
rendered would be 80 dB multiplied by 20
and that is 1,600.
And that is so big, and he asked me
whether this kind of estimation is correct
or not.
Absolutely not, right?
Absolutely not, because of the the decibel
scale that is defined like that.
Okay, this concludes our fourth lecture
which we,
we, we studied about linear acoustic wave
and
we, we learned about pressure, density and
velocity
is a sort of measure major, major acoustic
variables.
And we also studied about the, the
relation between energy and intensity.
Intensity is nothing but the, the power
per unit area.
Oh I missed, intensity is also vector,
also vector
and energy is not vector, is, is
scalar.
The reason why intensity is vector is
because the power has a direction of
propagation.
And also we introduce the unit of pressure
that is decibel.
The reason why we use a decibel, one
reason is because our hearing system
sense the acoustic pressure from very
small to very large one.
That's why we are using decibel scale.
Next lecture I will explain about octave
scale.
And then other important acoustic
measures, okay.
