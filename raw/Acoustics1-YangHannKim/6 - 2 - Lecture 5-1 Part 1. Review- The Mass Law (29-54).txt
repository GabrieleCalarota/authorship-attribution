Let's review what we learned in the last
lecture, okay.
The last lecture I asked the you know, the
students the
what would be the,
the word that can represent last lecture,
and he answered mass law.
[SOUND]
Then let me ask you.
What is mass law?
Mass law simply says, the
transmission loss or sometimes
writes T.L. is 20 log 10
omega m 2Z0 or Z0 ?
Huh?
2Z0, okay.
2Z0, remember that.
We have a strange number two over there,
okay.
If you look at it carefully, this is a
valid.
This is valid
when omega is sufficiently large,
okay.
When omega is sufficiently large, the
vibration
system normally follow so called mass law,
okay.
I think everybody remember the famous
phase diagram,
that represent, graphically represent,
dynamic behavior
of spring mass system, that
can be expressed symbolically
as many of you already.
So in many times and if the measured
displacement from here, let me
use r instead of c which is often
used in classical vibration
system, but the reason why we do not
use C and use r because we use C as
the speed of sound propagation.
So this is, damping term.
Strictly more precisely speaking, that is
viscous damping, linear damping term.
Then equation of motion that describes
this
single vibtory
system is,
if I say there is external force F of t.
I'm
trying to relate the mass law where the
well known single vibrotary system, okay.
Then let's assume, that [SOUND]
the force applied to this vibratory system
has
some complex magnitude F at exponential
minus j omega t.
Maybe strictly speaking F of t would be
imaginary part of this or real part of
this.
Then,
x of t can be written as some complex
amplitude exponential minus j omega t,
okay?
This physically means that, if we excite a
system with a frequency of omega,
then the force and displacement could
have
some phase difference, okay?
And this, gives us the
expression of ordinary differential
constant
coefficient equation into very well known
form that is minus omega square m.
Plus and that should remind us, g omega r
plus
kx equal
to F.
Okay, that's very well know.
This, not very interesting.
But if you look at this complex expression
in terms of
real part and imaginary part, in
other words, I'm trying to look at this
equality in complex play.
Okay, then, suppose this is X.
X is complex, therefore, it has a real part
as well as an imaginary part.
[SOUND] Okay, and then exponential,
because I am
multiplying this with exponential j omega
t.
Actually, this X has to
rotate with omega, okay,
then kx could be this.
[SOUND]
Okay?
Then I express kx over here, and I'm
trying to express kx
multiplied by minus j omega r, okay?
Minus j has to rotate this in this
direction, okay?
So I will say that is minus j omega r x.
That simply the magnitude of this is r
times
the magnitude of that multiply omega and
then I rotate
the complex with minus j.
That is 90 degrees of course, because
minus j is
simply cosine pi over 2 minus j sine pi
over 2,
or explanation minus j pi over 2.
That means I'm rotating a complex in this
direction,
and then let's look at this term.
It's a minus omega square m. Minus 1 is
minus j multiplied by minus j.
That means I have to, I have to rotate
again.
This arrow 90 degree in this direction
again and then that is minus omega square m.
It makes sense because this one is k x.
This one is minus omega sku m x, and this
is minus of this.
That means, in complex domain, it has to
be 180 degree face difference.
But this, understanding this, [SOUND],
will help you to understand this mass law.
This mass law as I mentioned in the last
lecture, is essential concept that you can
understand the anything related with a
partition design.
Okay?
Okay then.
This equation says this one has to be
equal to F, right?
What it means in complex domain
graphically that means that if I translate
this over there.
Minus j omega rx, and I trans, I move this
over
here in parallel, that is minus omega
square mx.
That this mathematical expression says
that this one plus, and that one plus that one
has to be equal to complex magnitude F.
So, that is F,
and then, what is this?
This angle simply says the phase difference
between force and displacement.
So that is very useful, okay?
And lets see when omega is getting small
and small.
Then this one shrink linearly over there,
and this one shrink proportional to
square.
Because I am reducing omega.
So these ones shrink very rapidly, and
these ones shrink this amount.
Therefore, what I get would be,
something like that.
So in this case, I have to draw F in
circles, right?
But approximately say this is correct,
that means
there is no phase difference between force
and displacement.
So that is physically sensible because
when I have a spring because this is the
case when spring is dominant, spring force
is dominant compared with other force.
So that means when I push spring, the
displacement
of a vibratory system is just to follow
the force.
So when I have a spring and I push the
spring, compressed, and I release, the
spring will follow me.
So for this a very small phase difference.
Okay when omega is getting larger and
larger
as this mass law says what is going to
happen.
What will happen is this will increase.
Rapidly as a square and this will
increasingly linearly.
Therefore, the diagram we will have look
like, look like that.
Therefore, the force and displacement
approach to 180 degree difference,
right?
So, when you ride a car
on a very rough road with high speed,
what's going to happen
is, because excite, excitation frequencies
getting larger and large.
The behavior of your car follow the mass
low.
Follow, I mean the behavior of your car
vibratory
system is dominated by, by minus Omega
scale m over here.
That's why when you ride the car in a
rough road, you feel
is not like this when you drive slowly.
In that case, it follows over there
therefore
the force and displacement has the same
phase.
But when you drive your car in rough road,
then omega is increasing, therefore you
will feel like that is dominated by mass
law.
And that is explained, very well, by using
this phase diagram.
So, that's why there is only
omega m appears over here, because in this
case we are considering this
when the frequency is sufficiently large,
therefore it follows the mass law.
Okay, and another point, this, this, this,
this, this is due
to the observation of this, omega m and
what is 2Z0?
What, why there is a 2?
Okay, let's leave that question later on
to be answered.
And the, the message I'm trying to give
you is that,
this is the formula, that I say, this is
the formula
that expresses mass law.
And each term of the formula is talking to
you, the physics,
the secret behind of this formula, right?
I mean if you just look at the formula,
and say oh, that is
20 log 10 or mega m divided by 2Z0 okay
that's mass low.
So, then the formula do not, does not take
anything secret behind that formula.
But if you look at the formula very
carefully, then the formula open the door
of secret garden.
And there is a hint to enjoy science and
engineering.
So I strongly suggest to you to look at
any formula, key formula, essential
formula, representative, represental
formula, very carefully.
Maybe you look at it for whole one day or
whole one week.
Then you may find another view, which I
did not introduce to you.
You will own another view, your own view,
okay?
So this is why we have a 20, why?
Because, actually, it was proportional to
10 log 1 plus omega over 2Z0 squared.
And, because omega is sufficiently large,
or strictly speaking omega m is
sufficiently large.
In other words, how sufficiently large
omega m over
2Z0 has to be, much, much larger than one,
okay?
Then this mass law holds and from this,
using practical,
guideline,
in other words, due to, to practically use
this mass law.
I suggest to use the concept of block
frequency that
is related with very, again very strange
number, 132 divided
by mass per unit area.
Okay, that's the starting frequency to
estimate.
How much, how much transmission loss you
will obtain
by using this mass law, and that you just
count frequency
you can then obtain how much noise
reduction you can have.
Okay, this is kind of review.
I've introduced the concept of phase
diagram that
visualize very easily the mass law and
vibratory system.
Okay,
then let's move another
concept.
Okay in the last lecture
we found that.
On this limp
wall we assume an incident wave, normal
reflective wave, and transmitted wave.
And
I'll apply the boundary condition over
here that expresses like that.
The pressure reflects incidence
plus pressure magnitude complex, reflected
minus pressure transmitted that is the net
force acting on
the limp wall that has to be equal to mass
times the acceleration.
So, in complex equation, that would be
minus omega square m y.
We assume that this wall will move
y exponential minus j omega t,
and also, we found that the velocity on
this
side would be Pi divided by Z0.
And the Pr divided by Z0, and this is
reflected the wave there
therefore I put minus over there, and that
has to be equal to the velocity of
this wall, that would be minus j omega,
sorry y.
And also the velocity on this side that
has to be Pt
over Z0 has to be equal to minus t omega
y,
and using these three equations, we obtain
the mass law.
Everybody remember that, right?
But let's look at this equation again
carefully in a rather different way,
and try to find out whether or not there
is another, meaning
that you, we could find.
Anything wrong over there?
'Kay, if you find something wrong, please
tell me.
Because I, I often make a mistake.
Okay, sorry this has to be small i.
One
could have
some curiosity.
Then how about the pressure, Pi plus
Pr?
That is the pressure acting on limp wall,
on left hand side.
What is this?
Of course if you look at it, this equation
you can
say that Pi plus Pr is minus omega square
mY plus Pt.

Any other relation I can find.
If we can find Pi plus Pr, in relation
with the Pt.
Okay.
As well as y, that would be, that would be
very interesting.
So from here, what I can see from this two
equations,
what I can see is simply Pi, say.
This is equation one, this is equation
two, this is equation three,
from over here I say [SOUND] equation.
2, I can write Pi minus
Pr is equal to Pt.
Then I can write simply minus Pi plus Pr
is equal to minus Pt.
Okay.
Then I want to have
this Pi plus Pr.
What is this?
And what is Pi plus Pr?
[SOUND] That has to be 2 Pi minus Pt.
[SOUND]
Can anybody follow how I can get this
interesting formula?
[SOUND]
Over
here, [SOUND]
Over here, okay.
Pr is equal to Pi minus Pt.
Therefore Pi plus Pr is 2 Pi minus Pt,
simple right?
Oh.
[LAUGH]
Okay, what does it mean?
That means many things.
Okay. I have a wall limp wall,
and this is the pressure
acting on this limp on the left hand side,
and that is equal
to, according this equality.
[SOUND]
2Pi, what is 2Pi?
Okay, 2Pi
is the pressure that can be sensed by
non-moving wall.
Okay, so I call this blocked frequency, a
blocked pressure.
Plus, minus Pt.
What is minus Pt?
Minus Pt is this.
What is that?
That is minus j omega y, Z0.
That is the oh, that is the pressure
induced by the oscillation of this panel,
this is a velocity and Z0 is
characteristic
impedance that produce pressure.
Because Z0 is P0 over U0.
And this is velocity, so velocity multiply
by the impedance is a pressure.
So this is the pressure induced by the
oscillation of this panel, with
the frequ, with the velocity j omega Y.
So what it essentially says interestingly
is that,
is that, okay.

When we have wall incident, reflected, 
transmitted,
that is equivalent with we have
2 Pi or P blocked frequency,
plus,
oscillation of wall with a velocity j omega
y.
That would produce the Pt.
Okay?
So, actually,
this is very interesting result.
This, this oscillation produce the
radiation,
okay?
Now, everything associated with this
kind of problem
can be thought
equivalently as the superposition of two
problems.
One is simply blocked pressure plus
radiation as if the panel is moving.
And this is so simple because that is just
the
two times of the incident wave, and this is
the radiation.
So if you think carefully, for noise
control
purpose you do not want to have
degradation due to the power.
