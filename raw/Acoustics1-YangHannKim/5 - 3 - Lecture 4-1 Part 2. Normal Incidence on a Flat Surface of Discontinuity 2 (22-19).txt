What is the next job?
Because our objective is to find out two,
find out
the reflection and transmission
coefficient we need two equation.
Very simple mathematical conclusion.
And these two equations has to come from
here.
This boundary condition or discontinuity
condition.
Okay.
And x equals 0 we can see that
velocity must be continuous,
and because there is no mass at 
discontinuity.
There just, just two fluids are separated
by I mean it's a simple discontinuity.
Therefore I can say.
pressure
must be
continuous.
If I write this physical
requirement in terms of mathematical form, I can
write this.
Velocity.
What is the velocity?
Of medium one?
So one is velocity induced by the incident
wave.
That is Pi divided by Z1.
Because, we assume the plane wave.
If it is not plane wave, we cannot write,
we cannot use this.
Okay?
And then, velocity due to reflected wave,
look like that.
And because we assume the velocity of
incident wave of this direction.
And the velocity of, due to reflected wave
that direction, we have to put the minus
sign over here
That
is the total velocity induced by,
instant as well as reflected wave.
And that has to be equal to the velocity
of transmitted wave, which is.
Pt over Z2.
So we have equation one.
Number 1.
Right?
And actually I, we omitted over here, all
exponential j omega t.
In
other words, this equality has to be hold for
any instance of time, any frequency.
Now, what about
pressure? pressure at media one is Pi and
Pr is composed of two pressure.
And the
Pi properating this way, so if I say this
is.
Plus, then I have to put the minus.
And that has to be equal to Pt.
Is it correct?
Is it correct?
No. Because pressure is a scalar.
And the pressure by definition is acting
on the surface normal direction.
Therefore the pressure at medium one is Pi
plus Pr, okay?
Now, let's say this is equation two.
And then we have to find out the
reflection
coefficient and transmission coefficient
from these two equations okay.
And everybody can do it.
And how, maybe one simple way to do it is
maybe I divide this Z1,
Z1 and Z2 then add up, then this will go
away.
And then I, no, no, no this will go away.
And I have two Pi over Z1 is equal
to Pt, no this has to be Z1,
one over Z1 plus 1 over Z2.
So I can get Pt over Pi is equal
to Z1 plus Z2, 2Z1.
Actually I, I remember, I didn't try.
So derivation is rather straight forward
as everyone can do it.
So let me go back to the results.
So from, I say from equations
one and two we obtained, the reflection
equation is.
Z1 plus Z2, Z1
minus Z2 and transmission coefficient is
equal to Z1 plus Z2 and 
2Z1, which is, as I said before.
Exactly same as
what we have over here.
The
only difference is this Z1 is equal to
rho L c1.
And this Z2 is equal to rho L c2,
and this Z1 is equal to rho1 c1,
and this Z2 is equal to rho2 c2.
Why this is the same?
Because both cases are one dimensional
cases.
Alright.
Now, let's look at more about this.
Okay.
Special cases.
It's
always nice to look at
the rather complicated mathematical form.
In more, I mean in simpler cases.
How do we do it?
By generally looking at extreme cases,
often provides very intuitive physical
understanding.
So what if Z1 is much much smaller than
Z2.
Because Z1 is much, much more smaller than
Z2, then reflection coefficient
Z1 is much, much smaller than Z2.
Meaning that if z1 is $1 and z2 is $1
million.
Then, this one is 1 minus $1 million plus
$1 and it.
Denominator is $1 million and $1 so that
approximately what?
Minus one.
What about the transmission coefficient?
[SOUND].
Tranmission coefficient. Z1 is 1 dollar so 2
multiplied
by $1 is $2 divide by 1 million $1 that is
0.
What does it mean?
If Z1 is very small compared to Z2, this
is the case we shout
in air.
We want to hear what is transmitted in
water.
Okay.
Mathematical derivation shows that.
The fish cannot hear our song.
Therefore, when you fish,
when you enjoy fishing, you are allowed to
play music, because it does not,
the wave is not transmitted.

But discontinuity produce reflection
coefficient of minus 1.
What it means?
Total reflection?
Okay, let's see another case, two.
Z1 is very very large Z2.
Then, what is it?
R, now Z1 is very large, then R equal 1
and what about the tau?
Because z1 is very very large, tau
equal 2.
That means, if fish has a party under
water then we can hear.

Because tau is two.
When fish say, let's have a fun, then what
we hear is, let's have a fun.
Okay.
Hearing.
Hearing.
I mean, hearing.
Has to do with not only pressure but also
with velocity.
And here it means that my sensation has to
be
activated and that means, we need some
power, not only pressure.
Right.
For example in electrical engineering I
mean if you,
if you have a shock, an electric shock, I
mean not only high voltage
is necessary, but also high current.
That provide enough power.
So we have to see the power.
So what about the power reflection and the
power transmission equation has to be?
That we have to find out. How to get the
power transmission coefficient.
Power transmission coefficient is the ratio
between incident velocity
and the incident, the ratio between incident
power and
transmitted power or reflected power.
That is simply multiply this pressure
reflection coefficient with the velocity
reflection coefficient.
And velocity reflection coefficient is
simply
this one.
This is reflected wave.
This one divided by Z1 and this 1 divided
Z1.
Alright?
Because we are handling plane wave, the
velocity is pressure divided by z 1.
Therefore, what we obtain from this
calculation.
We obtain that, okay, this is the velocity
due to incident wave.
And this is the velocity due to reflected
wave.
Right?
So.
Reflection coefficient
due to velocity, I will say velocity, has
to be equal to the
velocity at medium 1.
No,
the velocity at medium 1 due to
reflection,
reflection divided by velocity at medium
one due to incident.
That is correct.
The velocity due to reflection, I can
write that is Pr
divided by z1 and the velocity due to
incident, that is Pi divided by Z1.
Okay?
That is the reflection coefficient of
velocity.
So I have to multiply this one to here.
Not just to divide both terms by Z1, okay?
So if I multiply this one, this one, to
there.
What I will obtain is, let me move my
blackboard over here.
So the power transmission coefficient has
to be Z1 minus Z2 over Z1 plus Z2.
So this is velocity transmission coefficient.
And compare with the velocity trans, the
power.
Velocity transmission coefficient, and I have
to multiply this one to there.
That will produce,
Z1 minus Z2.
Divided by Z1, plus Z2
does it produces Z1 minus Z2 square
divided by Z1 plus Z2 square.
The power, transmitted power, has to be.
Pressure multiplied by velocity conjugate.
Okay, we, as we, as we studied it
yesterday.
As we studied it yesterday.
So what we obtain would be
Z1 plus Z2, Z1 minus Z2 conjugate
multiplied by Z1 plus Z2, Z1 minus Z2.
That's the reflection, reflected power.
And the transmitted power will be
the transmitted velocity that would be
Pt divided by Z2.
That give the transmission coefficient would
be 2Z2 divided by Z1 plus Z2.
Therefore what I would get for the
transmission coefficient, power
transmission coefficient, which is P
multiplied U-conjugate would
be this one multiplied by the conjugate
2Z2, Z1 plus Z2.
That
gives me the picture you can see in the,

in our, in our book.
So, as I, said, we have a pressure
continuity at x equal zero.
That look like that.
And a velocity continuity that look like
that.
The reason why we have a minus over here,
is because the reflection, the
direction of, of velocity, due to
reflection has to be
opposite sign that compare with the
incident wave.
Okay?
And then we assume three different waves.
As I said because those two are right
going wave.
We put the minus sign over there.
And, as I explained the omega has to be
same, but
because we have two different medium, the
wave number can be different.
In other words, the, the number of waves
per
unit length would be different.
Even though we have the same frequency.
And, the boundary condition,
for velocity boundary condition we can
rewrite this
as we explained before.
Therefore, we got reflection coefficient
and this is transmission coefficient.
And we discussed this with a special case
but the velocity reflection coefficient.
Looks like that.
And the power reflection coefficient turns
out to be like
that.
Therefore, therefore even if the Z, Z0
is very very smaller than Z1.
Which is, I said the fish has a
party, and we are, we are trying to
listen their noise.
That is the case.
Z0 is much, much, much smaller than Z1.
Then the transmission coefficient
over here says that Z1 is much, much
smaller than z0.
We can not hear fish parting noise.
And also if Z0 is very, very large
compared to the Z1.
Still, fish cannot hear our voice.
Alright?
But if you have a rather different
experience.
If you, if you go to the swimming pool.
Sometimes, you can hear the sound outside
of
your water when, when you jump into the
water.
That often you can hear the sound coming
from some areas beyond the wall of water.
Why, it's because the sound excites
somehow in very small amounts the wall of
a swimming pool.
Therefore the wall of excited water
therefore you can hear it.
This model assumes that we have infinite
water and infinite air, therefore, the
predicted one is somehow different what we
normally can experience in swimming pool.
Okay, maybe you go swimming pool with your
friend
and ask your friend to make a aplause, big
aplause,
over the surface of water, and you, you,
you, go down
and then you cannot hear the sound coming
from above water.
Okay.
This means highlight of this derivation,
reflection and transmission.
Is dominated by, the characteristic
impedance
of a medium.
