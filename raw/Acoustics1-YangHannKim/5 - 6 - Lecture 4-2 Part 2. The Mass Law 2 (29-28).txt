Now,
we have surface of discontinuity which is,
can be regarded
as a limp wall, and we have, two
medium.
Okay, now we have limp wall, that has a
mass
per unit area m, m is mass per unit area.
And I
have a medium Z0 over here and a medium Z1
over here.
Okay, I have  wave Pi,
that can be expressed as complex amplitude
Pi.
An exponential minus j, omega t minus k0 x,
and I have reflected wave which I
denote pr x t and that I can write capital Pr,
that is complex amplitude and
exponential minus j, sorry about
this, omega t minus k0 x, and minus?
No, that has to be plus because it is
going
to the negative x axis, and then
there would be transmitted wave, that is
also function of x and t, that is capital
P, capital, the complex
pressure exponential minus j omega t minus
kx.
This is okay, because the transmitted wave
will propagate along the positive x axis.
But,
this k has to be
in this different case, has to be k1,
because k0 and one has to be omega over c0
or 1.
And omega has to be same in these
two media, because we are handling linear
acoustics.
In linear acoustics, if I shake
this one by a certain frequency, then what
you will hear or the response has to be
same excitation frequency.
Alright, that's good.
And,
as you note over there the boundary
condition.
Now, let's look at as
the boundary conditions, as the conditions
that give you the solution.
Okay?
Boundary determine the ratio between
incident and reflected.
The ratio between transmitted and, and
incident, and that concept
holds for every discontinuity case.
So that's why I am using this example, and
rather,
you know, deep sense
because of this will provide solid
foundation
to understand what's going to happen in
every discontinuity case.
Now, first boundary condition,
what would be?
I will use a different chalk, okay first,

First of all what would be?
Force?
Force balance, okay.
Force balance must be, achieved, between
these two media.
So I can say, Pi plus Pr, at x equals 0
minus pt at x equal zero, that is
the force acting upon this
limp wall per unit area okay.
The reason why, why I put minus is because
I am taking positive sign over here,
and a pressure by definition is acting
normal to the surface.
Therefore, I put plus sign over in here,
even if the
reflected wave is propagating toward this
distraction, that, that, that does not
necessarily mean that the, the pressure of
reflected waves acting
in this direction, it has to act upon the
surface in normal direction.
Okay, that's very, fundamental concept,
but often, I can see a lot of
mistake, because of the this understanding
of the definition of pressure.
Okay, that has to be equal to what?
Newton said if you have
unbalanced force the mass will move.
So, mass times acceleration.
What is the mass in this case?
That is m, per unit area, because we are
handling per unit area force.
That is m times acceleration that is y
double dot.
And what is y double dot?
Note that, y double dot is y
exponential, minus j omega t double dot.
So, I got minus j omega t, minus j omega
t.
Therefore, I get minus omega square, okay?
And y exponential minus j omega t.
That's what I have, and all this term also
has for example, Pi exponential minus j
omega t
Because I am looking at the pressure at x
equals 0.
This term will move away.
So I got,
removing all the exponential j omega t
term, I got Pi complex
plus Pr complex, minus Pt complex,
that equal to minus omega square m Y.
That's the first equation I have.
And you can see this equation in the text, too.
I want the students follow
the derivation because the reason why I am
doing derivation is
because by doing the derivation you can
observe how
the physics is a following, how the
physics is following into your derivation.
Derivation is just not mathematical
practice, derivation
is very effective demonstration of
managing the physics.
Okay.
So this is the first question I, I I can
note this is equation number one.
And
the second equation,
that I can get, from what?
So
the second equation.
Not only force balance is required but
also
kinematic relation has to be imposed on
this problem.
What do you see?
Velocity continuity, on x equals 0 plus
as well as 0 minus.
That means I am assuming the thickness
of limb wall is very very small with
respect to wavelength lambda.
So this theory can not be applied, for the
case of which the
thickness of limb wall is very large
compared with the wavelength,
So that is one limitation.And another
limitation is.
Is the case when the wave is incidnet to
the surface normal to the flat surface of
discontinuity.
Hey, but then the result we will obtain
from this.
Special case is useless is too special.
No I don't think so because in general
case, for
example I have this kind of incident wave and
I
can decompose this incident wave into
these two components.
And the transmission loss for example due
to this incident wave is,
very small because we assume that the
fluid we are handling has no viscosity.
Therefore, no problem.
What you obtain, really, the major
primary, part, that dominate,
dominate the physics of this kind of
flat, flat surface of discontinuity.
Okay let's go back to velocity continuity
case.
What is the velocity, of the fluid
particle over here?
Let's say this is the fluid particle we
are considering.
Velocity due to incident wave will be Pi over
Z0, because we assume plane wave.
And what about the velocity due to
reflected wave? That is Pr over Z0
and minus because the velocity is a vector
quantity and a velocity due to reflected
is approaching this way.
And that has to be equal to, the velocity
of limp wall over here.
And what is it?
That is Y dot and Y dot is Y
and minus j omega, exponential minus j
omega t.
Therefore, magnitude of the velocity of
limp wall is minus j omega Y.
Y is the complex amplitude.
And that is the velocity on x equal 0
minus, 0 minus means
this is 0 and this is 0 minus, right,
right before 0.
And I want to apply the velocity continuity at
zero plus,
which I can say the velocity due to
transmitted wave is
Pt over now, Z1 and has to be equal to
minus j omega
Y.
Okay?
I have, how many equation I have?
I have, this is, equation, two, sorry this
is.
This is equation two and this equation
three.
Now I have one, two, three equation and I
would like to have.
For example, Pt over Pi, which is
transmission coefficient, and what is this?
Okay?
How to get it.
Let's do it, let's do it because this is
the case, which is different with what we
have.
Z0 and Z1 we have, okay?
So, we have to eliminate a Pr to get the
relation between Pi and Pt.
How to eliminate a Pr?
Okay, what I can do is.
I will just,
divide the first equation by Z0.
Then I will have minus omega square m Y
over Z0.
That's called, that is equation four.
Then I will add equation four to equation
two, to eliminate Pr.
What, what we will have, can you, can you
give me some hint?
Okay, what we will have is.
Okay, I have a Pi over Z0 and I have a Pi
over Z0, so I have two Pi over Z0.
And I have a plus Pr over Z0 and I
have minus Pr over Z0, so those two terms
cancel out.
And I have over here, minus Pt over
Z0 I have
now this one minus omega square m Y Z0.
And I have what?
Minus j omega Y, that's what I have. Okay?
That's correct.
Now, you have a relation Pi and Pt, but
still
there is the another one which I want to
eliminate.
That is Y.
So once eliminate Y, and express Y in
terms of Pi and Pt.
Okay did I do to it?
Oh, there's another equation, okey?
So invite equation three that express the
relation between Y and Pt.
Okay, j omega y has to be, according to
equation three.
I will write down equation three over
there.
Has to be Pt over Z1.
And
then what about this one?
This is a headache right?
This is a headache.
But I can see simply, minus omega square m Y,
Iis what?
I mean, what we
can do is, we will substitute this Y over
here.
Over there.
I am using equation three again.
Why is Pt over Z1
and I have to divided this one over minus
j omega.
Okay.
That's what I obtained.
Looks not bad, because I can see that this
term will change to
because j omega minus omega square divide
by j omega give me.
j omega, right?
Where?
Over here, right?
Hun?
So, you got prize.
Where is my wallet?
So I will give you later after the
lecture.
So minus and minus go away and one divided
by j give j omega.
Okay?
And then, I have m, and then I have Z0.
[SOUND] And a z1, [SOUND] and I have a pt.
Wow, this is nice, this is nice.
And I put, this one.

Over here.
Then, I got following relation.
So,
what it, what I obtain is 2 Pi over Z0
minus Pt over Z0.
That is equal to
the first term is this,
minus j omega m, over Z0
over Z1 Z0 Z1, Pt and then
I have a second term that is
simply plus Pt over Z1.
So, what we obtain now is there is a Pi,
and there is a
Pt and a Pt and a Pt so, lets summarize
what it means.
Okay I have, Pt looks very complicated and
Pi so lets write down what's Pt over Pi?
Okay there.
And the Pi is simply 2 over Z 0.
And the Pt, I have many interesting
component, okay?
Pt, this one go over there, then I have 1
over Z0 plus 1 over Z1.
And I have minus j omega m over Z0
Z1 therefore if I multiply Z0 Z1
then I will have two Z1 over there.
And then I have minus j omega m plus Z1
plus Z0.
And this is very interesting.
Okay.
Okay, this three term, is very
interesting.As well as this term.
So let's go back what we have?
For the case of, when
we have just two mediums Z0 and Z1.
At that time, the tau, was Z1
plus Z0 and I have over there 2Z1.
Alright, reason, let's look at this
carefully.
Try to com-, try to relate
this mathematical expression with physics,
okay.
This term expresses sort of,
sort of averaged impedance.
And this is how expresses the impedance of
transmitted medium.
So keeping that in your mind, then this is
same
But this is two times the impedance of a
transmitted medium.
That is 2Z1,
And this is Z1 plus Z0 because we have two
mediums, Z1 plus Z0.
And also we have additional term that is
proportional to minus j omega m.
That is the highlight
of physics that happens when we have

Alright?
What this is minus j omega m?
What is this?

What is the dimension of this?
Dimension of this has to be equivalent with
the dimension of that, is impedance.
So this is another form of impedent that
represent dynamics of limp wall.
So that is very interesting.
That is tau.
So tau proportional to
medium, related to the medium, as well as,
tau is it strangely related with the mass
and the omega of the limp wall,
right.
The reason why it has minus j of j, why?
1, 1 divide minus j is
j.
So that means,
it has phase difference between incident
and transmitted wave.
Okay?
So if you look at the magnitude square
of this term, transmission,
power transmission coefficient, then we
can come up with what?
How much power
will be transmitted.

That will be related with.
Anyway this one has to omega m square
plus
magnitude the square of this one and this
one
so if Z1 and Z0 for the case of
air and
water that should be rho0 c0 and rho1 c1
has
on a real path so I can argue that this
one would be
Z1 square plus Z0 square and 4Z1 square.
Okay that's the power transmission
coefficient.
So if I look at the log of ten,
1 over tau magnitude square and
ten call this, transmission loss.
What is it?
This transmission loss,

another representative measure that
describes
the measure, the performance of limp wall.
The
reason why I use inverse of one of tau
square is because if I am, if I have
large tao, that means I have more large
transmission.
That often we do not want to have larger
transmission.
We often have, as a noise control
engineer, we often want to have a
small tau, maybe we want to have a zero
tau,
So if I measure like that
in dB scale,
that is the transmission losses I obtained
by using the limp wall.
So if I have 10 dB
RTL 10 dB RTL, that
means, my wall reduce
the noise 10 dB.
So suppose here I have a 100 dB.
And I designed a wall that give me
at certain frequency, 30 dB
transmission loss,
then I have I expect to have, 70 dB over
there.
In other words, I am successful to reduce
noises 30 dB.
So, transmission loss, sometimes this is
called transmission loss.
That is very useful measure or index
that normally used for noise control
engineering.
Okay,
so this is interesting.
