Let's move, let's use our
power point from now on.
Okay, as I said, there is two component,
one is propagating in x direction,
The other one is propagating in negative x
direction and this is the assumed.
wave propagating in string number two.
And
then, as I said.
The velocity in y direction has to be
same
there is a, a boundary condition, as I
explained.
There is a velocity.
on the string number one, has to be the
same as the velocity in string number two.
Okay, force acting on string number one in
y direction, this is the
force acting string number one and this is
the force acting on string number two.
Okay?
There is no mass between string number one
and string number two, therefore this term
is zero.
Alright?
And, we can say that at string number one,
there is wave propagating.
In x direction that is g1.
And note that I changed,
to observe wave in terms of time.
Instead, instead of space.
This is a little bit tricky but this is
better, this is convenient.
Okay, this is propa, the wave propagating
and, and positive x-axis,
but I am observing the wave with 
respect to time.
And this is the wave propagating in
negative x-direction.
Alright?
Observing the wave in time.
And this is the wave, at string number
two, again that is the wave propagating
in positive x direction.
Okay, then putting this assumed wave to
this boundary condition.
Then I, I obtain the following
okay, yeah.
Thank you.
Okay, the following equation.
So, the velocity.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Velocity in y direction, that has to be dy1,
dt at x equals 0.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
If I operated that, that will be g1 prime
plus
gh1 prime, and x equals 0, velocity in y
direction.
And x 0 plus that means the velocity of a
string number
two, can be written like that, and these
has to be the same,
because of the kinematic boundary
condition, and
this is forced boundary condition, and
then,
this will bring us this equation.
There's TL over c1, g1 prime.
That is a force acting on string number
one, due
to the propagating wave in x direction, in
positive x direction.
This is a force.
Due to the propagating wave, but in
negative x direction, TL over c1.
Okay?
And this is the force acting on string
number two
in y direction, and TL over c2 and g2
prime.
Okay?
Next.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So this is the the expression, that says
the
velocity in y direction at, at, at, 
discontinuity has to be same,
this is the force boundary condition at,
at discontinuity.
And this reviews that the following
says, okay?
The force in y direction and velocity y
direction, will be TL over c.
Okay?
This can be obtained very simply, you plot
fy which is
derived before, and uy which is expressed
before,
and divide that, fy and uy, you will get
TL over
c, that means, force over velocity is TL
over c.
This is impedance, of sting.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So how much force will be exerted for a
given or unit velocity.
As a new measure, and that, we call
impedance.
And that impedance is related with two
different physical measures.
One is the string, the tension along
string.
And the other one is speed of propagation.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay.
That is Z1 and Z2.
Z1 is TL over c1, and Z2 is a TL over c2.
And how much transmitted, and how much
reflected is totally determined by
the characteristic impedance of string,
which I said TL over c1 for Z1.
And the other one is TL over c2, there is
a Z2.
Okay?
So, what I am arguing at the moment, is
the reflection
coefficient is totally determined by the
characteristic impedance of a string.
And transmission coefficient is totally
depends on.
Again, the characteristic impedance of a
string.
Okay, this is very exciting.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Another one, is to look at the string
dynamics.
And this is the force acting on, the
string, and this is the angle theta and
the
angle will be changed if you use, 
Tayler expansion, and that has to move like that.
As I explained before.
And the derivation show that, using this
assumption,
the angle is small, therefore I can
approximate
the sign theta to theta, and the cosign
theta is one
that we will get this
approximation.
As I said before, ds can be approximated
by dx because dydx is small.
Famous linearization, and the
square of
a small quantity is much, much small.
Okay, like will have 0.01 and if you
square that,
that would be 10 to the minus 4.
So, very small.
And also we can write the small change of
tension dTL.
Like this again Tayler expansion and the, then we
will have the wave equation.
And it is very interesting that this is
the wave equation we obtained before,
and this is the wave equation we got by
considering the small element of string.
As a conclusion we can say that c square
which is the
speed of wave propagation of string, is
equal to TL over rho_L, that is
interesting.
That means if you have, can you come up?
can, you can come up, can you come up?
Yeah?
The speed of propagation.
The string, yeah.
Speed of propagation of a string.
Okay.
Speed of provisional a string.
You can see the proposition right now.
Can you see
it?
Okay, now you see the speed of
propagation, okay, if I, If I push
harder, so that, that, I am increasing
the tension, then speed of propagation
increase, okay?
If I make a small TL then speed
of propagation [SOUND] is like that.
Don't, don't lose this string, that, the
string will come and hit me.
Okay?
Very careful.
So I push, so I am increasing TL, it's
dangerous.
As you can see, the string of the speed
of propagation is large, okay.
Maybe I will increase rho_L okay?
I increase the rho_L twice, and according
to this formulation, I increase rho_L
twice, okay?
Then, okay.
Could I have one of this.
Okay.
No, no we have to, we, we have to, we
have to keep our TL as before, okay?
Okay, you feel TL, and then decrease
rho_L, you, you, no, no give me this.
No, no you have to keep it here okay,
that's okay.
I can feel
it.
Is increased, right?
So this demonstrate that c square L is
proportional.
Okay, thank you very much, thank you very
much for not hitting me by, by the
uh,string.
So, interesting that speed of propagation
thus depends on the
mass per unit length of a string, and the
tension.
Well, that is interesting, right?
So you have a medium, the TL is, is the
tension
per unit length, increasing TL means,
I am having harder medium, okay?
Then speed of propagation will increase,
okay?
If I have a softer medium, that means TL
is reduced, then the speed of propagation
is reduced.
If I have more, I mean rho_L that means I
have a medium that has
a mass, more mass than I have to, I have
to oscillate.
Then the speed of propagation of medium is
decreased.
So that is very interesting, and that is
the speed of propagation.
Okay?
Now, let us move on another physics of a
string.
So Z is a TL over c.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And because of c s square is a TL over
rho using that, we can find the specific
impedance of a string, is simply rho_L
cs.
Okay, rho c, rho c.
The specific impedance of medium is rho c.
Wow, that's great.
That is great.
Let's see how, why this is great, later
on.
OKay?
So remember, first, how much is reflected?
How much is transmitted?
Depends on the characteristic impedance of
string, that is rho_L c.
Okay?
And the speed of propagation of the
string,
inversely proportional to density per
unit,
density per unit length, and proportional
to TL.
Okay?
That's the two key things you have to
understand.
Alright, next, let's move on.
Driving point impedance, which is a new
concept.
Suppose I am oscillating the string at the
one point,
okay.
Let's invite another assistant,
okay?
He's invited because, not because he is
most
handsome boy, but because he, he, he, he
had a military service, and and a marine
[LAUGH] in Korean Hae-Byung-Dae so, I believe
him, he
can, he can assist me very well, okay?
So, how much reflected and transmitted
does
depend on characteristic of impedance of
medium?
Well, the impedance represents the ratio
between force and velocity.
When I oscillate, here I am, I am exciting
the force this
medium, and there's also, I do experience
the velocity, so
I want to investigate how much, I mean,
what's the impedance
at this point, that I call driving point
impedance?
Okay?
Okay here is, I feel the force and the
velocity over there, at some frequency
I've got the, the, the, the velocity and,
and the force I'm experience is,
does depend on of course, the frequency,
right?
And I want to see the more detail.
So,
suppose that I am exciting the system with
the frequency omega, and a magnitude f.
Okay?
