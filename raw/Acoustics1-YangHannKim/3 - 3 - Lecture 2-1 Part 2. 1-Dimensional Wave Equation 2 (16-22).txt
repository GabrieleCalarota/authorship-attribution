Linearized Euler equation.
I think I can use this one, right?
Linearization means that, this is fairly
large
compared with rho prime, this is also
fairly large
compared with rho prime, p prime, so plug
that
part into there, then I have d dx p0 plus
p prime.
That is to be equal to rho zero plus rho
prime, and I have meterial derivative,
udt, so I have du prime dt plus u prime du
prime dx.
[SOUND] Okay, u prime is a small quantity
and du
prime dx is, seeing the small comp,
quant, small quant, quantity with respect
to change of the x
Therefore this is a small compared with
that, so I am, I am neglecting this.
So I have here rho zero prime,rho prime, du prime 
dx and this one is a small one and this
one is also small one.
Small one multiply, small one is very
small
one compared with rho zero prime du prime
dt.
So, in this right hand side I only have
rho zero
du prime dt, that has, to be equal
to I have d rho prime ds, rho d
prime sorry d, d, p prime dx.
So,
and usually the ambient pressure is
constant.
There is slow fluctuation with respect to
dx compared with that.
Therefore, in this case, dp prime, ds, ds
is a
larger value than dp zero with respect
to dx.
Therefore I have.
The p prime, dx minus.
This what we call linearized Euler
equation.
Okay, physical meaning of this Euler
equation, what it means.
So, one dimensional Euler
equation, of course, linearized.
What it means by linearized?
Physically.
Small pressure, okay.
Later on we will talk about the limitation
of the linear wave equation.
Okay.
[SOUND]
This is one kilohertz and about 60dB, you can
measure it.
And we didn't learn about the dB scale,
but surprisingly, later on
we will found that this linearised Euler
equation is
valid up to 120 decibel.
And 120 decibel, or 110 decibel is a
fairly large, acoustic pressure.
So because we linearize this acoustic wave
equation valid only
for, the acoustic pressure up to 120
decibel.
Okay, I rewrite linearized acoustic
linearized Euler equation and minus dp prime
dx
means I am looking for the pressure change
in a small,
I mean small change in, in, in x
direction.
So this is unbalanced pressure, in other
words, that will induce
the fluid particle to rho0 du dt, that
is acceleration.
So, again, this is, this is The Newton's
second law for the compressible fluid.
And also another interesting part is this.
So that means, that means, if I measure
the fluid of particle
pressure using two microphone with the
certain distance delta x.
Okay, it's p1 and p2.
This means that p2 minus p1 over delta x
Okay?
I measure it.
And that, that is rho0, du/dt.
Therefore I divide this one by rho0.
Then I, I have du/dt.
Right?
So, what I can do is if I integrated this
part
with the respect of time then I can obtain
gradient of dp dx, okay?
Therefore I can measure pressure, based on
pressure measurement, I can estimate the
velocity.
So I can, I can, I can measure velocity
based on pressure, based on Euler,
linearized Euler equation, okay?
So every intensity probe, use this Euler
equation to measure intensity.
Because intensity we will learn later on,
intensity is, defined p times velocity,
Okay?
So linearized, Euler equation is
providing the intensity measurement.
All right.
So we got the relation between p prime and u.
Let's consider, let's try to have the relation
of
u and rho prime or u and the, u and, u
and, and, and, and, and,
okay, velocity and density change.
Okay, we are attempting to look at
the relation between velocity and density
change.
Again let's go back to this famous bottle.
Okay.
I'm trying to suppose I have a piston
on the neck there, and I'm trying to
push the, the air contained in this
bottle.
Using piston, then you will see that the
density will be changed, all right.
Density will be changed.

89 
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:41,170
So let's consider again small segment of
pipe, one dimensional pipe.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
If I, if I, if I supply some density, with
certain the velocity rho u.
Then there will be some density change.
Mathematically simple, use the Taylor
expansion.
Or physically I say if there's a some density supply
into this volume, then there will be some
density change.
On this surface, that would be d rho u
plus d rho u dx, dx.
Okay, if it, if it is, is not easy to
understand, then suppose this is a bank.
And, this is money.
Okay?
You supply one million dollars at a
certain time over
here, and at this bank give some money to
other people to get some interest.
Say, one million dollars plus
one thousand dollar.
Then they should be a change in the benk
account.
That I can express that is
if this is delta x then I can say delta x
times s, that is the
volume okay, rho.
So I said, the change of the bank account,
d rho s dx dt,
okay, if it is positive.
Then I have more income than the loan.
So, I would say the rho u d rho u divided by
dx, dx multiplied by S.
Okay, that's what I, the, amount of money
I
give you, somebody else, and then minus rho
u s.
This is called conservation of mass.
[SOUND]
Something wrong here?
Sign has changed, this one can be over
there.
Why?
Because this is the net increase of the
bank
account together that increase I have to get
more income.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Oh, oh, oh oh, sorry.
[LAUGH]
U hooo.
So that is plus.
That is minus, and this is a plus.
Okay?
Thank you very much.
And I will
summarize what I expressed based on
physical observation.
Now this will go away.
And I have this and I have that one.
So, I have d rho s, dt delta x.
That has to be equal to minus d rho u dx,
dx.
And this is the same so I eliminate.
I got.
Where's s?
There should be S too, so eliminate S,
then d rho dt.
has to be equal balanced by d rho u dx.
Okay, that's mass balance equation.
So if I, if I rewrite that equation
somewhere over here.
I will rewrite over here.
Then
I have equation.
saying that d rho dt has to be balanced by
minus d rho dx.
Physical meaning is that rate of change of
density

in this small volume has to be balanced
by
mass flux through two surfaces.
Okay?
So mass flux is the money I got from
customer, the money I
give to the customer to get interest.
Okay-
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And then, then linerize.
Linerize means that density has two
components one is rho zero
and rho prime and then velocity is
expressed u prime, then what do I got.
d rho zero dt has to be zero
and I have d rho prime dt has
to be balanced by minus
d rho zero rho prime and u.
dx and then as I said before small one
multiply small one is a very small one,
so I have minus rho zero du prime dx.
Okay, this is conservation of mass.
Simply saying that the rate of change of,
the, rate of increase of
mass in a unit volume has to be balanced
by mass flux.
Okay?
Again, this means that if I measure the
velocity at certain position x one.
And another position that is separated by
delta x.
Then I, I can estimate the change, density
change.
That is interesting, so I will write over
here this is the relation between,
density and velocity,
so if I got the if I got the relation
between density and pressure.
Then I have completed the description
between pressure, density, and velocity.
