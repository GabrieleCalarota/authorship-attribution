[SOUND] Let's
consider a very simple
vibratory system.
That has a mass and spring constant K,
which is linear of spring constant.
And then [SOUND] damping linear damping
that has the
damping coefficient of C.
And then suppose we measure the motion of
this mass by using this
coordinate [SOUND] of course that is
oscillating with respect to time.
And then [SOUND] suppose we apply the
force,
f of t, the general force then well known
governing equation.
In other words that governs the motion of
this kind of vibratory to a system can be
written as [SOUND].
Simply means that due to this excitation
the single degree of a vibratory system
with response response and it can be
measured by the displacement of F of t.
Of course the F of t [SOUND] can be
expressed as the sum of sines and cosines.
[SOUND]
[SOUND]
Sorry.
Sum of sine and cosine.
Obviously the sine and cosine has the,
phase difference of 90 degree or pi over 2.
And note also that [SOUND]
the
relation between the
[SOUND]
between F of t and
x of t is linear.
[SOUND]
In other words if I excite a system twice
of the force
then the response will be the twice and
that's the meaning of a linear system.
Therefore, if we understand how the system
is, is
going to respond due to sine omega
1t
over general sine of omega t, then using
principle of a super
position, we can generalize how the, the
system will
respond due to sin omega 1 or omega 2,
omega nt.
Therefore, [SOUND]
we usually study
the following case [SOUND]
that
is governed by the following following
equation and let's go with the plus CX
dash plus kx is equal to for example
C sine [SOUND]
omega t.
Then the solution x of t [SOUND]
can be sine omega t because we are
[UNKNOWN]
will be omega, frequency of omega, the
response
has to be the omega also because we are
handling again the linear system.
Also there will be some components of co,
cosine omega
t because there is x double dot and x dot.
As you can see here even if you excite a
system to the
sine omega t the response can be cosine or
sine or in between.
So we can assume that the response xt
would be some contribution of sin omega t
and
some contribution of cosine omega t, and
say this is
A and the contribution of cosine ability
is B.
Then of course that can be written as
square root
A plus Square root of B squared and the
sine omega t plus 5.
And the phi is the phase angle.
Of course tangent phi would be the ratio
between A and B.
So even if we excite a system with a
sine
omega t, the response will be sine omega
t, plus phi.
Phi is the phase difference between force
and response in other
words, this two terms
actually expresses that when the entire
system with
a sin omega t, the response will be
response, will be responded
by same omega has certain phase difference.
Okay, that's the one way to mathematically
solve this equation.
As you can see here, in this manipulation.
We have to handle sine and o, sine and
cosine at the same time.
What would be the more convenient way to
handle this problem?
Okay.
Observing that.
Observing that a sine is c sine
omega t can be represent as
the imagine c sine omega t can
be represented by some [SOUND]
magnitude of F exponential J omega
T Imaginary part.
Because F exponential to the J omega T
Is simply
the magnitude f multiplied by cosine omega
t plus
t and then magnitude f multiplied by sin
omega t.
So if I take imaginary part of this, that
is, is
the, same as F exponential j sorry, f
cosine,
no sine omega t, [SOUND] and magnitude and
j so if I take
it, imaginary part, that would be this
term.
So in other words, the c and f magnitude
is the same.
Okay, then.
[SOUND]
Suppose, I am taking, [SOUND] the whole
equation.
Mx double dot [SOUND] plus cx double dot,
[SOUND]
plus kx [SOUND] equals F exponential j
omega t
[SOUND] and we're taking an imaginary
part.
And this will be true.
And [COUGH] this will be somehow related
with [COUGH] this equation.
Okay.
That means,
if I get a solution that governs by mx
double dot cx dot
plus kx equal to f exponential plus j
omega t.
Get the solution x of t, then take a
imaginary part
then we will get the same solution as we
obtain by following this procedure.
assume that xt is composed
by.
It's a complex amplitude X.
This is complex force F of course, and
exponential j omega t, okay?
And then solve this equation by using this
assumed solution.
Then what we will get is the following.
[SOUND] Okay, taking, double
derivative with respect to pi
will give me minus omega square.
Minus omega square x, exclamation j omega
t m.
I have to put m over here.
And then take the derivative with respect
to time, will give
me plus J omega C and then X exponential J
omega T.
And then kx, exponential j omega t, that
has
to be equal to f exponential j omega t.
Therefore, we can write immediately the
following equation:
minus omega scale n, plus j omega c,
plus kx
equal to f because exponential g omega t
is a common factor.
What does it mean by this equation.
It is very interesting.
First, note that x, capital X and a
capital F are complex.
So lets invite complex plane.
Okay?
So this is imaginary axis and this is a
real axis.
Then x, because x is complex.
That has magnitude and phase.
So let's draw this is x.
And the kx is just, follow the same
direction
but different magnificate with a different
magnification of factor k.
So this would be kx.
Lets, lets wright down over here kx.
and what is j omega cx?
Okay, the magnitude would be omega cx but
there is a j factor
and note to that j is simply exponential j
pi over 2.
In other words, it has to rotate 90
degrees from this direction, okay?
So let's draw this J omega C component
over here.
Maybe I will use a different color.
So that is j omega cx.
That was essentially over here and what
about minus omega square m
and x and a minus 1 is equal to j
multiplied by j.
That means this one, essentially indicates
that, this
complex, magnitude has to rotate again 90
degree over here.
And that will be minus omega square m.
So I put this one over here, translate.
[SOUND]
Okay, and I say this is omega square mx.
And that has to be equal to F.
So that means, geometrically, that has to
be equal to F.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay?
So, that means
the phase difference between this excitation
force magnitude
complex F and then x face difference is
this.
This is a phi, okay?
And again by looking at this so-called
phasor diagram, we can anticipate, or we
can
feel rather dramatic physical meaning.
From this figure.
For example, if omega is increasing, then
the magnitude of this one, will
increase linear but this one, will
increase, in respect to omega scale.
Therefore, if this increase by 10, this
will increase by 100.
Therefore, I can see that the increase
like that induce increase
the one like that with the same f, f has
to be same.
Therefore the phase angle approach to.
As omega increase to 180 degrees.
And what if this one reduced and then
omega square.
Is reduced by omega therefore this will be
drastically reduce.
So therefore the face angle will approach
to 0.
In other words, that means in low
frequency, the phase difference between force
and
the displacement will be, will be
approaching to 0 but in very high
frequency.
The phase difference between force and
displacement, would be, 180 degree.
[INAUDIBLE] This is simple, [INAUDIBLE]
what, what, what, what
I when I excite the spring, with a
very low
frequency, suppose I am pushing, the, the
co, I mean
some spring with a very, very low
frequency, like this.
Then there will be no phase difference
between the force and the displacement.
But when I excite the single degree of
vibratory
system for example car and I drive a car
in a very rough road at a very high
speed then the excitation frequency will
increase very much.
Then what you will feel is like this kind
of of response.
That means the phase difference between
force and this placement is 180 degrees.
So using complex function for analyzing
this kind of
vibratory system rather provides very
dramatic and,
and, and, and tangible physical
understanding between
the force and displacement in terms of
phase.
Of course use, using this geometry you
can,
you can also get the transfer function
rather easily.
Because the square of this magnitude has to
be equal to
the square of this magnitude and the square
of this magnitude.
That will give you the so-called the
transfer function between force and, and
displacement.
As a conclusion you can see that the using
this complex
function for analyzing vibratory system
is convenient.
Because we don't have to you know, handle
and and,
handle between the sine and cosine that
has 90 degree phase difference.
As well as because we can use the phasor
we can see
more tangible physics that is
associated with the face between force and
displacement.
