This will be the lecture number two.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
[SOUND].
Today we will continue to talk about
wave propagation using one dimensional.
Wave.
And the lecture, lecture one and the
lecture two essentially
covers, what is written in in my text
[SOUND] chapter one.
Okay, in the last lecture, we learned
about, dispersion relation.
[SOUND] But essentially describes how the,
oscillation in space.
[SOUND] 2 pi is wave, wave number that is
2 pi k is wave number.
That is 2 pi over lambda.
So, and also omega, is a frequency
in radian [SOUND] so
if we express the omega in a, in frequency
in hertz,
Then, 2 pi over lambda is related with two
pi f over c, therefore.
We've got, the Lambda which is,
wavelengths in space is related with, the
frequency [SOUND]
like this.
So this, is a very exciting, and
meaningful.
And very representative equation that
relates
with, the space and time oscillation.
And I will I will show how, it
is actually related by demonstrating, a
simple experiment.
[SOUND] And I need some.
Volunteer from our students.
[SOUND] So, you volunteer because you
think you're most handsome boy?
[LAUGH] Okay, [INAUDIBLE] Okay, let me, go
up.
So everybody can see this?
Okay, that's, that's good.
Now,
okay what you can see now, is the
frequency as well as.
Wavelengths, or frequency, which is the
oscillation in time.
And you will see how the oscillation
in time, is related with oscillation in
space.
Okay.
I will, oscillate this, with a very, low
frequency.
I think that this is, about five hertz,
okay?
And you will see this big wavelengths.
And then if I, oscillated this, with a
rather small period of oscillation.
In other words, larger frequency.
Then, you will see more, you know, rapid,
fluctuation in space.
So, when I oscillate this, with higher,
higher
frequency, then you will see more, rapid
oscillation in space.
So, this demonstration essentially
exhibit, how
this, this dispersion relation is really
you know, happened in space.
Okay.
And then, in the last lecture, we, talked
about.
The wave equation, [SOUND] in two
different ways.
One is, I argued that, all the possible
[SOUND] one dimensional wave.
All the possible one dimensional wave, i,
is
composed by two components, one is, right
going wave.
[SOUND]
This is right going because, as 
time goes on the, function g will move,
in the right direction.
And also, [SOUND] another possible wave,
is the left going wave.
Okay.
And then we, showed that.
There's two waves, actually satisfy, the.
[SOUND].
One dimensional wave equation,
by differentiating twice of this
The wave, and I argue that this is the,
this
is the only possible wave that can exist
in one dimension.
And then, [SOUND] we didn't go detail, but
it is written in the text.
When we consider the, [SOUND]
forces acting on a small section of a
string.
String is the mechanical component that
can only transmit tension, okay?
Beam is the mechanical element that can
transmit, bending,
so because this string is the element that
can only transmit to string, not, allowing
bending transmission.
So, if it.
Push the string at one point, there must
be, a discontinuity in a slope.
Okay, [SOUND] say this is the tension,
acting on the string
and, [SOUND] say this is the
infinitesimal length of string.
Then, using Taylor Expansion.
We can, say the tension over here
would be, TL [SOUND] and dTL, ds.
Okay?
As you can see here, there is a force
unbalance.
Because of these two different tension,
this string will

move following the famous Newton’s
second law.
Okay, the Newton second law says, simply
the mass of this
small section of string
would move, with a
certain acceleration.
So, if I write what I said using the
mathematical expression, then I can say 
there will be a some,
Mass times acceleration in this
direction, and that is
rho_L multiplied by ds, and this is the total
mass of.
this element, and y double dot, [SOUND]
and y
double dot, y is the coordinate, in this
direction.
And x, is coordinate in that direction.
And I can write there is another, [SOUND]
acceleration component in x direction.
Therefore, the business we have to do is,
equate,
unbalanced force in this part, with, mass
times acceleration over there.
So, we can do that, because as you can see
here, there
is component in x direction, and there a
component in the y direction.
The component in x direction of a string,
the force acting on this small,
segment of element in x direction, has to
be equal to, rho_L ds x double dot.
X double dot is acceleration, in x
direction.
And then I can say, the force component in
y direction has to be, equal
to the rho_L, multiply ds y double
dot in y direction.
And the result.
Will give us, exactly same wave equation.
That is of course, d square y, d x square 
equal to 1 over c square.
d square y, d t square.
Assuming that, the motion in x direction.
Is very small, compared with the motion
in
y direction, that makes sense because the
string, as
we show demonstrated just before, is the
element
that is moving up and down in this
direction.
And of course, there is very small amount
of motion, in x direction, but that is,
small.
And we will show, the, how it is a small,
later on
by, you know, looking at some details that
is driving in the text.
And also, you can, approximate.
This ds is, of course, square root of
the
dx square and dy square, and the square
root of dx square
plus dy square, can be, you know, written
as, if I take out ds then
ds is dx square root 1 plus dy dx squared,
and dy
dx, is the slope of the string and we, we
assume
that the variation, I mean, variation of a
string's elevation with respect to x.
Is a small.
Therefore, dy dx square
is much more smaller than dy dx.
This is what we call, linearization.
So, by doing, well known, linearization,
we can obtain.
As wave equation.
So, as one of the students asked, in the
last lecture,
this, wave equation is as, is obtained, by
assuming, general one dimensional wave,
and then.
Looking at a detail of the behavior of
this general solution.
We obtain wave equation, and the other one
is, we look at the how the small element
of a string, will behave in space and time
by using, by apply, Newton's second law.
Upon the small, segment of element.
We obtain again, wave equation.
What does it mean?
First, this solution is complete.
Okay, second.
Depending on the boundary condition.
The shape of the solution will be
determined.
So, mathematically speaking, the business
we have, to find out all the solution,
is to solve this.
One dimensional wave equation.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Upon, or given, boundary condition.
That is a very, well-known, mathematical
problem.
And if you, remember the Sturm Liouville 
problem, you can, invite some,
some orthogonal set of solution.
And then, you can get the you can, you can
you can estimate the,
the weight of, orthogonal solution,
that satisfy the boundary condition.
And I will not go detail about that,
because that is, too mathematical.
And I'm sure everybody, in this case,
would,
remember [LAUGH] those boundary value program
at least.
Or, you can do it, it, right,  I mean,
right away.
At least if you remember,
which move you have to look at to,
understand boundary value problem, then
you can do it.
Okay, and the last one what we did in the
last lecture, was, okay, if there was a
two string.
A thin string and [SOUND] a thick string.
[SOUND].
experience in tension.
Okay.
The wave, possible wave in this [SOUND]
section.
I say, this is the string number one.
[SOUND]
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Because this is string number one.
I, I say this wave is g.
The wave, of a g, I always use g, for
right going wave.
Because of this is at a string num, number
one, I
use a subscript of 1 over there and x
minus ct.
[SOUND]
And because there is a discontinuity,
okay?
The something must happpen.
That is.
[SOUND] There will be some reflected wave,
at string number one.
And I uses, h for the reflected away,
propagating in negative x direction.
[SOUND] h1, x plus ct.
And, in here, something will, propagate
[SOUND] in this string number two.
Only
in, in, in, positive x direction, so I
call g, because it is right going wave.
And I'll use 2, because this is string
number two, [SOUND] x minus ct.
Somebody will ask whether,
this c, is the same as this c.
Okay?
And the speed of propagation, we didn't go
through the detail,
will depend on, this string,
characteristic string.
So, for generality, let's put this as c1
and this is [SOUND] c2.
Okay.
c1t [SOUND] and c2t.
And, the business we have to work on, at
the moment is,
determined, how much h1 we'll get with
respect to g1.
And how much g2 we will get, with, with
respect to g1.
In other words, we want to know, the
ratio, [SOUND]
between g1 and h1, which we call,
reflection [SOUND] coefficient.
Okay, physically, that, that is, that,
that makes sense.
And we also want to know, how much,
transmitted.
[SOUND] That is, the ratio between, g1 and

g2, [SOUND] that, is what we want to have.
So, we need to know r and tau, provided
that, there is right
going wave, left going wave and there is a
right going wave.
To know these two unknowns.
We absolutely need at least, not at least,
absolutely need to have two equations.
Okay.
If you have a three equation, then it's
overdetermined case, Okay.
If you only have one equation, that we
call mathematically, 
underdetermined case.
So, those two equations, has to come from,
discontinuity condition.
So, one is.
The wave, I mean, the displacement or
velocity
at this point must be continuous, that is
one equation.
And the force, acting on this element and
that element, has to, follow.
Newton's second law.
So, two equation, one is kinematic,
continuity equation and the other one is,
force balance equation, will provide us
the solution of R and tau.
And the results, show that in the last
lecture.
This is essentially, [SOUND] controlled
by,
this strange, interesting Z, 1 and Z2.
In other words, how much reflected is
totally depends on.
new concept, specific impedance of medium
string one and string two.
And I’ll go, details about this, today.
And how much it transmitted?
[SOUND] Depends on again.
[SOUND] characteristic impedance of a
string.
[SOUND].
So,
immediate conclusion is that,
if there is a two different medium.
In this case, string number one and string
number two.
How much it reflected?
How much it transmitted?
Totally, depends on z1 and
z2, and what is z1 and z2?
That is our question.
So, lets go back to our power point,
or my, our acoustics test.
[SOUND] What is this?
What is the z1 and z2?
Go ahead.
