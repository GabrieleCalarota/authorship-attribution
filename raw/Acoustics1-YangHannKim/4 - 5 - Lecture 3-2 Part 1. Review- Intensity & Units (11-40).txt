Let me try to review what we learned in
the last lecture.
[SOUND]
We mostly,
discuss about intensity [COUGH].
Intensity, which is vector quantity, and
normally we express intensity.
As a capital I.
And that is pressure multiplied by
the velocity.
Okay?
This, in fact, describes how much
energy is transmitted through a unit.
For example, unit surface, you
say that this
delta x and, sorry, if I denote this is
delta y and delta x.
This express how much energy
is going through this surface multiplied
by delta x and delta y.
So that is, in other words, net power flow
through unit area.
Because this is vector quantity, we have
to know what it means
by, the direction of intensity, the
direction of intensity.
The direction of intensity is normal, to
this surface, or it could have some
direction through the surface.
That's the question, okay?
So, the direction of the intensity can be
this direction or that direction.
Right?
Because the power transformed to the unit
surface.
So this case and that case is the same.
Oh, that's new to, to you.
All right.
And also we observed that.
The change of energy per unit
Volume,
has to be balanced by, [SOUND].
intensity flux through the surface.
Okay?
Or dimensional case, this is just the,
 hange
of energy per unit time, has to be
balanced by.
dix dx.
Okay, that's quite clear.
And we extensively work about notation of
Intensity,
in terms of complex variable, okay?
So the results we have was, the complex
intensity,
which is a function of x, has two
component.
One is, average intensity,
and the other one is, the imaginary part
that is reactive intensity.
Average intensity,
or intensity of rear part.
Okay?
In page 117 we can readily see this
average,
or rear part of the intensity is in fact
one half of the rear part.
of pressure times velocity conjugate.
And, reactive intensity is again one
half of the
imaginary part of pressure multiplied by
velocity, intensity.
Okay?
That is, in the beginning that expression
is rather,
rather awkward or rather not very sensible
to you guys.
The reason why we are using this complex
notation is because the complex
notation often very convenient in, in, in,
in, in, in handling linear acoustics.
But as I mentioned in the last lecture,
the intensity
is a multiplication of pressure and
velocity, therefore
we have this kind of rather complicated
expression.
Okay.
And also last lecture, we talked about the
frequency scale of sound,
which is not same as the linear scale
and we also mentioned why we use the
frequency of a scale octave,
and 1 3rd octave, general 1 n-th octave.
[SOUND].
And then we also learn about the center
frequency concept.
Center frequency of each
octave band, or center frequency of each.
1 3rd octave band.
One thing we found is a center frequency
of octave band is normally.
I mean, the bandwidth of the octave band
is about, about 70% of the center
frequency.
And bandwidth of 1 3rd octave band is
about 23%
of center frequency of 1 3rd octave band.
Reason why we are using this octave band,
1 3rd octave
band, is simply because the, the frequency
range human being can,
can sense starting from 20 hertz to 20
kilohertz normally, and then we will have
some demonstration associated with this.
Lets go back to the concept
of the decibel
scale.
Okay.
Mean square average.
As I wrote that I am averaging
the mean square sound pressure like this,
okay?
That's what you remember.

Okay, what if I have.
many frequency component,
for example I have 1 kilohertz 
component and
2 kilohertz component, and 500 component
and 125 hertz component.
What would be the mean square pressure?
Which is well proved and described in the
text.
But for example, if I have 1 kilohertz and
500 hertz sound.
When I square it, of course 100 hertz
sound then.
No, what, did I say 100?
Okay, okay 500, 1 kilohertz.
If I square it, 500 hertz sound would be
squared.
And the 1 kilohertz sound is squared.
And also the cross term between 500 and 1
kilohertz would be produced.
Right?
But if the
period of T,
average in time interval is long enough
then the across term average of across
term disappears.
So, we can prove that 
mean square average of total sound
pressure is equal to,
is equal to, mean square value, mean square 
value of individual
frequency component.

That is very important.
And let me and let me show you why this is
important.
By using the the powerpoint we have.
Okay, now.
This is mean square average.
And, we would like to know if there is a
two frequency component omega m and omega
n, all right?

And what would be mean square value when
we have a two different frequencies?
Here, here is the case when we
have m different, or n different frequency
components.
And our derivation shows that, as I
Demonstrate, the mean square pressure is the
sum of mean square pressure of individual
frequency components.
Therefore, I can argue that if I have a
pressure fluctuation like this
and I make Fourier transform, okay,
Fourier transform will give me
the frequency component at each frequency,
1, 2, 3 and m.
And if I draw the mean square value of each
frequency component,
it would looks like this, or in terms of
SPL, it look like that.
And in terms of SPL as well as 1 3rd
octave band.
It'll look like this.
So what you normally get is this, this
picture.
So each
frequency component.
If I.
It, it, this, this is the one half p, 
pm square.
So when I add up all this frequency
component I will get total SPL.
	Sound pressure level.
But as I, as I said before, this
component.
That has higher peak
will dominate the whole SPL because we are
measuring SPL in terms of, in terms
of decibel scale.
And decibel scale is the logarithmic
scale.
