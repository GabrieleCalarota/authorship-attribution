The last lecture we
actually reviewed very well known law,
which is Snell's law
that essentially determines.

How the, if you have a two different
medium
characterized by specific impedance of
medium.

 As called this incident wave.

It has certain, pressure amplitude
complex Pi and then propagating.
In the direction that has incident angle
theta i.

So this has to be wave number vector
multiplied by r
and this wave number vector K.
Of course has three component,
Kx, Ky and Kz in the direction
of, in it's vector ijk.
If I use.
The rectangular coordinate.
Well essentially it says that it is
propagating into space
with the wave, wave number k, okay?
This is simply the projection.
A wave number in upon x, y and z
direction.
Of course in two dimensional case or 2-D
case the k has only Kx and
Ky, and in this case, Kx has to be K.
That's the wave number, number of wave per
unit length propagating in this direction.
K and
if I use to coordinate.
That is X and Y, then it means that it
is Kx cosine K cosine theta i.
And the KY has to be K sine theta i.
Okay?
And also the reflected wave, Pr, has to be
complex magnitude Pr.
And then I have exponential j omega t.
Maybe I use plus over here, K dot r.
and then recognize that that has to be Kr,
that has to be Ki.
And this has to be Ki.
Okay?
If the transmitted way can be written
similarly that it has complex magnitude
and propagating in
certain wave number that has to be Kt.
Okay.
Hm.
So this is what we assume that if you have
two different medium.
We assume that there will a some,
some wave reflected and some wave is
transmitted.
Of course that has to be reflected angle
and that has to be transmitted angle.
Okay?
The issues is, questions,
questions is, what is the relation between
theta 'i', theta 'r' and theta 't'.
And a how the transmitted wave with
respect to Pi
and reflected where with respect to Pi has
to be.
The first one we call transmission
coefficient.
Second one is called reflected coefficient.
Okay.
Of course, that can be found from,
from where?
From the physical condition at
interference.
So what is the physical condition at
interference?
Pressure has to be same, and the velocity
has to be same.
But because this is the oblique incidence
case, we have two components.
One is pressure in x direction,
the other one is pressure in y direction.
The velocity in x direction and velocity
in y direction.
And because notes that,  the fluid
is inviscid.

[SOUND]
What do I mean by inviscid?
Simply, there is no viscosity.
Because there is no viscosity,
the pressure in y direction.
Okay.
So does not necessarily to be same.
In other words, there is, because there is
viscosity, if
I excite a fluid over there, then this
fluid will not move.
Okay.
The only pressure that has to be matched
on this surface of discontinuity has to
be pressure in x direction and the
velocity
in x direction and the velocity in y
direction.
[SOUND] Okay.
That gives us the solution about this
relation and this relation.
As well as this relation.
Okay?
Having understanding the physical
phenomena
associated with, oblique incident wave
We'll go to the case.
[SOUND].
When we have different
material, different type of flat surface
of discontinuing, for example.
What if, what if we have infinite plate?
Okay, we have infinite plate and suppose,
the wave
is incident obliquely, from this
direction and
then the wave will be reflected.
And of course the wave will be
transmitted.
We would like to especially know
the how this, look like.
And also we want to know Pt in terms
of characteristics of this boundary
because this is plate.
Plate means the physical structure
component that can transmit bending
rigidity.
[SOUND]
Compare with a membrane.
Membrane that can transmit the tension.
Okay.
And we would like to relate this one with
what we learned in be, before tau is
related with
what? Fluid loading impedance.
In the previous chapter.
Partition impedance plus fluid loading
impedance.
That's what we learned.
And that can be applied to the general
partition case when we have
normal distance.
And because that is related with, this one
is related with,
radiation into
fluid medium.
Okay.
So, we would like to see how this kind of
flat surface of discontinuity, in other
words, if the plate, infinite plate
carries the wave,
which we call bending wave.
And this direction, bending wave would
propagate this direction
and wave number of bending wave kb has to
be related with,
with number of this and that, and that
one, and that is our interest.
All right, Kb, how this one
is related with, related
with Ki, Kr and, and Kt.
That would be our interest.
Okay?
And then, our final objective
of this lecture would be, okay, we studied
the transmission loss and transmission
coefficient tau.
Or, you know, how the Pt is related to Pi.
Well, the infinite case.
Those infinite case will, how does
infinite
ca-, case is related with a finite case.
Okay?
The transmission coefficient or
transmission loss.
That is determined or predicted by
assuming the plate is infinite,
predict upper bound or lower bound of
transmission loss.
Okay, so, for example, if we want to
predict transmission loss of this kind of
case what
is it related to the power infinite and
the power finite
how those are related.
Well
then this is a very interesting
approach. So I want to compare this with
this.
Per unit area.
Okay, I'm saying transmission coefficient of
per unit area of this case.
Infinite case and a finite case.
Okay.
One simple way.
To look at this is let's look at the
transmission
loss upon this region.
Okay?
Note that, note that all case, all case
[COUGH]
[SOUND] transmission loss, transmission
coefficient is obtained, as if this is
[SOUND]
radiating sound through the medium, okay?
If radiation of this kind of plate.
It's larger than radiation of this kind of
infinite case and we have
bigger transmission loss or transmission
coefficient for the finite case.
Right, but if you look at this case.
Compare with that case.
Okay?
And suppose we have a fluid particle over
here.
And a fluid particle over here.
Okay.
Because of the edge effect.
Okay?
Suppose we have, very lar-.
[SOUND] Large, structure.
[SOUND] for having, the concept
rather in exaggerate way.
Obviously, I can effectively radiate, more
radiation compared with that case.
So I can argue that the transmission
coefficient which is the ratio between
Pt and Pi or the finite k has to be larger
than
transmission coefficient of infinite case.
So therefore, I can say, the transmission
coefficient in dB scale, that is.
One of, of t infinity of t
finite magnitude of scale, that is
Transmission Law.
For infinite case, always bigger than
transmission loss for the finite case.
Therefore, what we can, can, what it can
estimate
RTL transmission loss by assuming the
plate is infinite.
Always predict upper bound
of transmission laws of finite case.
Therefore, what we, what we, what we, what
we.
Estimate transmission laws based on
infinite plate is very useful.
It's very useful because S, because if you
have upper bound of transmission loss,
maybe I use equality over there.
I over estimated transmission loss,
therefore I can argue that what we
estimate is very safe estimation, in terms
of transmission loss.
So this is useful.
This is therefore very useful.
So that will be our conclusion of this
lecture.
So let me begin with the issue I just
[SOUND] start.
This.
And review what we have.
What is the relation?
Goes in using PowerPoint.
Okay, as I said before, the incident
wavelengths
would be like this because the incident
wave is propagating in this
direction, and the reflected, reflected
wavelengths has to be this amount.
And transmitted where it has to be this
amount.
As you can see here geometrically it
shares the same identity over there.
So lambda, lambda t
sine zeta, lambda t sine theta has to be
the same as lambda.
'i' sign, you know the incident angle and the
lambda 'r' sign theta 'r'.
So, sorry.
So this has to be same.
That gives me the famous Snell's Law and
it
is interesting if you look at this Snell's
Law in terms of wave number.
That says Ki sine theta i equals to Kr
sine theta r
and then it has to be same as Kt sine theta t.
That personally I think that is
interesting.
Because that means, that means the in
terms of wave number, the projected wave
number.
Upon the surface of discontinuity, the
service of discontinuity has to be same.
That makes sense.
Number of waves propagating on the surface
of discontinuity has to be same.
If I say again, number of wave numbers.
Our incident wave and number of, number of
waves of reflected
wave and number of waves of transmitted
wave has to be same.
So if you use that concept, okay?
So this is incident wave, and this is.
For example, reflected wave.
The interesting thing, physics can be
observed very easily over here.
So, K0, sine theta 0, is, for example,
this is
K0, and K0, sine theta 0, has to be this
length.
Has to be same as the K1.
K1 sine theta i, that is this amount.
So this one has to be same as this one.
No problem, until K
I mean, if it reaches to the some critical
angle.
Okay, over there.
Then, this has to be reach, this amount,
therefore in this case, theta i,
theta 1, has to be 90 degree.
So if we exceed critical for frequency.
Geometrically, it has to be this amount.
Therefore, Ki, there is no wave to make Ki
sine theta i has to be this
amount.
So one simple way is to make theta i, it's
greater than pi over 2.
And introducing some imaginary part over
there.
Okay, mathematically.
And you will see we need to put the, put
the minus sign over there.
Okay.
So, that produce interesting phenomena
because we have the wave propagating more
than pi,
more than angle pi over 2 and because of
this contribution we have evanescent wave.
In other words wave is
wave, wave is decreasing with respect to,
with, with respect to
for example, if we have this in with respect
to that distance therefore
the wave is very confined in the vicinity
of the interface.
So that is, very interesting phenomena,
wave which
can be seen by using the wave number
approach.
