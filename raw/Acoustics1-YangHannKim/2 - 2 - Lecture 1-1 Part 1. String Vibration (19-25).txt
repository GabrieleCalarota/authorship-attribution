Lecture number one.
[SOUND]
Okay, the reason why I'm not using,
in the beginning, the Power Point, is
because, this lecture aims to
give an opportunity to the students to
understand a fundamental
concept of acoustics is not, this lecture
is
not just transforming a lot of knowledge
acoustics to the students.
[INAUDIBLE]
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And this lecture is to convey, properly,
effectively, the fundamental
concept of acoustic to the students, so
that's why I'm using blackboard.
At the end of this lecture, I will use,
the
PowerPoint to summarize what I conveyed
during this lecture.
Waves, what is a wave?
Wave,
is, is what transforming information from
one place to another.
Okay.
So, there is a sound information like,
[SOUND].
And then this information will be
transmitted
by this medium to some other place.
So essentially wave handles space.
[SOUND]
Or position.
[SOUND]
And time.
[SOUND]
And in wave, the position, or space and
time, is not independent variable anymore.
And the space and time is related.
And we will study how this space and time
are related in this lecture.
Okay lets start with a very simple case.
Okay, very simple case, of wave.
Okay, mathematically very simple case is.
I'm sure everybody know this graph.
Okay, this is y equal x and that is y.
And this is x, x is coordinate to express
the distribution of information in x.
And y, what is measured.
With the respect to x.
For example, y is the
some, some some information.
Okay.
If it is moving in this direction, this
amount,
then we can write this is y equals x minus
b.
And then this is x minus b [INAUDIBLE].
OK, if b [SOUND]
is a c
zero t, in other words I'm moving this y
equal
x straight line, with the speed of c0-t.
And I can write, so y equals x minus c0-t.
Now the line is moving in this direction,
okay?
What if I have certain shape.
Which I may call it G sub X, and if this
shape is moving in space in X direction
by the speed of C, with time, then
I can write this is g x minus ct.
Okay, this is right going wave.
Alright?
G can be straight line.
G can be any sinusoidal one
Or G can be this kind of tri, triangular
shape of wave.
So generally I can say, any general wave,
one dimensional wave, can be written
G X minus CT, that is right going wave.
And plus H X plus CT.
And as you can see over here in this
argument, this is left
going wave, compared with this X minus CT,
right?
If you come here again.
If this moves that way, then this equation
is Y equals X plus B, right?
So this is left-going wave.
And this is right going wave.
Every one dimensional wave, can be either
right going wave or
left going wave, or some of left going
wave, right going wave.
So I can argue that this is a general
expression of all one dimensional waves.
Okay.
General one dimensional wave.
Is it true?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
It is true, because nobody can argue me
that 
that, is another type of 1 dimensional wave
[INAUDIBLE].
'Kay.
Now let's see one special case, okay.
Now I have wave, Y-X-T,
that is propagating an x direction X
minus C-T.
It is interesting that I am observing wave
G with respect to X.
What if I observe wave of with respect of
time?
That means, I want to observe g with
respect to time.
If I use argument t
As independent variable over there,
that physically means I'm
observing sound or ob- observing wave with
respect to time.
And this is, I'm observing wave with
respect to x as we can see over here.
Right, this is the coordinate of x.
We are seeing the wave propagating in x
direction.
But I want to see the wave with respect to
time, how could I see it?
Okay, I locate my eyes over there.
And I will observe the wave passing
through my eyes, as time goes on.
Then that is t minus,
minus X over
c.
Is it correct?
If I divide the
space, with respect of, by the velocity,
what will I obtain is the.
The time laps I experience.
So this is another, another way to
express the right going wave, Okay?
Okay, what if I have sinusoidal wave?
[SOUND].
then I can write yxt, yxt.
So x minus the sinusoidal wave case.
If it is sine wave then it looks like a sin
And X minus CT.
Right?
Instead of G, I pick up one special
propagating wave that look like a sine.
So in this case, sine wave is propagating
with a speed of C.
Okay.
Is there anyone who saw sine x minus ct?
Now, it's not possible because the
argument, of sine has to be radial.
Right?
And x Is, I mean scale of x is meter in
MKS unit.
So I need some factor
that can, that can change this x dimension
to radial dimension.
So let's call that as k.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay, introduce, arbitrary, [SOUND]
amplitude, and I can
argue that, this is, the sine wave
propagating in x direction.
Okay?
Now.
This simple mathematical expression will,
provide us
many interesting wave propagation,
property.
And you will surprise.
Okay.
Now this, can be written as, a sine KX
minus KCT.
Okay let me focus on this factor.
What is KC?
KC has to be Omega Right?
Everybody, everybody familiar with the
oscillation in time, is omega.
So kc is a related with omega.
And we know omega, [SOUND] is 2 pi f, f is
frequency in hertz.
Right?
So kC is related
with 2 pi f.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay,
k c is related with a 2 pi f and f is a
frequency
therefore we can say that is a 1 over T
and the T is a period.
Right?
And that means that means k is equal to 2
pi 1 t multiply c.
What is the
t times the c?
So t is a period and the c is speed of
propagation.
That means t multiply by c is how much
wave is a propagating with one period?
How much wave is propagating with one
period?
And that is wavelengths.
So
we obtain that k is 2 pi over lambda.
That is very interesting.
k is 2 pi over lambda.
Of course,
that is
[BLANK_AUDIO]
From the relation over there, that is 2
pie.
[SOUND]
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay.
Omega over c, that is 2 pie f over
c.
So from this relation, we can find that
lambda, is equal to c over f.
And frequency is the measure of
oscillation of wave in time.
And the lambda is the measure of
oscillation in space.
And wavelengths and frequency's not
independent.
In other words, oscillation in time is not
independent with oscillation in space, and
that is vital
key Concept to understand wave
propagation.
And this is called dispersion relation.
Okay?
Dispersion relation simply
dictate how the oscillation in time is related
with The oscillation in space.
Next lecture I will bring some
demonstration
to, to, to I mean, understand this
behavior.
So, the frequency of one kilohertz.
I will make a frequency of one kilohertz
by my mouth,
which is [SOUND]
This is one kilohertz.
I have app that can measure the frequency.
And I will show you, whether or not this
is correct.
Okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay.
I will whistle.
[SOUND]
[NOISE]
You can see the one kilohertz over here
and you can see two kilohertz
[NOISE].
It's not correct, so [SOUND]
This is two kilohertz.
Okay, one kilohertz,
What about the wavelengths of one
Kilohertz?
So c is a speed of propagation usually, I
mean, in, in, in normal condition.
c is a 343 meter per second, so 343
divided
by one thousand is about point 34 meter.
So the wavelengths of one kilohertz sound
is about
34 centimeter, which is, which is
pretty large.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay?
Wavelength of.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
[UNKNOWN].
[SOUND] Okay, let me see.
[MUSIC]
[SOUND] The wavelength
of this con is.
I have to divide 343 by 500.
So wavelength of this tone is about 60
meters.
If you go to the middle c that is 252
Hertz, the wavelength of middle c is
How much?
Is longer than obviously, 1 meter 1.5
meter, things like that.
So, it, it, it, it's very large wave we
are handling.
Okay?
So back to 1 kilohertz case, wavelength is
34 centimeter.
What I'm emphasizing by demonstrating my
whistle in conj in relation with this
famous dispersion
relation, is that I'm I'm just saying that
of frequency
oscillation in time is not independent
Frequency
oscillation in time is related with the
spatial oscillation
in space that is wavelength.
