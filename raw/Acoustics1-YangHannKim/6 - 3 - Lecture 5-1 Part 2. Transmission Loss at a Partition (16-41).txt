Okay, tau, if you rewrite tau for
limp wall case, we saw there is
minus j omega m plus 2Z0 and 2Z0.
Okay?
This expresses the motion of wall and
the wall has only mass and the reason why
we have a minus j omega m is because,
simply because we are seeing the motion in
terms
of impedance and impedance is force
divided by velocity.
Therefore, this is [SOUND] minus j omega
m.
The contribution of mass is simply minus j
omega m.
Then let me ask you, what is the contri-,
contribution of stiffness.
Then that is a K.
Because phase difference between mass like
behavior, sorry,
mass like behavior and spring like
behavior should be.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Minus j omega?
Or what about the mass like behavior and,
and the damping like a behavior.
There should be minus j omega m minus j
difference.
Okay?
Again, another minus j difference, with
mass.
Okay?
So this is pretty much associated with the
partition.
So let me call this is partition
impedance, Zp.
Okay?
And, this term over there 2Z0 is
the impedance that is seen, that
is see, saw, seen, right?
That is seen by the wall.
If there is only one medium, then it, it
look
like Z0, but it look at the medium in both
side.
Therefore, we have a two.
So this is fluid loading impedance [SOUND]
and fluid loading in it.
And in fact, this form
holds for everything.
So we are now succeeding to look at all,
any
kind of partition problem in terms of
fluid loading impedance and.
Partition impedance, this is quite in
terms
of my, this afternoon, this expression.
This is quite sexy expression.
So rest job you will do for any kind of
partition.
For example if you have a partition that
has a spring and a damping
or if you have some finite you know
plate.
To do, only job we have to do is to find
out the partition impedance of each case.
Then you can get transmission

coefficient or transmission loss if you
like.
And we do know this is fluid loading
impedance.
[SOUND] Okay?
So let's move on to study, what's going on
if you have
partition that has a spring mass and a
damping case.
Keeping that in our minds.
Alright.
So let's consider the case when we
have
spring [SOUND]
and a damping in the mass and suppose
there is an incident wave.
Then this should have reflected and
transmitted.
Again we assume that Pi
x t is equal to Pi capital complex
Exponential minus j omega t minus kx.
Assuming, for simplicity, we have
same medium over there and Pr xt is
Pr exponential minus j omega t plus
kx because we have left going wave
and Pt we can write Pt exponential
minus j omega t plus kx.
Same k because k equal omega over C, and
the we, we
assume there is the same medium therefore,
so same k we can use.
If you have another medium, you have to
use k1 and k2.
Same frequency because we are handling
linear acoustics, small sound pressure.
And I'll apply boundary condition and
everybody can
understand what boundary condition you can
use.
The pressure on left hand side would be Pi
plus Pr
and the right hand side is Pr.
Therefore, we are considering net force
acting positive
x direction and that has to be equal to
what?
Not just mass contribution, which is minus
omega square m Y, but we do
also have something related with 
the motion of.
I mean due to the damping force, that is,
this, and
now we have, [SOUND] contribution of k,
[SOUND] plus.
I don't know whether this is minus or
plus.
Is it minus?
Okay.

Oh, Pt. Sorry.
[SOUND] Thank you.
Maybe I owe you some money?
[LAUGH].
This is force balance.
And in the other words it's velocity
continuity, on, on, on, on, this side.
That would be Pi over Z0 minus Pr over Z0.
That has to be equal to the velocity of
wall?
What is this?
Minus j omega Y.
Alright?
And also, same, the same thing with on the
left, the right hand side.
The velocity of the fluid particle over
there is.
Pt over Z0 and that is also minus j omega
Y.
[SOUND] And we solve this equation.
Then we come up with this, and in this
case, partition
impedance look like what?
Partition impedance look like something
related mass and something related with
huh?
Damping.
Something related with spring.
Right.
So, the only change is the partition
impedance, and I, there may be some
correction.
Of this partition impedance.
Okay.
Lets look at what we have by using the our
PowerPoint.
It's okay?
Okay.
So, as I said, before this problem, can be
can be regarded at equivalent as we have
blocked pressure and radiated pressure.
Okay, and then, I explained this problem.
And then, we found this.
Transmission coefficient look like that.
Which is not same as I showed before.
But the reason why we made a mistake, is
because transmission
loss in terms of
impedance, that is pressure divided by
velocity, and that the formula I showed
is in terms of displacement.
So, we have to multiply j omega, and this
will give this.
And this is S is to stiffness.
And the reason why I use s instead of k is
because we use k as a wave number.
An rd term over here.
So in this expression, physically, this
means that there's two term.
Expresses damping.
What is a damping due to linear damping
over there?
[BLANK_AUDIO].
And the other one,
this one is damping due to radiation.
[SOUND] Okay.
There are two kinds of damping, in this
case.
One is damping due to the damper at
vibratory system.
And then the other one is damping.
Damping, what is damping physically?
Damping is energy loss.
So you can also lose your energy by
radiating.
But the radiated
pressure is something you, you, you are
losing.
[COUGH].
So that's why we have 2Z0, and this
again fluid, fluid loading.
Okay, that is interesting.
So again.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
If omega m increases.
Compare, so if omega m is getting large,
and large, in compared with s over omega.
That's the case when we increase omega
this will increase
linearly and this will increase one over,
one over omega.
So this term getting smaller and smaller
compared with omega m.
Then this formula actually follows the
mass law.
What about if omega is decreased?
Very small frequency then, this one
decrease but this one in, increase.
So when omega is getting small and
small.
This term, this term will follow dominated
by this s over omega.
That we called the stiffness controlled
region.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And this is just another look of, of, of
transmission coefficient.
And if you look at this, the term like
that.
Then this is partition impedance again.
So again, we can see the transmission
coefficient is composed of a partition
coefficient plus fluid loading impedance.
Alright.
[SOUND]
This just shows the sum of the case of
no of absorption coefficient.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So this is the highlight.
So, for high frequency.
It follows the mass law, 6dB per octave.
Low frequencies 6dB for octave as
we decrease the frequency, but then
over here, what kind of physical
element will dominate.
[COUGH].
This is mass controlled region, and
this is a stiffness controlled region.
This range damping controlled region.
So if you increase a damping does the, the
transmission loss
will increase.
[SOUND]
The transmission loss increase.
So over here, if you increase the damping,
it will increase, as you increase the
damping.
But, as you may easily see, this is most
expensive way to increase the transmission
loss, right?
For example, you have partition.
You increase damping.
Of course you can.
Increase the transmission loss, because
you
increase the damping, the movement that we
partition would be decreased, therefore,
the
radiation damping, radiated power will be
decreased.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So, you can use this kind of behavior if
you have, if you have a lot of money.
But if you are clever, of course, you will
use this control region, very obvious.
That's why I say.
The mass law, plays essential law, in
partition design.
Okay?
So this summarize everything related with
the partition, design.
This is the highlight.
