In the second week, we learned about the
relation between sound pressure, acoustic
density and particle velocity.
And we found that those three parameters
make, so called acoustic wave equation.
And this week, we will learn about
acoustic intensity as well as sound
energy.
Intensity, by definition, is the power per
unit area,
which means that how much acoustic power
is transmitted through the medium
per unit area.
And then we will also, learn about the
unit that measures acoustic pressure.
For example, decibel scale.
How we, how our hearing system feel 
about acoustic
pressure. Its magnitude, we normally use
decibel scale.
And you will learn about the decibel
scale.
And then the frequency scale, we will
talk about octave scale or one-third
octave scale.
That's what you will learn in this third
week.
