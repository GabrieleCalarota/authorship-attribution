Attempting to get a relation between
pressure, 
Did I say density?
Yeah?
Right, density.
Okay, when I see the infinitesimal change
of pressure.
So, I am pushing this bottle.
It is certain small piston over there, what
will happen?
The, the, the, there is a density change
as well as a volume change, okay.
Because I am
squeezing the particle of a mass inside of
this volume, the distance between particle
will be shortened.
Okay, and the fluid will feel some
pressure that will give some.
temperature change.
Right?
So, the change of pressure now involves
some
thermodynamic change.
So mathematically I can write the change
of pressure would
involve dp d rho, when some, 
thermodynamic state is constant so I say
isentropic process.
When, when I squeeze this, I mean compress
the air by, by, by some pressure, 
Of course a Newton make some
misunderstood or what's going to happen in
this case.
He assumed I, he assumed
isothermal process.
isothermal process. (Professor used a 
wrong expression on this problem)
The difference between isentropic process
and (details are explained in the forum)
isotropic process, isentropic process
assume that.
The bottle is completely insulated and
there is no heat exchange.
For example, when we have a like a 200
hertz sound.
[SOUND] The fluid is oscillating with the
200 hertz.
As you can see, 
you imagine that the fluid
particle is moving back and forth 200
Hertz,
there's no enough time to.
allow enough heat transfer, right?
Because it's rapidly back and forth.
Therefore, we can assume reasonably that
the particles of motion follow 
the reversible process.
Therefore, isentropic process.
And then d rho then I can write a
mathematical dp ds this is 0
because isentropic process.
So, this says the change of a small
pressure that is p prime,
and this is change of a small density that
is a rho prime, that
has to be dp d rho for certain 
isentropic process.
An experiment to show that this is related
with bulk modulus of fluid.
for, for the unit, unit density and that
is c square.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
This we call state equation.
So, I have three equations,
that relates pressure, density and
velocity.
Let me summarize what we have today.
We get Euler equation, linearized Euler
equation.
We have the relation between density and
velocity based
on conservation of mass, or continuity
equation, if you like.
And then we have state equation that says.
Relates, access pressure, and access
density, that is
proportional to the square of the speed of
sound.
And text summarize the how this speed
of sound
is changing with a respect to.
temperature,
humidity, and so on.
Let us think
a little bit more about this state
equation.
If I sing a song or if I sang some sound.
In a very hot bathtub, which means I have
very high humidity and high temperature.
The speed of sound would be higher than
the case when I shout, for example in
North Pole, where I have
dry air compared with the air I had in,
in, in the bathtub.
and a very low temperature.
Which case has a faster speed of sound,
high temperature or low temperature?
Mm-hm?
High temperature you got, high speed of
sound?
Okay, if it is not easy to think right
away,
say the speed of sound is proportionate to
the bulk modulus,
as I noted over there, compare with the
unit density.
What is bulk modulus?
What is bulk modulars?
The bulk modulus are simply saying the
how the volume, unit volume
of, of, of compressed air would resist to
unit pressure.
In other words I, I, I push.
The unit, unit, unit,
compressed the air, and if it is not easy
to get a unit
compression, that means the bulk
modulus is high.
Okay, suppose I am heating this small,
small compressed air.
Okay.
Then the action of fluid particle because inside
of volume is very large.
That means it is hard to get
a unit displacement compression using
unit pressure.
So high temperature, air has a larger
bulk
modulus, therefore I got higher speed of
sound propagation.
Okay?
There are other ways to envisage.
Or understand the speed of sound.
but, that could be the rough way to
understand how
the speed of sound is changing with
respect to temperature.
Okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So we have three equations.
And three unknowns, therefore,
we can express
these three equations by one unknown.
Variable.
In other words, if I eliminate u and rho
over here,
then I got the expression in terms of
access pressure.
Let's try to do it.
I have a du, dt over here.
I ha-, have a du prime, dx.
So why don't I operate d dx over there and
d, d dt over this?
Then, I can eliminate the du, d squarem ,dx, dt,
right?
So, I operate d dt over there.
Then, I got d square dx, dt, p prime,
has to be equal to rho 0, d square u d
huh?
No, no, no.
I want d,
dx square.
I want operate dx.
Okay.
Then I have the dt dx and operate dp over
there and now we'll get d square rho prime 
dp square and that has to be equal
to
minus rho 0 du prime, dx dt, alright?
So that's good.
So I would add up.
Then I got minus d square p prime dx
square plus d rho prime dt square
is 0.
Okay let's eliminate rho prime or.
Or convert rho prime to p square.
I can do that.
that is, rho prime is equal to p prime 1 over c
square.
So this is minus d square p prime, dx
square,
rho prime has to be equal to p.
So, this is d square p prime, dt square
and that has to be 0.
Therefore, I got equation that says
simply over there.
Equation simply saying that d
square p prime dx square
is equal to 1 over c square, d square p
prime dt square.
This is very much similar with what we
have for one dimensional.
wave equation of a string and that, in
that
case, we got d square y, dx square is
equal
to 1 over c_L square d square y 
dt square.
So as I noted before.
The wave propagating in the string, and
the wave propagating in a one dimensional
duct is exactly same because, it obeys
the same acoustic wave equation.
So this is fantastic, because what we are
seeing
it, in a string as well as in a dot.
obeys the same governing equation.
Alright?
So, we can say that the acoustic wave in a
duct,
for example, driving point impedance of
duct would be,
for infinite dot
driving point impedance would be rho c
instead of rho_L c_L.
And for the finite duct, driving point
impedance would be j times rho c.
co-tangent kL or similar function.
And obviously that would depend on
completely kL.
So, what we conclude is that by studying
one dimensional stream wave?
As can be worked exactly in the same manner
for one dimensional duct case.
Okay, so that’s nice.
So we just studied
acoustic wave equation,
where one dimensional case.
That look like that.
So let me expand what we learned in
one dimensional case to the three
dimensional case.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay?
Then the wave in y direction would follow
d square,
d square p prime dy squre has to be
equal to 1 of 1 over c square dp dt square
and in z direction it would be d
square p prime the z square is
equal to 1 over c square dp prime over the
dt square, therefore.
we can say the pressure has to be.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
This is general three dimensional
acoustic wave equation.
So mathematically, our business is to
solve this,
three dimensional wave equation.
Try to find the solution that satisfies
the boundary condition, mathematically.
So that's pretty, straight forward
problem.
Okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
There are two ways, actually.
One way is, suppose I have this
rectangular room, for example.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
A rigid wall.
Okay.
And I do know that the wave in this
direction
has to satisfy the boundary condition over
here and over there.
That is the case the velocity is 0, and
the pressure is maximum.
So, I can say that should be cosine if I
denote if this is
y direction then Ie can say that has to
cosine L minus y
something like that,
because cosine has a maximum pressure over
here and then maybe
integer multiple of cosine would satisfy
same boundary condition.
So I have a solution in this direction and
this, and this and this.
And the solution in this direction will be
this and some this and so and so.
I have many, many solution.
Okay.
And I say the solution to satisfy this
room would be p,
x, y, z, t can be written as the summation
of the solution in x direction and the
solution in,
maybe I say, 
y direction and solution in
z direction ijk.
And I want to find out the weighting of
ijk.
And that this is, what we called 
eigenfunction that
satisfy boundary condition as well as the
wave equation.
And this is simply the contribution of
each term.
That is one way to see the solution.
It's like I assume the solution, and I'm
trying
to find out how these each solution or each,
Each component is contributing to the
solution.
Okay.
This is what we called in the text
eigenfunction approach.
Another approach could be, okay, suppose I
have.
I know certain solution
like a monopole solution, or a dipole
solution, or a quadrapole solution.
I know that solution satisfy this
governing equation.
Then I attempt to allocate or.
locate this dipole quadrapole, monopole
solution
In such a way that would satisfy boundary
conditions.
That would be the bases of using boundary
Element method.
So you can use either boundary element method, 
or eigenfunction approach,
to get the solution that
satisfies any boundary condition.
Okay?
This is just a very conceptual
explanation.
How this governing equation and boundary
condition
could be applied to find the solution.
And this course is not for finding those
solutions.
An numerical solutions or theoretical
solutions.
This, this course is to deliver the
what would be the basic concept, 
to understand the fundamentals of acoustics.
Okay.
So let's summarize what we learned today.
This is what we learned today, alright.
Access pressure, acoustic pressure,
satisfy acoustic wave equation.
That is quite similar with the one
dimensional wave equation.
Therefore I can say p prime, x, t for one
to measure, 
of course, satisfy g, x minus ct, plus 
h, x plus ct.
Right going wave, left going wave.
And the reflection coefficient will
satisfy z1 plus z2.
z1 minus z2 where z1
is rho1 z1,
And z2 is rho2 z2.
And how much transmitted will follow
z1 plus z2 2 z2.
In other words, suppose
I have flat surface of this continuity and
this medium is z1 and this medium is z2.
And the wave is coming over there,
something is reflected and something is
transmitted.
The ratio of reflection and ratio of
transmission will follow this simple
expression that only composed by,
characteristic impedance of medium.
 That was the same at, was the same as what we
observed for the string case.
Of course, driving point impedance,
would be same.
For infinite case, that would rho c, 
rho0 c.
For a finite case that would be j times
rho0 c, multiplied cotangent kL, or some
other function.
Depending on the boundary condition.
Therefore we can, we can conclude that the
Everything,
At least the transmission and reflection,
totally depends on the impedance of
medium, okay?
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And also, we learned that the relation
between
p prime and the rho prime and the u.
The relation between p prime and the u
is governed by Euler equation.
The relation between rho prime and u is
governed by mass conservation.
The relation between p prime and rho
prime is discovered by state equation.
And the whole this process is governed by
wave equation.
Okay, that summarize what we learned today.
This is a fantastic, this is a fantastic
result.
So major psychical measure that 
describe acoustics.
is p prime, rho prime and u.
Okay?
And impedance, and we saw the impedance,
how much reflected and transmitted.
Dominates the reflection and transmission
and, and
when you look at the driving point
impedance,
not only in impedance is it really
characterized, driving point impedance.
That certainly, a measure what's going on
in the field.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Driving point also strongly
depends on kL.
This is very important measure because it
measures a space with respect to
wavelength lambda.
Because k equal to pi over lambda, so in
acoustics, absolute measure
meter scale, or fits scale, or
yard, mile, doesn't have any meaning.
In acoustics, the length scale has to be
scaled by wave lengths,
okay.
So when you have like 220 hertz.
This wavelength is like one point how much
1.2 1.3 1.something little bit over one
meter.
When I see the this bottle, when the wave
I blow [NOISE] when this wave see this
Bottle. This is very small.
But when 220, 20 hertz sound waves.
See this, this lecture hall.
This lecture hall is very large.
Right, so, so we can see and be say the
concept of.
Acoustically in a large space and
acoustically in a small space also.
This conclud today's lecture, I hope
everybody understood what I try,
what I have tried to
lecture today.
