Let's review what we've learned in the
last lecture.
[SOUND]
Basically, we've learned
that in acoustics, access pressure and the
density
and velocity are the major
parameters that describe
the property of, of, of, compressed
or I mean acoustic waves.
And we found that the relation between the
pressure and acoustic velocity
can be returned as so called Euler
equation.
that physically says that the, the
pressure difference along infinitesimal element,
has to be balanced by the fluid
density multiplied by the velocity.
And the relation between access pressure
and the density
p over rho
[BLANK_AUDIO]
is characterized by so called state
equation
P prime over rho prime has to be c squared,
and the relation between density and
velocity of fluid
follows the law, cons, conservation,
conservation law.
Okay this follows the conservation law,
conservation of mass.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay so and that, that can be written as.
d rho dt has to be balanced by

the flux of, of mass.
through the surface of the, of the
element that we have interest.
Okay.
And all these relations can
be summarized by the form of acoustic
wave equation
which can be written like that.
Where p is access pressure,
or acoustic pressure.
Alright.
Then the next question is, what other
acoustic measures
has a significant meaning 
The first candidate would be energy.
We would like to know
acoustic energy per unit volume, 
for example.
Okay.
Then I can write acoustic energy
would be composed by two components.
One would be potential energy,
and then the other one is kinetic energy.
Okay. Let's start with very simple one
first.
Kinetic energy [SOUND].
per unit volume, per unit volume
can be expressed
as one half, one half
rho zero, rho zero is the
mean acoustic density
times velocity u square.
Of course, one can argue that there is a
I mean strictly speaking acoustic
energy has to be one half rho zero plus u
prime u square.
But the contribution of energy due to the
fluctuating component of, density
is a relatively smaller than this
contribution due to the mean density.
Okay, what about the potential energy?
Acoustic
potential
energy.
So let's see
how much energy the compressive fluid can
store
by changing units or infinitesimal
volume change, okay.
To start with, let's consider the one
dimensional case.
Again, duct
Suppose I have a pressure over here.
This will push the surface in this
direction.
And I have some pressure p0 plus p prime
that is access pressure.
This access pressure will shrink.
[SOUND]
This amount of volume or length.
Let's call this is delta L.
And then let's use coordinate from here to
that is x.
This is a positive direction.
Okay?
And this is negative compression I mean
the, the
compression is done by the, the
displacement in this direction.
So I put minus over there, not to confuse
any unnecessary things.
Okay then, the acoustic energy stored in
this volume
can be studied by looking at this graph.
Okay?
So pressure and compression
per unit length.
Okay?
The relation between the pressure, which
is a force, and the
delta L over L is the,
compression per unit length,
that is very akin with the spring constant
if you like
and the stored energy is this, so I can
write the potential energy per unit
volume.
Would be one half p times minus delta L
over L.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay, the last things
is to convert to this vari, variable.
To one of this variable, p, u, or rho.
Because that I call prime variable, prime
variable.
Or, or in the text I said that is
representative acoustic variable.
So let's convert this to those prime or
representative values.
How to do it? 
The compression has to follow what law?
Conservation of mass, so that means
originally the mass
of this volume has to be, this is the
length L, from here to there.
That is the length L.
Then I can say, in the beginning when
there is no access acoustic pressure,
the mass in this volume will be 
rho zero s and L.
Okay, that mass is changed by this
compression.
Okay, that is rho zero is increased 
rho prime if you like.
or rho.
Okay.
And then, L, delta L and s.
Okay.
I put plus over there.
What I'm saying over here is originally
this is the total mass.
When I have delta L in this case, I am
following the coordinate of this.
That is
I mean elongated lengths delta L multiply
by s and rho zero plus rho
has to be equal to the rho zero s L.
Okay, this relation gives
rho zeo sl equal to rho zero L s
plus rho zero delta L s
plus rho
L s plus rho delta L s, therefore this one go
out.
And I got, I got
I got what I got.
Okay.
rho zero L,
rho zero L plus rho L plus rho delta L
has to be equal to zero, or this one has
to be canceled [LAUGH] rho zero delta L.
Okay.
This is what I have.
[SOUND] And rho L.
Okay.
And the rho delta L.
This is small quantity, a very small
quantity.
Therefore, this is negligible compared
with the other thought.
So what I got is.
L delta L minus has to be equal to rho
over rho0.
Here rho is rho prime.
So, now I have this has to be equal to one
half p.
rho zero, rho prime, rho
and I'm using state equation that says p
over
rho has to be c square, so I got, I got.
I, I plug this rho, should be p over c
square.
so potential energy has to be equal to
well-known form.
[SOUND]
So that therefore potential energy,
one half p square over rho zero c square.
That is acoustic potential energy, so in
somebody, what I have, so total acoustic
energy,
has two components, and one is one half p,
rho zero c square.
And that the other one is a 1 half, 1 half
rho zero u square, p square, alright.
That's interesting.
This is potential energy and this is
Kinetic energy.
What other energy could be possible in,
in, in, in the compressible fluid?
Of course, another possible energy would
be the energy
do to viscous force or You know,
anything
related with friction, question ?, so we
are neglecting the anything relates where
the viscous damping.
Plus damping term

Due to friction.
So the, the, the fluid we are handling
does not have a damping term.
In other words, when I blow, when I blow
whistle using here
[SOUND]
then, then inside of this
pipe, because there is no damping, if I
close this,
then you can hear same sound, like 100
years later.
Because there is no damping.
Okay?
If you want to consider damping, you are
more
than welcome but that makes our acoustics
very complicated.
So this is the acoustic energy.
What other.
Physical measures has a significant meaning
on acoustics.
