Let me begin with the
lecture number eight.
We will continue to talk about chapter
three.
Waves on flat surface of discontinuity.

There will be lots many different kinds of
discontinuity.
Okay, simple discontinuity is, I have two
mediums.
[SOUND] Z0 and Z1.
Z0 could be.
Air.
And the Z1 could be water.
Or Z0 could be air, and Z1 can be sound
absorptive material.
Z1, Z0 can be water, and.
Z1 can be, for example, the
wood or steel whatever.
Or you could have
air and sound absorptive material and you
might have some wood and you could have
steel
plate and then you will have air or water.
Many kinds of discontinuity
is possible.
So to understand what happen on this kind
of discontinuity, or you can have for
example.
Just mass type of wall.
We call this is limp wall or you
might
have a wall that not only have a mass but
have some equivalent spring and dashpot.
Or you have some general plate that allow
bending motion.
As well as you could allow some spring
and damping over here.
Many kind of discontinuity is possible.
And also consider the
type of incident wave, this
considers the discontinuity.
And if we think about the type of
incident wave.
Simple incident wave, of course, is plain
normal
incident wave that will induce reflection
and transmission.
And other more general type of incident
wave, would
be, you have incident wave that has a certain
angle of incident theta i, I call this is
Pi.
Then it will be reflected with a certain
angle
P theta r, and also it will be transmitted
with
certain angle that I call transmitted
angle.
And again, I could ask you, what if I have
the discontinuity as some fluctuating wave,
what would happen in terms of reflected
and a transmitted wave.
Okay.
This is sort of general physical
circumstances.
And next question will be what would be
the appropriate measure.
What would be appropriate measure?
[SOUND].
Or measures?
That properly,
or effectively describe this kind of
physical phenomena.
So, in the last lecture we introduced
reflection coefficient, [SOUND] which is
simply the ratio between magnitude of
incident wave with respect to reflected
wave.
And also we introduce transmission,
transmission
coefficient tau, that is Pt over Pi.
Okay.
So to understand the.
Meaning and importance of these two
coefficients
which I introduced as a candidate of
appropriate measures that
represent all the physical behavior
associated with this, rather, if you like,
complicated physical phenomena.
We have looked at the behavior of these
two measures.
For the case of these very simple cases.
Okay.
For this case we found that the reflection
coefficient is just simply the function of
the characteristics, characteristic
medium.
That is Z0 plus Z1
over there, that is Z0 minus,
Z0 minus Z1 ?, or Z0, Z1 minus Z0?
Okay. Z1 minus Z0.
Then I have to use this one, Z1 plus Z0.
Okay?
Transmission coefficient, look
like Z1 plus Z0,
and a 2 Z1, as far as I remember.
And also I remember I made the
mistake to drive the transmission,
velocity transmission coefficient and
velocity reflection coefficient.
[SOUND]
But, I'm
sure the every students found where, I
made a mistake.
So let's begin with reviewing.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Was the physical meeting of these things
for this simple
case, and then we would move on to this
case.
Okay, so let's see what we have.
Okay.
So this, this is what I said.
So the expression we have is the has the
form
of right going wave observed with
respect to time because it's easy
to apply the boundary condition at x
equals zero over here.
So I am applying boundary condition to get
a, the relation between Pt and Pi and Pr
over Pi, so this is boundary condition
pressure continuity
and velocity continuity the reason why we
have a minus sign over here is because
velocity of reflected wave has this
direction.
And the velocity of incident wave has this
direction.
And velocity of, velocity of
transmitted have, wave, has this
direction.
And we have two equations.
And we have the unknown Pt, Pi, Pr, Pt.
Therefore, we can get a ratio between Pt
over Pi and the Pr over Pi that we
call the transmission coefficient as well
as a reflection coefficient.
And
this is what we have reflection coefficient
and a transmission
coefficient and that is a pressure
reflection coefficient and a transmission
coefficient in strictly speaking, so,
that does not represent what we can hear
or what
we can, what we can actually sensed, by
the instrument.
So what we can he, what we hear is very
much associated where the power
transmission coefficient, that is pressure
multiplied by velocity in real value.
But if we use the complex value, power is
as we noted before the power of acoustic
wave is a pressure,
complex pressure multiplied by the
conjugate of,
complex velocity.
Therefore what we have
is this.
This is the power reflection coefficient
and this is the power transmission
coefficient.
Looks complicated, so to find out what's
the meaning
of this power reflection coefficient and
the power transmission coefficient.
We have to look at this in terms of graph
or experiment but experiment is rather
costly.
Therefore, the, the effective way to
explore what
does it mean is look at the physical
meaning in terms of a graph.
So let's see the graph.
Okay this is the graph of reflection
coefficient which is this.
This is reflection coefficient and okay
this
is the reflection coeff- this is
transmission coefficient.
As you can see here when you get.
When you get
when Z equal to Z0 over here, you will
have zero transmission coefficient.
That make sense because two medium is
identical.
Okay.
But when you get large and large.
Impedance mismatch, which is, over here,
is a 20.
You will have big reflection coefficient,
a,a, and a transmission approach to, to 1.
Anything wrong over there?
You have a question?
[SOUND]

Right. Reflection and transmission are changed.
This is tau, right?
Hm?
And this is r.
Alright, thank you very much for
correcting my mistake.
And this is velocity
reflection as well as transmission
coefficient.
Let me see, carefully to avoid any further
mistake.
And.
[COUGH].
This one is velocity transmission
coefficient.
Correct? So if you see these two
graphs at the same time you will see that
the velocity transmission coefficient is
going down as the ratio between the two
medium is increased but transmission,
pressure transmission coefficient is
increasing.
So that's good.
That's good.
Because that will solve our paradox,
right?
When,
when I make a noise in air and I asked you
whether or not the fish will
hear the noise I'm making over hear,
that's the case, that's the case,
when Z1 is very large compared with Z0,
okay?
The transmission coefficient is increased
to two.
But because the, velocity transmission
coefficient is going to
approach to zero so fish cannot hear my
lousy sound over here.
So at the fishing spot you can even turn
on your radio and enjoying fishing.
Okay.
And a power transmission coefficient and
reflection coefficients
turns out to be look like that and this is
the power
transmission coefficient and this is again
the
transmission coefficient of power as you
can see here as,
as the impedance ratio increases, it
rapidly goes down.
