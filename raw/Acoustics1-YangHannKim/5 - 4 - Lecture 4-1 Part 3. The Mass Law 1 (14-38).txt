What if I have wall that
can be regarded as the wall that has only
mass which I say limp wall.
And then,
what happened we want to see.
Again we write Incident wave like that and
the reflective wave like
that and over here some look different form.
But that is j omega t minus omega over
c0 x,
therefore that is the same as the
form we used before.
And there is transmitted wave.
And we assume that the wall is vibrating
with the, with the some frequency of
omega.
And let's see what's going to happen.
First.
At x equals zero the unbalanced force will
move the wall
okay for unit area.
This is the force per unit area acting on
this wall.
There is the pressure due to incident and
reflected on this surface and
there is a pressure due to the transmitted
and this pressure and that pressure.
One pressure is, I mean pressure on this
side will act this
way and pressure on that side will act
that way, therefore this one
minus that one is net pressure acting in
positive x direction.

And that has to be equal to, according to
Newton's second law,
mass times, that is mass per unit, unit
area, times the acceleration.
That is the

double time derivative of this.
So, this would give me minus j omega and
minus
j omega twice that I have minus omega
square Y.
Okay?
So, this is what I get.
This is the of, of force continuity, or
I would say the force balance between
unbalanced force and the motion
of the plate per unit area.
And that has to be, also, another
constraint or condition.
That has to be satisfied is, one thing is
this.
That simply says the velocity
due to this fluid particle,
that is one component is Pi over Z0 that
is the velocity of incident wave.
And that is the velocity of reflected wave
and a minus sign again, again to
reflects velocity of reflected wave should
be opposite sign of incident wave.
And that has to be same as the velocity of
this partition, mass limp wall that is
minus j omega Y.
Because I assume that displacement Y is
magnitude of Y, exponential minus j omega t.
Take a derivative of this displacement
with respect to time, will give me this.
Physically, I say, again, this
mathematical
expression says, the fluid particle over
here.
The, the velocity of fluid particle over
here
has to be same as velocity of partition.
And this expression says, velocity over
this fluid,
this partition has to be same as the
velocity
are the right hand side of the partition.
Again, this is the velocity of part,
partition because
Pt over Z0 is velocity for plane wave
case.
And this is simply the derivative of this
assumed displacement.
Now, we have three equations.
And three unknowns which is known as
Pr over Pi and Pt over Pr.
And we also, Y is unknown
so, therefore we can solve it.
So the solution looks like this.
And then.
Power transmission coefficient looks like
that.
Therefore the magnitude scale of the
transmission coefficient looks like this.
And these very interesting.
Why?
For example, if omega is very high then
tau approaches to what.
Omega is very high
then tau approaches to zero.
That means no transmission.
If m is very high.
In other words, mass is very high.
Then, again, no transmission.
That makes sense.
Okay.
I, I am shouting here.
And in front of me there is a big thick
mass.
Then no transmission.
That is very likely, you know, [inaudible]
what I can imagine.
Well also this is interesting.
This is a function of omega.
And when omega is very high,
that means I have a wall
when I generate a high frequency.
And if I generate a low frequency
[SOUND]
then the transmitted amount of
transmission is, strongly depends on
frequency.
Therefore, according to this formula,
as the frequency goes high, then
transmission will be reduced.
That physically means that if we have a
wall
and there is a somebody is talking,
then what you hear would be
very much associated with the low
frequency.
That's why often in your lab, in your lab
or dormitory, what you can
hear the sound which supposed to come from
the next door would be not
like, ee wee wee, but you will hear,
whoaaaa, very long frequency.
You will say somebody is turning on some
music.
Just, you know, next door.
But what you can hear during the light,
you'll,
night you can, you can hear only low
frequency.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Not high frequency component.
Right?
That's very interesting.
Those things comes from this mathematical
expression.
That we call "mass law", "mass law".
This is "mass law".

This is mass law.
This is well known mass law.
Okay.

Now.
For design purpose, we would like to have
tau minimum, right, as small as the tau.
When we, when we make some partition or
whatever, curtain
to, to, to have minimum transmission.
In other words, when you are working in a
factory, you have lousy noise and you want
to make some quiet office place inside of
a lousy, I mean noisy
factory.
What do you want to have?
Minimum transmission.
Minimum transmission.
So for design purposes, we would like to
have maximum one over tau magnitude
of scale, and because we are measuring
sound dB scale.
We put 10 log10 over there and that
we call transmission loss.
So, for the design purpose we would like
to have maximum transmission loss.
Okay?
Now,
the, because the transmission loss
magnitude of scale is equal to 2 Z0
omega m square plus 2 Z0
I think it was magnitude square, or 2 Z0
square.

I upside down this, omega m square.
Plus two Z zero scale divided by 
2 Z0 square that has to be actually
magnitude.
Then you look like that.
Then I divide this, this is one and.
So it turns out, when omega m over 2 Z0 is
very
large compared with 1, it looks like that.
Therefore, this formula says, when omega m
increase twice,
that means I have 20 log 10.
omega m over 2 Z0.
But if omega is increased twice that look like that,
then what I will have
becouse of the log before I will have 20
log.
10 to the two plus 20, log 10, two
omega m divided by 2 Z0, so
that means I have increased
the transmission loss by 20 log10 by
two.
And what is this?
This is a 6 dB.
That means I increase, as I increase the
omega or m
twice then I obtain about 6 dB
transmission loss.
So that is interesting.
So I have a wall over here.
If I increase the mass per unit area by
twice,
then I can obtain 6 dB transmission loss.
Again, that means the noise would be
reduced by 6 db.
If the wall follow mass law, uh,what kind
of wall really follow the strange mass
law?
Mass law is the wall that has only mass.
What does it mean?
Do you have a wall that has only mass m?
If you can find me, let me know, then I
will buy it.
[LAUGH]
So today's
lecture, I attempted to explain the
analogues
Between the string transmission and
reflection, and the transmission and
reflection
for the plane wave when we have a
two medium that has a flat surface of
discontinuity.
And then we went to, up to mass law.
And I will talk, I will continuously talk
about mass law next, in the next lecture.
And then the next lecture we will, we will
emphasize
the how to use a mass law, in practice.
