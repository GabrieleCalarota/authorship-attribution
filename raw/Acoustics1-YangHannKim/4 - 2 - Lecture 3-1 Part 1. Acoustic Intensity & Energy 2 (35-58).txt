Let me begin with what we have learned in
the last lecture.
We learned that in acoustics the
basic, so called representative
parameters in acoustics,
is the pressure, actually pressure
we mean access pressure or acoustic
pressure, which is fluctuating small
pressure.
And we also talked about the
density, which is
mean density, and the fluctuating density
that due to the fluctuating access
pressure.
And also fluctuating small velocity, the,
those are
what we call representative acoustic
variables.
And the relation between access pressure
and acoustic
pressure was described by the Euler
equation.
That simply says the pressure difference
across the small
distance in space will induce the fluid to
be accelerated.
That'll be called linear,
linear, Euler equation [SOUND].
And the relation between density and the
velocity,
of course, governed by the conservation of
mass, simply says that the change in
density
with respect to time and space has to be
balanced
by the mass flux across the volume through
the surface.
So that is minus d rho dt, has to be d dx rho u,
and also the relation between
pressure and density is determined
by the so-called state equation.
That is p prime over rho prime has to be
proportional to the velocity squre,
where the velocity in this case is speed
of propagation square.
Last night I, attempted to
find the meaning of intensity.
That's what we learned in the last
lecture.
In the last lecture, we also discussed
about the measure of pressure.
For example, how do we measure the
pressure?
So we introduced the disperse scale,
before we
review the decimal scale I though that,
we
needed some more discussion about the
intensity.
So last night I start with the
one dimensional Euler equation, which I
already wrote down over there.
This is a mathematical expression of Euler
equation.
Physical meaning of Euler equation is
rather straightforward.
Meaning that, if you have a force balance,
or pressure balance, in space,
the the fluid will be accelerated, and
this describes the motion.
This describes the unbalanced, 
unbalanced the pressure.
So that is interesting.
Of course, I would like to remind you that
based on this equation, I,
mentioned about the principle of
measuring, measuring
intensity. So, what if I, what if I
attempt to calculate the intensity from
this equation?
What I can do is intensity in one
dimension is p multiplied by
u is simply means that the power flow
right?, power flow.
Physical meaning of a power flow is how
much energy is per unit time,
is, is coming, is, is, is, coming through
this two surfaces, okay?
Later on I will also talk about the vector
information of the intensity.
So rearranging this equation, to get a, to
get a pressure
lead us by integrating pressure with a
respect to space.
So that is p, and then I move this rho
zero, du, dt, I move
minus sign over there, and then I will
integrate across the space.
That is the pressure, and then if I
multiply the velocity
to get a power flow then I can write pu
is minus, minus rho
zero u du dt dx, okay?
Then I can rewrite this, pu, that is power
flow or one dimensional
intensity, is minus rho zero, and I can
write, this
is du square, dt, dx.
Then I have to use one half over there.
And this one is, and this one is the same
mathematically, but physically, this
means, this term essentially means that,
that is a, d dt.
Sorry, d dt, and the one half rho zero
the one half rho zero u square.
And then everybody knows what it means, so
this is, this is acoustic, acoustic
kinetic energy.
So by just simply manipulate again the
Euler equation, we obtain that the
intensity is very much related with
rate of change of acoustic kinetic
energy through this, this surface.
So, that is very interesting.
So let us, let us, look at some more
details
about acoustic intensity by looking at the
looking at the acoustic intensity for two
cases.
One case, case one,
we want to see how the acoustic intensity
propagate in one dimension.
And there is the, when there is infinite,
infinite
duct, in other words, the termination of
this duct is the
eh, is the there, I mean termination
of this dot is non-reflected boundary
condition.
Okay?
Now there, there will be no reflection.
Intuitively, we can think that the
intensity
there is a very the direction of the
intensity has to be this direction, all the
way.
What about the intensity fluctuation with
respect to time?
And what about the intensity fluctuation
with respect to space?
How does it related with the
intensity of what we have been learning?
And the case 2, is the case
when we have oscillating source over
there, what we have rigid end.
This case and that case, there's two
extreme cases.
One is no reflection, the other one is
perfect reflection, okay?
General case, for example, when we have
a impedance boundary condition, over, over
there.
Then the physical behavior of that general
case
would have follow somewhere in between
these two cases.
That's why we would like to see these two
extreme, extreme cases.
So let's see how the intensity varies with
respect to time.
I want to say two things over here.
The pressure we assume that the, the,
the pressure field inside will propagate
like that.
In complex notation, I would like to, this
would be p zero and
then exponential minus j, omega t minus
kx.
That is complex notation later, later on,
later on, I will, I
will introduce the complex notation of
intensity which is, which is
somewhat, somewhat cumbersome and somewhat
not easy to understand.
And I will, I will address the, the reason
why it is not easy to understand later on.
But, it is quite natural to write inten,
pressure like in, in this form, reason?
As I mentioned before, because we are
handling linear acoustics, okay?
And also, we are, are we are, very much
often operating the pressure change with
respects to space, that d d d, d dx and so
on.
And if you operated the change of pressure
with space, that
means I operate d dx over this expression,
then if I use the
cosine and sine form, then every time that
I take a derivative
with respect to time or space, the equal
sign and sign form will
change, and sometimes it produces a minus
sign, plus sign,
so on, so on.
So it, it is, it is, rather,
bothering very much us, because of that
kind
of, I mean chain, so we introduce complex
notation.
And then, by just taking real part, then
we obtain the pressure like that.
So, what I will attempt to do is, because
we are handling linear acoustics,
we try to express pressure or velocity in
complex form.
And then when we got the result, we just
take the real part, okay?
That is good.
But, but, not always that is nice, because
if you look at intensity, intensity is
pressure times velocity.
So now you involved a multiplication, or
if you involve the
impedance, then you have to handle with p
divide by velocity.
That is not straightforward, so you have
to
be very careful to use complex notation
when
you handle intensity or, or the impedance.
Okay now, because we are handling two
acoustic variables,
pressure and velocity, of course it has a
physical meaning.
It means power flow per unit area, and
that certainly provide us very
very useful physically meaning, but you
have to be very careful.
So, let's see, let's see how it is useful,
and what's
the things we have to care about when we
use this notation.
Okay, now, pressure is p 0 cosine omega t
minus kx, and I can write to this
using complex notation, real part of p
non, exponential j omega t minus kx.
Okay?
Then the velocity can be written like
that,
this obtain velocity's obtained from
pressure using Euler equation.
Okay?
And it is interesting now, if you see the
result,
the pressure is P zero cosine omega t minus
kx.
And ux is also u zero cosine omega t minus
kx.
In other words, the pressure and the
velocity,
both of physical quantity, has a cosine
form.
In other words, the pressure and velocity
has the same phasee.
In other words, when I push fluid with
some pressure p zero cosine omega t.
Then fluid particle will move u zero
cosine omega t minus kx.
In other words, physically meaning that,
when I push the fluid the fluid particle
will, will move with the same phase as I
excite the fluid.
This is the case when we have infinite
media.
Infinite media meaning that there is no
reflection, meaning that, in other words
when I push the fluid, because there is no
reflection from the boundary, the fluid
or energy per unit area has to be
effectively
drive the medium, no reflection.
So that indicates that intensity, if you
look at the intensity, that it is possible
to
characterize the, the medium you are
exciting.
This is one reason why we, we often look
at the intensity in space, okay?
This is some more details.
The first column, the first law I'm sorry,
shows
that the pressure at x equals zero with
respect to time.
In other words, I want to see the pressure
right
at this point, right at this point, with
respect to time.
A mathematical expression is available
over here, so I
put x equals zero over there, then I got p zero 
cosine omega t.
That's simply this, p zero cosine omega t.
This is time.
So, yeah, there is a pressure change,
where I observed the pressure
right over here, and there is a pressure
change following cosine omega t.
And what about the velocity at x equal zero?
Over there, we will see the velocity would
be u zero cosine omega t.
So, it has the same fluctuation as the
pressure.
In the words, as I am, as I, as I, as
I emphasized, the pressure and the velocity
as a same phase.
What about the intensity, p multiplied by
velocity?
Okay, this is a simple.
I multiply p and, velocity, that will be p
zero and u zero.
That's, it's the magnitude of intensity.
And I have cosine square omega t minus kx.
And cosine square alpha has some mean,
some
mean, some, some dc value, as, as you all
know.
And also the argument of cosine square
omega t, has to be doubled to two omega t.
So there's some dc value.
Then, then there's a sum fluctuation, in
this case omega t changed to two omega t.
So the important one is if there is no
reflection,
one dimensional case there, there is a
mean
intensity indicating that there is not
power
flow from, from, from this side to that
side.
And also fluctuating intensity is two
omega t.
So, frequency is changing, of course, that
is
very obvious, because we have a pressure
that
is proportionate to cosine omega t,
and
velocity is proportionate to cosine omega
t, too.
So, multiplication will induce two omega t
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Intensity is not linear function of a
pressure or velocity.
You have to be very careful.
Okay?
It is very natural, you have a doubling
frequency,
because p multiplied by u, is non linear
operation.
That's why when we handle intensity using
complex variable notation, you
have to be very careful, because it is non
linear operation in principle.
[BLANK_AUDIO].
Now, let's look at pressure and velocity
and intensity with respect to space.
So all this case observes intensity at
time t equals zero.
That instance of time when you start to
drive the fluid along x.
So, I am seeing pressure, velocity and
intensity along this axis.
Okay?
Then this means that I am doing spacial
observation.
Then what we observe is this,
because the mathematical expression
available over here.
What I do is I put t equals zero0.
Then I have a p zero cosine minus kx.
And a cosine minus alpha is the same as a
cosine alpha.
So I got this, pressure fluctuation.
And here this is x, okay, and a k
and omega there is a relation between k
and omega.
K has to be equal to omega over c.
And omega is 2 pi f.
And k is 2 pi over lambda.
So using that relation, you can see that
this is one half wavelengths and this is
one
wavelengths, and interestingly the
acoustic
intensity along space, is also double,
right?
And that has to be 2 kx instead of 1 kx.
Okay, it, also interesting in space, the
acoustic
power or intensity that has mean value, as
well as a fluctuating value.
So this is the result, when we have a
tube, one
dimensional case, a tube, that does not
have a reflection.
Okay?
What if you have, we have the perfect
reflection over here, at x equal L?
That is a perfect reflection.
Okay, if you have a perfect reflection
then this spacial reflector
phrasal solution that satisfied this
boundary condition, is simply that
there, there would be no velocity over
here at x equals L.
And the veloc, the pressure has to be
maximum at x equal L, right?
That's pretty much an intuitive
observation.
So, if we get a solution that gives us
maximum pressure at x equal L, then that
would have the form of cosine.
And then L minus x, because this form give
me when x equal L,
the cosine augment would be zero, and that
gives me x.
Why did I use L minus x extend of, instead
of using x minus L?
Physically, L minus x means I want to see
my position,
I want to see my, my position with respect
to L.
Okay, say L is one meter.
And I am, for example in the position x
equals seventy centimeters.
So what I see that, I see the physics
away from one meter, I mean
oh, oh, oh from 30 centimeter from one
meter at the boundary.
So I prefer to use this notation.
Okay, and then, because the, the this,
I mean, this solution will
satisfy also, the other solution like this
solution will satisfy.
Therefore, I employ the n pi over L over
here.
To express every possible solution, n can
be one to any value.
All right?
This L is just the scaling, the
distribution of sound pressure along this
length L.
Okay?
That has a physical meaning.
And then, of course, there should be some
time fluctuation component
that has to be exponential, e to the minus
j omega t, and the p zero, okay?
I will take real part of this solution.
So I'm arguing that this form satisfy
acoustic wave equation as well as boundary
condition.
Of course, I, I, I wrote down the solution
based on my intuition,
or our intuition that, because the
solution well expresses
the boundary condition, which means that
the the pressure
at xt, x equal L, has to be, has to be,
has to be maximum.
So now we have this solution.
That is pressure, and using Euler equation
again,
we can obtain the velocity solution like
that.
Okay, the velocity solution, rather
complicated,
compare with the infinite, infinite pipe
case.
Okay?
But if you look at some details about this
solution, okay, there is
a sine omega t and over there there is
cosine omega t.
Wow!
Compare with the previous case, time
fluctuation
of pressure and a time fluctuation of
velocity
time fluctuation of pressure is cosine of
omega t,time fluctuation of velocity
is a sine omega t, that means there is a
phase difference of 90 degree.
What it means physically?
When I drive the fluid, okay, like that,
then fluid does not respond in phase to
me.
But responds to me, respond to me with a
90, 90 degree phase difference.
Why?
Because we do know there's a different
boundary condition, rigid end, the fluid
is certainly rigist, or I would, I would
like to use the word react,
react to the force, to represented by,
by, by, boundary condition.
There's a certain reaction due to the
presence of boundary condition.
That means if I had a rigid end, when I
push
the fluid, there is a reaction from the
fluid to me.
That is interesting.
Let's look at another variation with
respect to space.
One is cosine, n pi over L, L minus x.
The other one is a sine, n pi over L, L
minus x.
Again, spatial distribution of pressure
and
velocity, one is cosine, the other is a
sine
again there is 90 degree phase difference.
Wow!
So, if we have a rigid end, and
when I drive the fluid pipe,
the whole fluid, whole fluid
with respect to time and space,
react to me, by having 90
degree phase difference.
So that means, when I measure pressure,
and then measure, when I measure
velocity, therefore I, I am able to
measure
intensity if the intensity, has this kind
of form.
In other words if the pressure and
velocity has 90 degree phase
difference, then I can say that oh, this
fluid is very reactive.
In other words, this fluid has certain
rigid end boundary condition.
On the other hand, if I have the pressure
and
velocity that has a same phase, then I can
anticipate
that oh, this fluid behave as if infinite
duct.
In between, if there is a boundary condition
which is, which is
compliant, have a certain compliance or
impedance,
then what I observe would be some here in
between, okay.
So let's look at some details about the
intensity distribution of finite ducts.
Okay, first one sees the intensity with
respect to time, but observing
at 7 L over, over 8, when n equal 1.
In other words, I am seeing the first
mode.
Then it look like that, and the velocity
look like that.
Obviously, this velocity and this pressure
has, as you can see right away.
There is 90 degree phase difference, okay?
And this is a highlight.
If you look at the pressure, a pressure
multiplied by velocity, that is the
intensity fluctuation.
Observing at this point, what you see is
the
fluctuating intensity that has a two omega
fluctuation, but
interesting, as you can see over there
there is no mean intensity,
zero, intensity, distribution with respect
to time.
What it means? It's not possible to pour
my energy
into the system because there is no mean
intensity.
Intensity is just a fluctuating with the
two omega in space, in time, right?
So, if we have a this kind of fluid
system, it's not
possible to pour my energy into this
system because
it is pretty perfectly reactive system,
alright?
So, similar behavior, you can obtain the
intensity with respect to space.
Let me generalize what I, what we observed
from here.
For example, for example, for example,
when
I whistle over here, [SOUND] 1 kHz sound,
okay?
And if you measure intensity over here, if
you measure intensity over
here, or if you measure intensity far away
from me, over there.
Far away from me as you can see in the
text in the previous lecture because
you are in a far field, the pressure and
the velocity has the same phase.
But if you measure intensity over here,
you will see there is a phase difference
between
pressure and velocity, and we call this
is, near field.
So in near field, pressure and velocity,
does not have a same phase.
It has some phase difference, and
therefore,
it is reactive, physically that is
imaginable.
Suppose we have a many, many fluid, fluid
particles.
Suppose you have small bubbles over here,
and I'm pushing the bubbles, by pressure.
Okay.
Because it has a certain curvature over
there, when I push this fluid particle
and that fluid particle at the same time,
this fluid particle
has to move the other fluid particle that
had more fluid particle.
Right?
Because it has certain curvature.
But in a far field, in a far field,
the curvature, I mean, the very front is
almost straight.
So the fluid particle over here will move
the same fluid particle, same amount of
fluid particle.
Therefore in a far field case, is the same
as
the pipe that does not have reflection
over
here, because I have to move more fluid
particle.
Then, then some fluid particle would move
as
if, I mean, move with no phase difference.
But some fluid particle will have a
certain phase difference, in other words a
reactive.
So in a near field, recall, the medium is
reactive.
And a far field medium is resistive.
I didn't explain about the resistive.
But resistive means that the intensity has
a
real part, and the other is average
intensity.
Or in other words, the pressure and the
velocity is in phase.
Then we call resistive.
