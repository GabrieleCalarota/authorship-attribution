So let me start the lecture number three
Review,

in the last lecture we talked about
one dimensional wave, 
typical one dimensional wave.
We,
we have been handle the waves in a
string.
The governing equation can be written like
that.
Here c_L square is a speed of propagation.
that is related with the string tension
divided by rho_L.
And typical one dimensional wave that
satisfied this governing equation,
wave equation can be written as g(x ?ct), 
plus h(x+ct),
as we learned g stands for the wave
in right going direction and h is stands
for the way for the left going direction.
And we found that,
also the characteristic impedance that
characterized of this medium in this case
that is rho_L c_L.
That is the characteristic impedance 
that define
the, the character or property of the wave
of propagating in the string, and also we
found that the driving point impedance
[INAUDIBLE]
for the for the wave
of infinite string case the same as the
characteristic impedance of the medium.
And also he found that driving point
impedance for finite case that has length
of L that is rho_L c_L, and the j is the
measure the
j is the j squared is equal to
-1 and the rest the part is
co-tangent kL.
And I emphasis that.
kL is a measure of the
measure of the scale of a finite scale
that is L, with the respect of wavelength
lambda.
Okay.
So essentially, the driving point
impedance drive how the
wave is propagating, for the
finite case that has a length of L.
And that is, totally depending
on the kL and, and the cotangent kL
and that that's what
we study in the last lecture.
And today we will see the
[SOUND].
Chapter,
We’ll go to chapter two, and then chapter two
has
to do with an acoustic wave equation and
its basic.
So we will move to acoustic wave equation.
And we will also learn about the basic
physical measures.
What it essentially means that we will
study acoustic wave equation and others.
We, we studied about one dimensional
string wave equations.
But now, we want to expand our
understanding to three dimensional acoustic waves.
And we want to study also, what would be
the basic physical, basic physical
measures that represent acoustic wave
equation, acoustic wave propagation.
Okay.
So, let me have very simple
demonstration
using this.
[SOUND]
[SOUND] Which is about 200 hertz
and, and you can, you can hear the sound
coming from this small bottle.
[SOUND] And
what you can imagine from this
demonstration, there will be some
oscillation.
of 200 or approximately 220 hertz;
therefore, by using very well-known, dispersion
relation,
we can see that the, the lambda of this
wave would be
[SOUND]
that is more
than, that is larger than what, one meter.
[SOUND]
The one meter wave is generated over and
then and appropriating into space.
So what, what is happening right, right
now is there is some compression.
The frequency of 220 hertz.
Okay?
So, compression induces some change,
pressure change.
Because there is a compression, there is a
density change.
Also because there is a the pressure
change,
and a density change, there is some change
of velocity of the fluid particle in the
neck.
So we can, we can imagine that the typical
physical measure would
be the density change and the pressure
change and the velocity change.
And note that the velocity is a vector
and the pressure is a scala and the density
is a scala.
So we are trying to understand how these
three
physical measures are inter-related each
other in this course.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Okay, first let's see simple case.
Again, we'd like to use one dimensional
case.
Let's look at small segment of this fluid,
one dimensional case.
Then we can imagine that would some force
acting on this
plane, say this is at x and this is x+dx 
And we can also easily anticipated the,
the force acting on this surface, x+dx
dx, would be pS plus
dps, dx, dx, using Taylor Expansion.
And this force will act on this
surface like that.
Because there is a force difference
acting on this mass, using Newton's second
law, we can say, this mass, that would be
rho times S.
That is the that is the
sorry.
And delta x, that would be the mass.
Okay, of, of this particle.
This mass will move with a certain [SOUND]
change of velocity,
okay.
That I could write,
the velocity change would be du dt
Okay.
Plus some term that is due to
convection.
Let's see what it is, what is this.
Okay, the velocity change
with the respect to time, has to be
written like that.
And, using chain rule, I can say is du dut,
plus,
they can not see.
So, I will write over there du/dx and
dx/dt.
Right?
And this term says how the velocity, 
how the movements of fluid particle in
x direction with respect to time.
And this is u.
So I can write du/dt, is, has two
contributions.
One is du/dt, plus.
and the other one is u times du/dx.
This is due to the convection of fluid
particle.
And this we call material derivative, so
D/Dt, again they can not see it so I will
move this section.
So D/Dt.
That is d/dt plus u d/dx.
That is material derivative
So first term, actually seeing the change
of velocity with respect to time, and the
second term is seeing the change of
velocity
as if I am riding on the fluid particle
As we call convection term.
But if you, if you cannot understand this
term, don't worry because we will
neglect this term later on because this is
contribute high order term.
But imagine.
envisage what it means.
So conclude as a result of this
derivation,
okay.
I can write that
okay there is pS.
That is a force acting on this side.
And minus ps plus dps, dx
,dx because there is a force
acting on this surface.
Okay that could be represented like that.
And that has to be equal to rho
times.
dx, as does the amount of mass that has
to be
accelerated due to the unbalanced force,
okay.
And then that has to be multiplied, du dt
plus u.
du dx.
Okay?
So what we can see that in,
in, in this, in this, in this
Newton's second law applied to
the junc of a fluid particle
gives us that there is minus
dps dx dx that has to be rho dx S du dt plus u
du dx.
So what I get is, taking out the common
term that is dx.
And cancel out dx.
So I have minus dp dx has to be equal to
rho time acceleration.
That is du dt plus u du dx so this is
very, this has the very
familiar form we learned when
we apply Newton's second law
on the fluid particle,
so what this means, physically means,
the, the this term is dp dx, okay.
That essentially says the
Force, I mean unbalanced force acting on this fluid particle.
So dp dx, what is dp dx?
Is rate of change of pressure with
respect to space, that makes sense.
The reason why we have minus over here.,is simply because the pressure acting on
this surface,
okay?
Incremental pressure change on this
surface has to
be toward this direction, therefore there
is minus.
Okay.
And that the other term is rho times 
dudt, and the u du dx.
And this term is due to
convention.
Okay, and notes that.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
I'll show this results.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And note that pressure has two components.
One is ambient pressure and access
pressure p’, acoustic pressure or so
when you, when you, when you, when you,
when you experience pressure over here.
There is ambient pressure, p0 or
atmospheric pressure.
And
then access pressure p’.
This we call
access pressure or
acoustic pressure
This is ambient
pressure.
Okay, and also the rho has a two
components.
There's rho0 plus rho’.
rho0 is a static, static constant
pressure.
And the rho’ is the density change
due to acoustic pressure.
Okay, okay.
When I excited this bottle.
[SOUND]
But before I excite a bottle there is only
rho0.
And p0, but I when excite rho’ p’
and note that
this equation only describes, of course, the
velocity U
velocity u, which we are considering is u’,
unless there is a mean flow.
If there is a mean flow, if
somebody blow
the air and then excite, then there is u0
plus u’
But if we think there is no such steady
velocity, then there is only u’, that
means
prime stands for everything related with
acoustics.
Okay, if you look at this equation, this
equation
only describes the, the relation p and
velocity u.
We need some equation therefore, that
relate pressure and density and velocity
and density.
So we need two more equation so that
we have complete description between
pressure, velocity and,
velocity and the density.
So this equation, we call Euler equation.
Euler equation.
Okay.
