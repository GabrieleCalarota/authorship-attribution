Last lecture, in the last lecture we
reviewed the
our sensation, I mean hearing
sensation system and
we also talked about the sound intensity.
And some pressure that the measure
that measured that measure associated
with some pressure is SPL in dB scale
and also we talked about the weighting and
a why
we have to consider the weighting for
example dBA scale
and also we introduced the frequency
scale, which you
use in acoustics or noise octave scale.
And
let us move our very classical problem
that we handled
for the case of a string.
When we have thin stream and thick
stream,
if the characteristics impedance of this
one is Z1, and Z2.
Applying the boundary condition over there
I used the
coordinate x, and the boundary condition
at x equals zero
would be velocity continuity and the force
continuity.
Then we found that the reflection
coefficient, which is simply the ratio
between
how much wave, how much wave is reflected
compared with
the incident wave that was expressed
by Z1 + Z2, Z1 - Z2, and
transmission coefficient,
we found that transmission
coefficient is Z1 plus Z2 and
the 2Z1.
Okay [COUGH] all right, and also we,
examine, the examine the
driving point impedance
for infinite string.
Then, this was rho L, cs, so cs is this.
The propagation speed of string and the
rho L is the density per unit x.
And then interestingly, if you have a
finite string,
then, then the driving point impedance for
finite string
is not same as this one but has imaginary
part, only
imaginary part and that is rho L cs and a
cotangent kL.
And
I think the you remember that I emphasize
the two things.
The one is,
for infinite case, deriving point impedance is
exactly same as the characteristic impedance
of medium.
That means, the, when I drive this,
this medium.
Because there is no phase difference
between
force and velocity, that means I can
effectively drive the system.
In this case, because impedance is force,
generally force over velocity.
In this case, because there is a
90 degree phase
difference, expressed by j, that
means there is always some reaction
from the medium, because again there is
phase difference.
And also it depends on kL.
And I emphasize the meaning of kL, kL if I
rewrite in terms
of wavelengths, that is two pi over
lambda, that is k.
Therefore, that is a measure of length scale
with respect to wavelengths.
So if wavelengths is very large, then
L over, L over lambda approach to small
value,
then cotangent kL approach to one
over kL because cotangent kL
is one over tangent kL and kL is very
small tangent kL approach to kL,
so this approach to kL.
So there are lots of interesting phenomena
associated
with this expression as well as that
expression.
Also, we
look at the impedance and impe, no, no,
no, intensity
and compared with the impedance, intensity
is pressure multiplied by velocity.
And that exhibits quite different
characteristics associated with medium.
Right, okay.
Let me then continue to
expand what we observed in one dimensional
string case, to a general acoustic medium.
Alright.
So let's consider for example, I have a
medium and I
have a characteristic impedance of this
medium is Z1.
And suppose I have incidence wave
because of the discrepancy or
discontinuity,
over here, there will be some reflection.
And I denote that this is P.
Sorry,
this is Pr, and this is Pi because this is
instance wave,
and there must be some transmitted wave
Pt, okay.
And what I'm going to show today is the,
for example reflection coefficient of
this case, and transmission coefficient of
this case is exactly same as this.
What you observe the for, for the one
dimensional string vibration case.
Okay, and then, I'll move the
understanding
based on this simple case to the case
when we have
mass, okay.
In this case, if I have incident wave, of
course, there
will be some reflection and there
will be some transmission.
Obviously, this case and this case
would be different because of the
difference of discontinuity.
And we would like to know how much where
would be
reflected, how much wave would be
transmitted, for this case.
And also we move on to the case when we
have
more general circumstances.
For example, I have wall,
but this wall has not only the mass, but
also spring and damping over there.
And again, we want to see how much
wave will be reflected
compare with the instance wave. And how
much a wave we were transmited.
[SOUND] Okay, and then we will, based on
this understanding,.
We will move to the case when we have a
wall that has a spring and damping,
but what if I have wall coming obliquely.
Now I want to see what's going to happen.
How much transmitted, how much reflected
and how
much, how much reflected and how much
transmitted?
What is the angle difference between
incident wave and the transmitted wave?
Okay, of course we will also talk about
how much wave will be
reflected and transmitted for this case,
and how much
wave reflected and transmitted for this
case, too.
okay?
So this is what we are going to handle in
chapter three.
The title of this chapter is waves on flat
surface of discontinuity.
And one would argue that this model is too
simplified.
For example, when we
have a plate, okay.
When we have
a plate when there is incident wave.
And the plate will vibrate or infinite
plate will generate wave.
And then there will be some reflection,
and
also there will be some transmission.
And the amount of reflection and the
amount
of transmission definitely dominated by
the characteristics of plate,
obviously plate means that it has a finite
bending rigidity.
In other words, there is some curvature
produced by the bending rigidity.
Therefore, it, it, how much reflected and
how much transmitted is, is, is, very much
depends on the mass of plate, as well as
the bending rigidity of plate,
okay?
Then, let me ask some simple question.

Suppose that you have the
same mass, and you
supposed to make a wall or
partition that can have
minimal transmission.
What would be your choice?
Do you like to have this kind of wall or
that kind of wall?
Okay,
it's not easy to think right away
But let me ask you again this question.
I have a wall over here, and I'm
saying, due to the, discontinuity
on this wall, there is some wave is
reflected and some wave is transmitted.
Why?
Why some wave is reflected and why some
wave is transmitted.
To, to, to figure out why, why this kind
of things happen.
The easiest way or convenient way
would be, I mean suppose
you are one of the fluid particle over
here.
Okay, everybody imagine that you are one
of the particle over there.
Then, what you will experience for this
case.
The wave is coming, this fluid particle
will compress, tnd then.

Back to the volume will, back to the
volume
as it was, and then expand and then
compress, again and again.
This will move this wall.
And this, because there is another fluid
particle, the moving of this wall would be,
you know,
opposed by the fluid of particle.
So actually, what happened is, when there
is a traveling wave, the fluid particle is
pulsating over here, and this fluid
particle is also pulsating, and this
wall will vibrate, over here, right.
So actually physically what happen is,
when there
is an incident wave, and the wall is
vibrating.
Because the wall is vibrating, there is a
radiation, due to the vibration of the
wall.
That radiation produces transmission and
the reflection,
therefore, therefore,
If you think how this plate will radiate
compared with this wall,
then you could have some good idea about
the transmission and reflection.
So, I am trying to trying to
connect, what I learn, what we learned
from this one
dimensional string case to three
dimensional
radiation problem, okay?
So that is our objective up to few weeks
from now.
So let us try to see what
we can, obtain for the
case of which we have
only, plane wave.
I mean this case.
let, let us start this case, okay?
Then let me write down this, Pi.
It has a magnitude of capital Pi,
and then for convenience lets use, use
exponential j,
okay, and
then I want to use minus j omega t minus
kx.
Okay, this form is easy to apply boundary
condition.
Because when x is zero this will give me
exponential minus
j omega t so we prefer this to boundary
condition.
So i can write this is also right going
wave, so I use capital Pt
which is complex magnitude and then, again
use exponential.
And I use minus j, omega t, minus kx,
And this, I cannot, this is Pr.
Let me use R, capital R, exponential minus
j, omega t.
And kx
over here that should be plus because it
is propagating in this direction, negative
x direction, okay?
I think everybody follow me.
Now our objective is to,
our objective is to find out what is R and
what is tau.
In terms of the variable we just employed.
Okay, including Z1 and Z2.
Okay,
now, let me ask you one question.
And this medium is Z1, and this medium,
the characteristic impedance of this
medium is Z2.
Can we, I
mean, do you think it is more general to
assume that this is
if this is omega and then this omega has
to be different or same?
Because we are handling linear system,
linear differential equation.
If I excite this system with omega1, then
this medium has to be excited with a same
omega,
right?
With that argument, we have, we can do
same omega.
What about the k?
What about the k?
Note that k is wave number, and that
is dispersion relationship, omega over c.
And omega has to be same, what about the
speed of propagation at each medium?
Okay. Speed of propagation depends on
the ratio between pressure and the
density.
In other words, how much pressure
is required for unit volume change and
depends on
medium. Right, therefore the c, speed of
propagation of this medium and the speed
of propagation of that medium has to be
different, therefore this k1 and this k
has to be different.
So I have to use k1 over here, and a k1
over here, k2 over here,
Okay?
That's very important.
So, so now we set up all the assumed
pressure field
in terms of all necessary variables.
