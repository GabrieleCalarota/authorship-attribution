Now we understood the basic physical
measures that have to do with acoustics.
Pressure, density, and the velocity
fluctuation
that are involved in acoustic wave
propagation.
Therefore, we are ready to apply what we
understood to the real basic problems.
As we did before, let's begin with
inviting
some very simple but practically useful case.
case.
For example, that I make some
sound like one kilohertz [SOUND].
Then if there is no obstacle in front of
this sound,
then the sound will propagate and everyone
can hear.
Well what if I have this kind of flat
discontinuity, or flat object in front of
the sound?
Then, obviously, some sound will be
reflected and transmitted.
Essentially, as we understood, but in
terms of driving
point impedance, actually this obstacle
will vibrate,
due to the excitation of the incoming
wave, to the surface.
So extending what we understood by using
the
driving point impedance, we'll talk
about
what's going to happen, when the wave
meets
this kind of flat surface of
discontinuity.
Surprisingly this, the understanding based
on this kind of discontinuity
will provide us a very interesting
and practically useful application.
For example, if you want to design some
wall, so that we can
cut off the noise coming from the place
where we do not want.
Then, the understanding based on this kind
of simple flat surface of this continuity
case, would provide us the interesting and
practically useful result.
Normally, the fundamental concept related
with the flat surface
of discontinent can be summarized by
introducing "mass law".
Mass law simply says the, what is
transmitted
due to the flat surface of discontinuity.
There's many controlled by mass per unit
area, of this flat surface.
And you will enjoy, how to use mass law
for practical case.
