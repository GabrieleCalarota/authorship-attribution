In this segment, we introduce the
classical restoration problem.
According to it, there is a system between
the original
and the acquired image, which introduces
some type of degradation.
The system can represent the Hubble space
telescope, or the turbulent atmosphere.
Or be a combination of the motion of an
object in the scene, and the motion of the
camera.
When the degradation system is linear and
spatially invariant.
The both the modeling of the degradation
and its removal, are, relatively speaking
simplified problems.
We show the mathematical models for the
systems, introducing some of the common
encountered LSI degradations, of course
there's almost
always the ever present noise in the data
as part of the degradation.
We show how is the severity of noise
typically measured in image restoration.
As well as an objective metric used
for estimating the improvement in the
restored image.
When a synthetic experiment is conducted.
Of the recovery problems we described,
such as concealment and painting,
resolution.
They have a common structure, they're all
inverse problems.
So, we assume there is a system, which you
denote here by H, that takes
an image at the input F, and produces an
image G at it's output.
And it could be a single image or multiple
images or a video.
When we observe G,
and or solving for F,
it's a recovery and
inverse problem.
If only G is known, and still the
objective is to recover F,
and of course H along the way, then
becomes a blind recovery problem.
And the in between situation is when G is
observed, and H is partially known.
So the shape may be of age is known, and
but the, the [INAUDIBLE] but
the width of the [INAUDIBLE] is not known,
so there's a parameter I need to estimate.
And in that case, it's referred to a semi
blind recovery problem.
Although the main objective is again, to
estimate
F as we'll see in a number of examples.
There are a number of parameters that are
introduced and they need to be estimated,
as well.
If f and g are known, and the objective is
to find h.
Then this becomes a system identification
problem and if f and h are known, and.
The motion estimation problem is an
inverse problem.
The disparate estimation, I just mentioned
it in passing at some point, it's also an
inverse problem, and the bounded detection
through
differentiation can be formulated as an
inverse problem.
So inverse problems are encountered are
all over the place.
It's a topic in Applied Math that he has
seen a lot of activity
for the long past and it's a very rich
literature.
There are numerous techniques that can be
utilized to solve such inverse problems.
The adaptivity on restoration was a result
of the space race
between the US and former Soviet Union in
the 50s and 60s.
So for example, the 22 images produced
during the
Mariner IV flight to
Mars in 64, cost them
million dollars so
this were is the case with most area
the activity comes in waves.
It's driven, for example, by mishaps, such
as the Hubble space telescope mishap, new
applications,
such as the super resolution of images and
videos for these huge ultra high
definition displays.
And, by new mathematical developments, and
sparsity of course the one
that stands out and we'll talk about it at
a later point.
Restoration has seen some not alright in
the media.
There's a brother field of the
assassination
of JFK, underwent a number of
restorations.
And then in a number of movies such as no
way out and rising sun, the whole plot
relies on the successful restoration of
some surveillance video.
Let us look now at the components of a
degradation restoration system.
F is the original input, image.
Is input to the degradation system H.
Noise is added to the output of a system,
and this gives rise to the observation Y.
So, here's how the input looks, it's an
aerial shot, and here's
the blurred version of this by H, plus the
addition of noise.
So the objective of restoration is to
design a system r, which will
operate on the observation y, and give us
an estimate, of the original image f hat.
That will be as close as possible to
the original one, subject to the optimal
criterion.
In carrying out this restoration step, we
assume that we
have perfect knowledge of h this is the
nonblind version.
Then we also need to know the noise
statistics, and
here there's a double sided arrow, or
arrows going in and out from our.
To indicate that these statistics can be
updated
based on the partially restored image, for
example.
And another component which is extremely
critical when it comes
to restoration, is prior knowledge on f,
on the original image.
And this prior knowledge can be expressed
in various ways
and we'll see examples of that as we
proceed here.
But it's also important that we are able
to incorporate such, such
prior knowledge in a rather straight
forward way into the Restoration Filter.
Wnd again there are two arrows,.
Going, towards and away from this prior
knowledge box to indicate
again that this prior knowledge can be
updated as the iteration progresses.
Now, the noise statistics can be given to
us which is idealistic or in most cases
we measure them, let's say the noise
variance
under a Gaussian assumption from the
available data y.
Similarly if h is not known, then it needs
to be estimated from the available data y.
This is referred with a blur
identification
problem and in carrying out such a
step, it's also important that we have
some prior knowledge on the properties of
h.
So you do see here all the components
that are involved in designing a
Restoration system.
Again, prior knowledge is of the utmost
importance since it restrains the solution
set.
And produces an estimate here of that is
as close as possible to the original image
f.
As it became clear from the previously
slide in carrying out the striation,
that blur is needed and knowledge estimate
is needed if they're not known, then.
There the steps of blur identification,
noise estimation, and restoration that
that involve.
And these three steps can be
done independently, using any technique of
choice.
However, at least conceptually, it should
be clear
that if their done at the same time,
simultaneously.
And by that I mean that an error
in identifying the blur is taken into
account when
the noise is estimated, and this error is
taken into account when the restoration is
carried out.
Then one should expect improved results.
Stochastic methods, we'll talk about them
a little bit of their,
an advantage of that nature, that all
these steps can be.
Taken, simultaneously.
And again, repeating here, prior knowledge
on all the unknowns.
H, f, and n is of the out most importance
in providing a solution here,
f hat, that is, as, as close as possible
to the original image we're after.
So translating the operations shown by the
block diagram into an equation
here we have the observed image y i j is
the result of the
application of this operator of this
system h onto
the original image plus the noise that has
been added.
So this is a very generic, general model
that can be found in very many different
applications.
So the problem at hand is, given y, and
given knowledge of H, we try to find
an estimate of f and, of course, knowing
the statistics about the noise.
So this is the Restoration problem.
[SOUND]
Now, in many applications, this system can
be well approximated by linear
and Spatial Invariant system and noise of
course additive, and signal dependent.
And then as we know by now, in this case,
the operation of
H on f is given by the familiar two
dimensional convolution.
So the output, the observed image is the
convolution of the input with the impulse
response
of the LSI system plus noise, and here
is the expression for the two dimensional
convolution.
So in this particular incarnation, solving
for F, given the impulse
response of the system, and the available
data, becomes now a deconvolution.
Deconstruction
problem.
The system convolves, and the inverse
problem we're solving is to
deconvolve the operation of the system,
undo what the system did.
So restoration is a more general term,
applies to this general equation, if
the system again introducing degradation
is
LSI, then I'm solving de convulsion
problem.
We show here that impulses sponsor some
of the most commonly encountered
degradation systems.
So if the degradation is due to one
dimensional
motion between the camera and the scene,
so the object
in the scene move on a plane that is
parallel to the camera plane this is a D
plane.
And then they move in a horizontal
direction, then
here is the impulse response of this
degradation system.
So here's this shape.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
And here we assume that l is an even
number so l over two is an integer.
The extension of this is if the motion
is at an angle, not along the horizontal
direction
but at an arbitrary angle theta, and
that's also
something that can be handled with not
major difficulty.
If the distortion is due to atmospheric
turbulence, then the
long term exposure through the atmosphere
is modelled like this.
This impulse is responsible for the
Degradation system, so this,
this ocean here controlled by the variants
of the ocean.
If it's an out of focus Degradation, then
this disc,
in two dimensions, i, j, is, represents
the impulse response of
the system, so it's a function of the
severity of a,
the focusing is a function of the radius
of this disc.
And finally the Pill-box distortion is
kind of the extension
of the one demotion so it square here
from minus element two clone.
Two in both dimensions and again l in this
particular case is
assumed to be an even number so that l
over two is an integer.
So well be making use in some examples so
some of these Degradations.
But there again can be found in the
literature there rather widely used.
In the image restoration community, in
assessing
the quality of the degraded image, we
utilize not the signal to noise ration,
but the blurred, signal to noise ratio
instead.
So here's the model we've been using, the
Degradation model, the observed image
is the convolution of F with impulse
response of the system plus noise.
So if we called the Blurred Image here
GIJ, then in the num,
numerator you see the variance of G bar is
the mean or expected value of b.
We assume the image has m times n pixels.
Therefore, the numerator is the variance
of the blurred signal
and then the denominator is the variance
of the noise.
In assessing the quality of the restored
image for simulation situations where the
original
image is available we use this ISNR matrix
improvement in signal to noise ratio.
So in the b term log base 10 in the
denominator of this fraction
we'll put the difference the square there
between the original f is the original.
Which, again, in a simulation environment
is available and f hat
is the restored, so the distance between
the original they restored.
So, that's the error in the estimation and
in the
numerator is the quantity f, the original
minus y, the observation.
So this arrow squared.
So these are two quantities that we will
be utilizing for the
rest of this presentation restoration,
Blurred
Signal-to-Noise Ratio and improvement in
Signal-to-Noise Ratio.
