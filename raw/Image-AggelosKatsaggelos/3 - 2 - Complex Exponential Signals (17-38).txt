Welcome back, in this segment we will
introduce a two dimensional complex
exponential signal.
It's the extension of the one dimensional
complex exponential.
It is of course nothing else, than a
cosine for
a real part and the sine for its imaginary
part.
Complex exponentials are probably the most
important signals in signal processing.
They go through LSI's systems with their
frequencies unchanged, and they're
the building blocks of any signal, as
we'll see in week three.
The periodicity property also is
responsible in determining what
constitutes low
and high frequencies in the normalized
frequency spectrum of a digital signal.
The two dimensional cosine also an
important
signal since evaluated at various
frequencies it forms.
The set of bases over transformation.
The discrete cosine transfer or DCT which
is widely used in image and
video compression as we will see in detail
in weeks nine and ten.
The basic idea when the DCT is used
for compression is that it de-correlates
the data.
Each of the DCT coefficients contains
information
that none of the other coefficient
contain.
Now, some of the coefficients contain a
lot of information.
Or as we say, the image of the signal is
compacted in a few coefficients.
While other coefficients contain very
little information.
And therefore, they can be discarded or
coursely quantized without much loss of
information.
So, let us look at the specific details of
the complex exponential.
>> Complex exponentials are very important
signals in digital signal processing.
Here we see the two dimensional complex
exponential at frequencies omega one,
omega two.
They're important for at least two
reasons.
The first one is that they're Eigen
functions of linear and spatial invariant
systems.
Don't worry about the details, the fine
details
at this point, we'll talk about it later.
But what this means is that if I have an
LSI system, that's a system that is
both linear and spatially invariant, and
put at the input, at its input a complex
exponential like this one, j omega 1 n1
plus j omega 2 n2.
Then the same complex exponential will
appear as the output of the system.
So this complex exponential simply go
through this linear and special invariant
systems.
With a possible change of the amplitude,
that will become
let's say a, and the possible addition of
a phase.
With phase shift.
And the second important property is that
this
complex exponentials are the building
blocks of any signal.
As you'll see later I can write any
signal as a weighted sum of this complex
exponentials.
Now, another form to describe this complex
exponentials is with this formula
attributed to Euler.
[SOUND]
So into the j omega 1 n 1, into the j
omega 2 n 2 is the polar
representation of this complex signal and
this is equal
to cosine of the argument plus j sign of
the argument and does
the Cartesian representation of the
complex function
the real part and the marginal part.
It should be clear looking at either of
the polar of the Cartesian presentation
that the magnitude of this complex
exponential, each one of them actually is,
equal to 1.
Right from the Cartesian is cosine squared
plus sine squared and that's equal to 1.
The first question we want to address
here, the first property we want to
examine, examine is the periodicity
[SOUND]
of this complex exponential with respect
to the frequency, omega-1, omega-2.
As it's straightforward to see here.
These complex exponentials are periodic
with respect
to frequency with period 2pi in both
directions, 2pi in the omega one direction
and 2pi in the omega two direction.
So, if we simply write e to the j omega 1
plus 2pi,
[SOUND] n1 and the j omega 2 plus
2 pi n2, then this is clearly equal to, I
just
break it down to this 1.
Right?
And if I look at this guy here, it's a
cosine plus sine, cosine 2pi n1, n1 is an
integer.
So, it's a cosine of an integer multiple
of 2pi, which is equal to 1.
And the sine of integer multiple of 2pi is
0.
Therefore, this is equal to 1, and so is
this.
And this is equal to [SOUND].
To this, alright?
So this is just the, the proof, if you
wish, that indeed, the two-dimensional
complex exponential is periodic with
respect to
frequency, with period 2pi in both the
actions.
This same property, actually everything I
just mentioned
in this slide with respect to the
two-dimensional
complex exponential holds true for the
one-dimensional complex
exponential or the three-dimensional,
multi-dimensional in general complex
exponential.
Let us look now at the periodicity of this
two-dimensional
complex exponential with respect to the
spatial coordinates, n1 and n2.
So the question is, is the complex
exponential
always periodic with respect to n1 and n2.
So if it were periodic, [SOUND]
with periods, N1,
N2, then this equality should hold true.
Whenever n1, if we substitute n1 plus
capital N1,
and whenever n2, if we substitute n2 plus
capital N2, and
if it were periodic, this should be equal
to E
to the J omega1, N1, E to the J omega2,
N2.
Right?
So the questions other words is, to, can I
always
find the capital N1, capital N2, so this
equality holds true.
Well let's see.
If we just expand this, [SOUND] or break
it down to its components.
I have this for the first exponential,
it's the j omega
2 and 2 times to the j omega 2 n 2.
And this is equal to this.
[SOUND]
Now
this cancel out with, cancels out with
this, and this one cancels out with this.
Therefore, what I'm left with is, that
this should hold true.
[SOUND]
[SOUND]
And from this I should have that omega 1,
n 1 as an integer multiple of 2 pi.
And that omega 2, n2 should be an
integer multiple of pi with another
integer here, right?
So therefore from here, capital N1 is
equal to k1
2pi over Omega 1 while capital N2
is should be equal to k 2pi over omega 2.
Clearly n1 is an integer, k1 is an
integer, therefore for this equality to
hold true, 2 pi over omega 1 should be a
rational [SOUND]
number.
[SOUND] That is the ratio of two integers,
p over q.
Right?
[SOUND]
And the same should hold
true for this one so this should also be a
rational number p over q, right?
So this is what the analysis tells us,
right?
As long as 2pi over omega 1 and 2 pi over
omega 2 are rational numbers, then I can
always find a N1 and a N2 so that the
two-dimensional complex exponential is
periodic with respect to N1, N2.
Right?
So that's what we should keep in mind.
So just for, and one dimensional or let's
say a two dimensional thing
I have e to the j 3 n1 times
e to the j 4 n2, then here's omega
1 is right from here omega 1 equals 3.
Omega 2 equals 4 and therefore 2 pi over
omega
1 equals 2 pi over 3, therefore, which is
not a rational number.
And the same is true for 2pi o, over omega
2.
Therefore, this two dimensional complex
exponential is
not periodic with respect to n1 and 2.
And this analysis here again, calls
through
for one dimensional discrete complex
exponential signals.
Three-dimensional, four-dimensional,
multi-dimensional
complex exponents in general.
So, in summary, what we have seen in the
last two slides is that unlike
the continuous time complex exponential
which are always periodic
in the time or spatial domain and not
periodic in the frequency domain.
The discrete time complex exponentials are
periodic in the frequency domain and may
or may not be periodic in the spatial or
time domain as we just saw right here.
To illustrate the previous 2 properties of
a discrete cosine we show here an
1 dimensional cosine function cosine omega
n for values, values of a frequency omega.
Now, omega, in all cases, involves pi
therefore,
this cosine is periodic in the time
domain.
Time is the horizontal axis.
So discrete time, m, right?
So, for example, here, for omega equals pi
over 8, the period is
2pi over omega, which is equal to 16.
The period here is equal to 8, equal to 4,
equal to 2 and so on.
So the period keeps decreasing as you move
to the right, therefore the frequency
keeps increasing.
So for omega equals 0.
Cosine of 0 is equal to 1.
This is the signal that does not have any
other frequency other than the 0
frequency, the busy signal where omega
equals
pi over 8 we that the frequency increases.
We see, right from here to here, is one
period of the signal.
5 over 4 keep increasing and omega equals
pi this is the
highest possible frequency of the discrete
cosine.
And as a matter of fact cosine pi m equals
to minus 1 to the n.
So the values of the signal keep
alternating.
It switches from 1 to minus 1 and back to
1 and so on.
So this is the highest possible variation
of the signal.
Now as the frequency keeps incre,
increasing
from omega plus pi to 2 pi, right?
We see that the frequency of the variation
of the cosine keeps decreasing.
As a matter of fact this and this signal
is identical,
because 3 pi over 2, plus pi over 2,
equals 2 pi.
So these are two complementary angles and
cosine of
pi over 2 equals cosine of 2 pi minus pi
over 2 which equals 3 pi over 2, right?
So generally I have cosine a equals cosine
of 2 pi minus a.
Alright?
And similarly, these two are the same
signals and these two are the same
signals.
So the, this particular discrete cosine is
periodic the
time domain because we chose the frequency
omega carefully.
And then the other properties that this
discrete cosine is periodic in the
frequency domain with, with its, with
frequency periodic with period 2pi.
And therefore the range of frequencies
that this
cosine can change are from zero to pi.
Zero is the, the lowest frequency pi is
the highest frequency, I move to two pi,
keep
decreasing the frequency, and then omega
equals 2 pi,
cosine of 2 pi is also equal to 1.
This is the constant signal equals the
cosine at zero here.
I've completed the full a full period that
way in the frequency domain.
Similarly to the previous slide, we show
here the values of the three-dimensional
cosine, cosine
omega1 and 1 plus omega2 and 2, for
various values of the frequencies omega1
and omega2.
So we can see that the frequency's 0 pi
over 8, pi over 4, pi over 2 and pi.
And since pi is involved, the resulting
cosine is periodic in the spatial domain.
Instead of showing it as a 3D plot, we
show this
cosine as a two dimensional gray scale
image where white
corresponds to the value one, black to the
value
minus 1 and grey to the value 0.
The axis are, should have
this orientation shown here and each of
these blocks is an eight by eight block.
Okay?
So if we look at this image for example,
then, this shows cosine 0 and 1 plus
0 and 2, so cosine 0 is 1, so this a
constant D merged with the value of 1.
If we look at the first row here of
images, then they all have
omega one zero, [SOUND]
so therefore they show
cosine omega two n two for various values
of omega two.
If I look, for example at this image here,
then,
this is an image of cosine pi over 2 and
2, right?
For this particular round the, the period
is 2 pi
over pi over 2 equals 4 pixels or 4
samples.
Right?
So if I take one line of this image.
And see how it looks.
Then, we see that there's a value of one,
followed by value of
zero, followed by the value of minus 1,
followed by the value of zero.
So this is one period of the cosine pi
over 2 n 2.
And since this cosine is independent of
the value of n1 it means that for all
n1s the same value of this cosine will
be through therefore you see this vertical
stripes right?
It's the one pixel white so all these
values for example here are equal to 1.
And if I look also at this cosine, this
represents cosine
pi n2, which is, which as we saw, is equal
to minus one to the
n2, so this is the highest cosine in the
n2 direction.
I have one and minus one out of [UNKNOWN].
And if I finally look at this cosine here,
this is cosine pi n1 plus pi n2.
And you can easily verify that this is
equal
to minus 1 to the n1, minus1 to the n2.
So clearly the pixels ultimate between
minus 1 and 1,
and this is the highest two-dimensional
cosine that uh,we can have.
We are going to encounter these images
later
on in the course going to talk about
compression.
This will be the basis function signals of
the discrete cosine drafts form which
we will use to correlate data in
JPG as well as in media
