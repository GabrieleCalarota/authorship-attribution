[BLANK_AUDIO]
Welcome back.
I hope you enjoyed the first two weeks of
class.
As I mentioned at the beginning of last
week, in these two
weeks, weeks two and three, we'll
cover the fundamentals of two-dimensional
signal systems.
Last week, we get this analysis in the
spatial domain.
While this week we move to the frequency
domain.
We use two-dimensional sequencing systems
in our presentation.
However, all the information we provide
is also applicable to one-dimensional
signals.
But those at the higher dimensional
signals that is multidimensional signals
in general.
Thanks to Joseph Fourier, who lived in the
late 18th, early 19th century, we can
describe any
signal of any dimensionality, and the
operations of any
linear and spatially invariant system in
the frequency domain.
The frequency domain is mostly familiar to
us when we refer to one-dimensional
signals.
For example, we can distinguish between a
baritone and the
soprano or between low and high
frequencies in a music piece.
Images have similarly low and high
frequencies, which
you cannot hear, of course, but we can
see.
They're spacial frequencies.
We'll get familiar with the concept first
and then we will take the material
and the operations of [UNKNOWN] systems we
learned last week to the frequency domain.
We'll also understand what is involved
when
we convert the continuous signal to
discrete signal.
What we called in week one sampling.
And also when we changed the size of an
image When for example we
want to display a large image on a small
screen, of our cell phone.
Or a thumbnail image on a large screen.
And this is called sample grade
conversion.
Equipped with this material you can
understand what will follow in this class.
But also when you are interested in
learning new material outside this class.
As for example, what's the process of
acquiring an MRI image?
Or an x ray image of a
slice of a patient's body using
computerized tomography.
It's in fact to a CT or CT scan, a term
you might have heard before.
In this first segment we'll define the two
dimensional
continuous Fourier transform of a two
dimensional discrete signal.
And we will discuss some of its important
properties.
We will then work out a number of examples
which will give us a
good understanding of what constitutes a
low
pass and what constitutes a high pass
filter.
We'll finally talk about the important
convolution theorem which states that the
convolution
operation in the special domain becomes
a multiplication operation in the
frequency domain.
So, let us start covering this important
material.
Let us go see the linear especially in
variance system with impulses response h,
n1 and 2.
We put in signal x as it's input and
signal's a
complex exponential with specific
frequencies omega 1 prime, omega 2 prime.
This is a two dimensional Q tone, since it
only
contains again this particular frequency,
omega 1 prime, omega 2 prime.
We want to find out what the output of
the LSI system for this particular input
is equal to.
I did mention at some earlier point in the
course that these complex exponentials are
Eigenfunctions of LSI systems.
Which simply means that such complex
exponentials go
through the system without their
frequencies being altered.
Of course by now we know how to find the
output of an LSI system.
Its y n 1 and 2 is equal to the
convolution
of the input to the system with the
system's input response.
[SOUND] If I apply directly the definition
of the
convolution this is equal to this double
sum.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Again.
I just applied the diffusion of the
revolution.
Now we see that these terms.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Are independent of K1 K2.
Therefore they can come outside the
summation, and
all I'm left with these are these terms
here.
[SOUND] So we see that the complex
exponentials appear at
the output of the system.
They just went through the system.
And this term here tells me how the system
responded
to this particular complex exponential of
this come, at this specific frequencies.
This here is a complex quantity.
It has a [UNKNOWN] phase.
And we see that the LSI system is able to
discriminate among sinusoidal systems on
the basis of their frequencies.
So if the magnitude of this term here is
equal to one, then the
sign [INAUDIBLE], goes through the system
unchanged, while on the other
hand, if the money is equal to zero, the
complex [INAUDIBLE] is rejected
by the system, so therefore this is the,
[INAUDIBLE] of the LSI system.
With [INAUDIBLE] h, n 1 and 2 at these
frequencies omega 1 prime,
omega 2 prime are denoted by capital H,
omega 1 prime, omega
2 prime and this is the frequency that
responds to the system.
Now since this resolve is not going to
change, if I consider additional
frequencies, let's say omega one double
prime, omega 2 double prime,
we have that this is again the response of
the system frequency
and this capital H, omega 1 and omega 2 is
the fully transform of
the impulse response of the system H and 1
and 2 were
going to say cause there will be more
things about the fourier transfer in the
next slides.
We show here the two dimension of fourier
transform pair.
This is here the expression for the
forward
transform that will take an image from the
special domain and map it to the frequency
domain where omega 1, omega 2 continues of
variables.
So x omega 1, omega 2 is the two
dimensional fourier
transform or the spectrum of the image x
n1 and 2.
This is the expression of the inverse
fourier transform that will
take us from the frequency domain back to
the spatial domain.
We see with the expression on top that
even
when the image is real as it's usually the
case.
The fourier transform is complex due to
the presence of this complex exponentials.
Therefore, it [UNKNOWN] I can show the
magnitude and the phase of the fourier
transform.
And this represents the polar
representation of a complex number.
Or equivalently I can show the real.
And the marginal parts.
I see here in the expression for
[INAUDIBLE]
fourier transform between the grade for
minus pi
to pi in the omega 1 and minus pi to pi in
the omega 2 directions.
And this is due to the first property of
the fourier transform that it
is periodic With periods 2 pi, 2 pi, in
the omega 1, omega 2 directions.
This is a straightforward expression to
show, in essence,
we showed it when we started the complex
exponentials, we
saw that they're periodic with period 2
pi, 2
pi, and this is what gives rise to this
property.
Another useful property is To consider
what happens, when I
shift the image by amounts m 1, m 2 in the
special domain.
And what happens in the frequency domain
is I get the
spectrum of the signal, but it's
multiplied by this complex exponential.
So since the magnitude of the complex
exponential
is one, the magnitude of the shifted image
has not changed But I have this linear
face component that, is due to the spatial
shift.
The reciprocal of this property is the
modulation
property that, tells me what happens if I
shift the spectrum by 31, 32.
So similarly, I see that I have
this complex exponential appearing in the
special domain.
Another use for property is this which
is typically the [UNKNOWN] property which
tells us
that when the signal is real, then the
magnitude of the Fourier Transfer has even
symmetry.
While the phase of the Fourier Transform
has odd symmetry.
And finally this is the Parseval's
relational theorem which tells me that the
energy of the
signal, which is found according to this
expression in the
spacial domain Can also be found in the
frequency domain
by integrating over one period to pi, to
pi this energy
density
spectrum.
There are clearly additional properties,
quite a few of them, that one can find in
a standard image processing textbook, but
these are some of the more useful ones.
Let us consider a simple example.
We are given a system with an impulse
response depicted here.
And we want to find the frequency response
of this system.
So, we apply the definition of the Fourier
transform
and the frequency response is equal to
this double summation
[BLANK_AUDIO]
[SOUND] h n1, n2, e to
the minus j omega1 n1, e to the minus j
omega2 n2.
Now for the given impulse response, you
see that we have only five samples.
So we have the.
H minus 1 0 sample.
h 0 0, h 1 0,
h 0 minus 1 and h 0 1.
So out of this infinite sum, I only have
these five terms.
So h 0 0, multiplied by e to
the Minus J zero which is one plus
H minus one zero multiplied by this term
[INAUDIBLE]
[SOUND]
And
now I substitute the, I substitute the
given values of h.
So this is one-third and all the rest are
one-sixth.
[SOUND]
So equal
to 1 3rd.
Now we will observe here that due to
Euler's formula, e to the plus j omega
one, plus e to the minus j omega 1 will
give me two times cosine omega,
and similarly, the other two terms will
give me two
times cosine omega 2, and they can further
simplify this as.
1/3, 1 plus cosine omega 1, plus cosine
omega 2.
So we see that, for this particular
example,
the frequency response of the system is
3l.
This should come as no surprise, since one
of the propositions of the Fourier
transform is that if the signal has
even symmetry Then the fullier transfer is
real.
This means that the magnitude is the
absolute value of the stem, and therefore
the phase is zero at both frequencies
except when the stem here
becomes negative, in which case I have a
plus or minus pi phase jumps, hence
minus one has absolute value one And phase
plus minus five.
So lets see how this frequency response
looks like.
So I brought there the magnitude on the
vertical axis and they show it over
period the mega 1 for minus pi to pi and
the mega to for minus pi to pi.
This actual magnitude has even symmetry,
which is also, should come as
no surprise, because we saw in the
previous slide that one of
the properties of the Fourier transform is
that if the signal is
real, then the magnitude has even
symmetry, and the phase odd symmetry.
So if I look at this magnitude, I see that
H Zero, zero is equal to one, right.
Cosign zero is one so you have three over
three.
And also you observe that at
certain frequencies the magnitude becomes
exactly zero.
So for example if I look at the frequency,
mine was pie.
Pi over 2.
I have 1 plus cosine minus pi, which is
minus 1, so they cancel out, 0.
Plus cosine of pi over 2, which is 0.
And therefore this is 0.
This is actually the frequency over here,
right?
So by and large, this is a low pass
filter.
Is passes the 0, 0 frequency unchanged.
Attenuate slightly the low frequencies,
but as
the frequencies increase, the continuation
becomes, greater.
We show here, and example similar to the
previous one, where given the
impulse response of a system, and
well distributed to find its frequency
response.
The Form that h n 1 and 2 is the depicted
slightly different
from the previous case and shown here as a
3 by 3 matrix.
It should be understood that this is the h
0 0 sample.
This one, the h 1 1, while let's say, this
one is Is the h minus 1, 1, and so forth.
This actually approximates a Gaussian
shaped
function in this three by three window.
After a point, when you look at this
impulse
response which is again, is symmetric, has
even symmetry.
One should be able to identify terms in
the frequency response, so for example,
this and this
term, should give rise in the frequency
response of
a 2 times cosine omega 1 times the
coefficient
while the diagonal terms This term and
this term should
give rise to a term like this in the
frequency response.
2 times cosine omega 1 plus omega 2.
So if you work out the example you should
find out
that this is the frequency response of
this system as shown here.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
It's again, a real signal which should
come as
no surprise because hn1 and 2 shares even
symmetry.
If we plot the magnitude of the stem It
looks like this.
Here a plot of the vertical axis that 10
times log base 10 of the magnitude, so
one can see more clearly small values of
the magnitude of the frequency response.
Again, if I look at H(0,0) this is the sum
of
the values of the impulse response and
they sum up to 1.
And therefore, the logarithm of this value
is equal to zero.
So this term here, that's the zero, zero,
it's equal to zero.
We'll see again that this is a low pass
filter.
It, Attenuates slightly the low
frequencies and considerably the higher
frequencies.
And of course the zero zero frequency goes
through the system unchanged of, of the
input signal.
Here's a final example.
We're given a system with impulses
[UNKNOWN] depicted
here And, we're going to find its
frequency responds.
The comments I made earlier apply here as
well.
So this is the eight zero zero sample.
We see actually that this simple response
differs
in some sense from the previous ones in
the sense that I take differences now
between
the center Sample here nine in the
neighboring sample.
So we should expect that the shape of the
frequency response should be different.
So following exactly the same steps that
we
followed in the previous two examples one
can
find that the frequency response of this
filter
of this to the system is shown here.
Its real again because h(n1,n2) has even
symmetry If I plot this.
So I plot here the magnitude in the
vertical dimension and I plot again the 10
log 10 magnitude so that I am able to see
smaller difference.
Anylsis.
We see that now the shape is different in
the sense
that the low frequencies are attenuated
while the high frequencies are amplified.
We can easily that the h 0 0 is equal to
1, and therefore the log of this Is equal
to zero.
While if I look at, some frequencies.
For example, the h 0 pi frequency, which
is the frequency over here.
This is equal to 13, while the H pi pi is
equal to nine.
So, considerably higher values than 1 at
high frequencies and small values At zero.
Again low frequencies are attenuated, high
frequencies are amplified
high special frequencies and [UNKNOWN] are
represented by the edges.
Therefore the edges are allowed to go
through the
system while the flat regions are rejected
or greatly attenuated.
And therefore, a filter like this performs
edge detection on an image.
One of the important properties of the
Fourier transform is
the convolution property, or, as also
referred to, the convolution theorem.
It describes the input output
relationships of
an LSI system in the frequency domain.
So given a system with impulse points h,
and x in, the input, y, the output,
we know that, the input output
relationships in
the spatial domain are through the to the
convolutions.
So, the output equals the convolution of
the input with impulse response of the
system.
Clearly, I can take each of these
quantities through the frequency domain.
So I can find the spectrum of the signal.
I can find the fully transform of the
impulse
response, which is the frequency response
of the system.
And I can find the fully transform of the
output signal.
Since the signals are clearly related in
the spatial domain
one expects that they should be related in
the frequency domain.
And what the Convolution Theorem tells us
is
that indeed the spectrum of the output
signal
equals the spectrum of the input signal
times
multiplied by the frequency response of
the system.
So convolution in the spatial domain
becomes multiplication.
The frequency domain, and actually the
reverse is also true.
Multiplication, the time domain, becomes
convolution in the [UNKNOWN] domain.
Of course, here, we have to talk
about periodic convolution since the
signals are periodic.
So, let's see that indeed, this is the
case.
So, if I, derive the output of the system,
as the system
T, let me call the system T operating on
the input signal x n1, n2,
and then I'll replace the signal by its
inverse Fourier transform.
So this is equal to this double integral
of X
omega 1 omega 2 e to the J omega 1 n 1 and
to the the J omega 2 n 2 d omega 1 d omega
2.
Actually,
the inverse Fourier transform tells me
that You
can think of any signal x, n1, n2 as
the weighted sum of this complex
exponentials where the
weights are indeed the values of the
Fourier transform.
Now since the system is, is linear, and
assuming all the signals here are
well-defined, I can Interchange the order
of integration and, the operation
of the system, and the system operates on
signals that are functions of N1 and
2, therefore they're fully transferred the
weight as I called them.
constant, as constants as far as the
system is concerned.
So, I am left with this expression.
Now, we have started The,
expression, this expression we know that
this
complex exponentials are Eigen functions
of lsi systems.
So they go through the systems unchanged
and they're multiplied
by the frequency response of the system,
So therefore, this expression.
Becomes equal to this one, so if the
frequency response of the system times the
complex exponentials.
[SOUND]
So now this is the expression for the
inverse for the transfer of y, and
therefore
this signal here is the fully transfer of
y, so this is y omega 1, omega 2.
So, indeed, we showed that y omega 1,
omega 2
equals x, omega 1, omega 2 times the
frequencies.
And so this is.
[SOUND]
We are rooted to this operation when we
talk about the example.
So therefore all this tells me that
looking at the frequency response of the
system, I have to just process each
frequency one at a time, right?
So if H here is 0 at certain frequencies
then the output Y is going to be 0.
Therefore those frequencies of the input
signal would not go through the system.
