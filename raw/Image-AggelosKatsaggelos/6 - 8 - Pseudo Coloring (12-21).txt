Hello and welcome back.
Pseudo-Coloring and colorization of a gray
scale image are covered in this segment.
The two topics closely related since with
both a
black and white image is turned into a
color image.
The objectives however of the two problems
differ.
A number of objectives drive
Pseudo-Colorings, such
as to place normal objects in strange
colors for attention, color a normal scene
to match the color sensitivity of a
human viewer, exploit contrastivity,
produce a natural
color representation of a set of
multi-spectral
images of a scene, and enhance the visual
quality of the image in general, and
reveal details and structure in it that
were not visible before.
Colorization of black and white image, on
the other hand, has as its objective.
In most cases the recovery of color that
existed in
the scene but was simply not captured by
the sensor.
It is a technique that was made popular in
colorizing old
black and white movies, which were filmed
when color was not available.
We will discuss some basic information
of both Pseudo-Coloring and colorization
approaches.
We will describe a specific colorization
example, that of colorizing a black and
white photograph of a famous painting by
Matisse, revealing
valuable information about the process the
famous master was applying in his work.
Let us then proceed with this exciting
topic.
Some of the motivations, along with some
examples of turning a
gray scale image into a color image image
are discussed next.
Pseudo-Coloring or false coloring is an
enhancement
technique of assigning colors to gray
scale values.
It is done primarily for human
visualization and interpretation of gray
scale events.
More specifically some of the reasons are,
we might want to place objects in
strange colors for attention since humans
will
notice odd colored objects more than
others.
We want to take advantage of the color
sensitivity of the human viewer.
The luminous response of roads and cones
the retina picks in the
green region of the visible spectrum and
we want to account for that.
We want to exploit the contrasts
sensitivity of
the eye to changes in the view light.
So we map normal colors of objects with
fine details into shadows of blue.
And we want to produce natural color
presentation of multi-spectral images of a
scene.
And some of these images may not even be,
obtained by sensors whose response is
within the visible wavelength range, such
as infrared and ultra-violet.
I've also included here the colorization
of black and white images and videos.
Although, there, in many cases the
objective
is to reproduce the true colors that
were there in existence, although, all we
have available is a black and white image.
By and large the colorization of black
image and videos depends on initial
selection of colors and therefore it's
looked upon as an enhancement technique.
So color is important because also humans
by and large can discern thousands color
shades and intensities, compared to only a
few dozen or so of shades of gray.
We show here the seven bands of a LANDSAT
multi-spectral image.
This image actually was shown earlier in
the introduction of the course.
So this is the blue, green, and red bands,
and the other four are infrared bands.
This is actually the LANDSAT image of the
city of Amsterdam.
Instead of looking at the bands one at a
time as shown here as a, as a grayscale
fashion, we can combine the bands and
produce color images such as this one.
These are actually from a different area.
These are from the city of London.
So combining the three visible bands, one
obtains an image like this.
The colors are kind of natural looking.
The city shows here in gray.
The water is blue and vegetation is in
green.
Combining the, 4-3-2 bands, 1- 2-3 are the
visible ones.
So there are two visible here and one
infrared.
One is able to better see the vegetation,
if red is reflected differently.
And here's a combination of two infrared
and one visible band.
And in this case, this is suitable for
geological, agricultural, purposes.
>> We see here a beautiful Pseudo-Color
image of the Great Lakes area,
taken by this MODIS, which stands for
Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer, aboard the NASA
satellite, Aqua satellite.
So this is Lake Michigan.
And Chicago is around here.
Lake Superior is up here.
Huron, this one and so on.
So, for this first color image, a
combination of a shortwave
infrared, a near infrared, and the red
channel were used.
And with this Pseudo-Coloring we're able
to
distinguish ice from snow and water from
clouds.
We see Lake Superior up here is completely
frozen,
and this was taken in the recent winter of
2014.
We describe here some of our own work on
colorization.
This additional picture of the masterpiece
by Matisse, Bathers by
a River which is owned by the Art
Institute of Chicago.
This is an impressive painting, which
measures almost four by 2.6 meters.
It is considered to be one of the five
most beautiful works of his career.
He worked on it, on and off for almost
nine years.
The exact periods are shown here.
Sometime around the beginning of November
1913, Matisse arranged for the
photographer and dealer by the name of
Druet to record the state of the painting.
So the black and white photograph he took,
is shown here.
The artist kept working on the painting
after
the photograph was taken for another four
years.
So, the photograph is very different from
the current state of the painting.
So the problem at hand is to reproduce the
color information of the painting
back in November of 1913, as if Druet was
using a color camera.
Or in other words, we want to colorize the
grayscale image.
Colorization techniques have been utilized
for movies since the 1970s.
However, the requirements for painting
colorization are
different, since high accuracy and
fidelity are needed.
And the image formation model differs
significantly from the natural
or cartoon type of images that we use
primarily for colorization.
In our colorization algorithm, some
initial conditions are needed.
Pixels for which the color is known, and
then this color
is propagated through the rest of the
pixels in the image.
These initial conditions are typically
referred to as scribbles.
In finding this [UNKNOWN] conditions for
the problem
at hand, we found the correlation between
the
intensity values of the direct picture and
the
intensity values of the painting in its
current state.
We show the maximum of these correlation
values.
So, for this location shown here, where
the
correlation is, is large, we can borrow
the
color from the current state of the
painting
to utilize, to colorize the, the drab
picture.
In addition, microscopic holes were
drilled into the painting.
And here we see a cross-section of the
painting at 200 times magnification.
So it's, since, since Matisse was adding
or scraping away, painting while, just
working on
this painting for nine years, it's not
straightforward
to identify which layer corresponds to
which year.
However, the curators were able to say,
for example in this case, this gray layer
here belongs to the 1913, November, 1913
period
that, the picture, the great photograph
was taken.
So this additional information from this
investigation, this forensics here, was
utilized as well to generate scribbles,
and at the end these are the scribbles
we are going to use, we used in colorizing
the Druet photograph.
So the basic principles of the algorithm
we
used to colorize the Druet photograph are
discussed here.
So, changes in color correspond to changes
in intensity and therefore based on
that, if two pixels have similar intensity
they will be assigned similar color.
We worked in the YUV color space.
We have the Y of course, the intensity of
the luminance.
And to solve for the two chrominance
components, U and V.
So in solving for U, for example, we have
the value of U at location r, as shown
here.
Then you consider the neighborhood, such
as the red window shown here.
And you're solving for the intensities in
these neighboring locations.
So we're trying to minimize this square
[UNKNOWN] term, but the, intensities
are weighted by this factor which is
dependent on the difference in intensity.
So if this pixel and this pixel have
similar intensities
then this weight is going to be close to
one.
If the intense is similar then, that is
going to be small.
So by doing so we form a system
of equations, linear equations, say x
equals b, and
solving that we just propagate the color
from the
known scribbles to the rest of the pixels
image.
So finally we see here the black and white
photograph again, the Druet photograph
taken November 1913, and
here are the results of colorization of
this photograph
based on the algorithm that I just briefly
described.
The colorized result is smooth.
He has limited color blending, and is
consistent with conservation and art
history research.
It reaffirms that he started color counts
of
how the painting appeared at that time
period.
This work helps support research that has
for the first time uncovered how Matisse
begun the work as a highly chromatic, more
naturalistic scene, but it changed
it to ex, to explore new artistic
directions on one hand, while
at the same time, reflecting the graver
national mood due to the first World War.
Furthermore, the colorized version helped
curators and art historians visualize
the process by which Matisse composed and
transferred this complex
work to reach its final form, and also
helped them
to identify other works by the artist
reflecting a similar process.
