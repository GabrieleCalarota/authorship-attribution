Welcome back.
Having introduced the two-dimensional
continuous fully
transform of a discrete two-dimenstional
signal in
the previous segment, we can now describe
and understand the operation of something.
That is, the operation of turning a
continuous signal into a discrete one.
As we've discussed during the first week
of
class, sampling is needed in being able to
bring a continuous signal into the
discrete world,
so that it is processed by a computer.
In most cases they're also interested in
bringing
the discrete signal back to the continuous
world.
So that we can see it, or so that we're
able to hear it.
The fundamental question, therefore, when
sampling is
performed, is under what conditions can we
move back and forth between the continuous
and discrete worlds, without loss of
information.
Or, under what conditions we can
reconstruct the continuous signal from its
samples.
We derive these conditions which are
referred to as the Nyquist Theorem.
A [UNKNOWN] signal can be reconstructed
from
its samples if it is sampled with
frequency
at least twice as large as the highest
frequency of the signal in each dimension.
We derive the theorem in two D.
However, it's straightforward extension of
the one D subject theorem.
And it can also be extended in similar way
to dimensions higher than two.
Actually, in two and higher dimensions,
there
is more freedom in preforming periodic
sampling.
We'll only cover here rectangular periodic
sampling, but one
could use, for example, hexagonal periodic
sampling in two D.
Sampling provides the intuition in
understanding what happens
when we sample now the continuous Fourier
domain.
It leads to the definition of the discrete
Fourier series.
And also the definition of the discrete
Fourier
transform, which is the topic of the next
segment.
So let us now have a closer look at this
exciting material.
One of the important concepts in digital
signal processing is the concept of
sampling.
It connects the analog to the discrete
world.
It's true that with the proliferation of
digital sensors, there is less
of a need for converting an analog image
to a digital one.
But, the mathematical concepts of
something that important,
for understanding other topics in imaging
and video processing.
They're important, for example, in
allowing us to understand the steps we
need to take in changing the sampling
grade in the digital domain.
For example, when we up sample or down
sample an image, as you'll see later.
So assume that we have an analog image
like the one shown
here, such an image can appear for example
on a positive photographic field.
I realize of course that for the younger
people in the class you may or may
not be familiar with negative or positive
fields,
it is however worthwhile continuing with
this topic.
Again I present the signal in the
frequency domain, and here is the
spectrum of the analog signal X sub' a'
Omega One, Omega Two.
What we show here is really the region of
support of this spectrum and not that
shape of this spectrum itself, but it's
not
relevant the shape for the discussion that
follows.
I want now to represent this image by
discrete sample so, I super-impose a
grid that's shown here, and only keep the
values of the image at the grid points.
So the digital image I end up with is the
one shown here.
And there are two parameters of control.
This grid, the spacing in this direction T
one.
And the spacing of the vertical direction,
T two.
And these are referred to as a sampling
periods.
I can now represent this descrete signal
in the frequency domain.
I can take the fully transfer of this
signal as we've done already
in this class, and if I find this
spectrum, it looks like this.
It's not surprising this periodic because
we do know the spectrum of a
discrete signal is periodic a property
that we covered in quite some detail.
And it is formed really by performing the
periodic extension of
the spectrum of the analog signal, again
as shown here.
The mathematical expression to describe
this, is the one shown here.
You are used to put, so far we've been
using this notation Omega One, little
Omega One, Omega Two.
Denote the Fourier Transform of a discreet
signal, and this is exactly called this is
since Omega One is the normalized
frequency
and equals big Omega 1 Times t 1.
So Omega One is in gradients, while bigger
omega one is in gradients per unit
distance.
Spatial distance, let's say, millimeters,
as an example.
And t 2 is also in millimeters, so the
units, the dimensions really match.
And of course, Omega Two is Given by
similar expression.
So what this expression tells me again is
that they take
the spectrum of the analog signal, and I
periodically extend it.
So k one ranges from minus infinity to
infinity.
So does k two.
And the periodic extension in the
horizontal direction
is with respect to two pie over t one.
One, the vertical direction with respect
to two pi divided by T2.
So this point here is two pi divided by
T1, while this point is two pi divided by
T2.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
So, we see that in performing something,
there
are two important parameters: the sampling
periods, T1, T2.
They control the spacing of the point in
the spatial domain, and they also control
how far
apart the replicas of the the analog
spectrum
in this periodic extension, are going to
be located.
We say that the analog image is critical
example,
if I use the appropriate T1, T2 here,
sampling periods.
So that when I find now the fully
transform
of a discrete signal, which is formed by
the periodic
extension of the spectrum of the analog
signal, the
spectra here just touch, next to each
other without overlapping.
And in this case, at least mathematically
speaking, I can filter the base
bond of the spectrum of the discrete
signal, and then this will give
me back the spectrum of the analog signal,
therefore, I will be able to go from the
discrete weld, but the continuous weld
without losing any information.
If I use a smaller t one, t two sampling
periods than in the previous case,
then when I look at the spectrum of
the discrete signal, is going to look like
this.
And, in this case I've used more sample
I needed to represent accurately the
continuous image.
I therefore, I have oversampled.
[SOUND]
If I go the other direction, and use
sampling periods here t1, t2,
which are greater than the periods used
for critical sampling Then if I
look at the spectrum of the discrete
image, it looks like this, while my new
periodic extension, one replica overlaps
with another replica, and this phenomenon
is referred to as aliasing.
Which means that the high frequencies here
alias
themselves as low frequencies the use of
false identity.
Under this case, it's not possible to
recover the original signal.
I am not able to untangle the low and high
frequencies that can be, mixed up.
In performing sampling, an important
question is what should
the samplings periods t1 and t2 be quelled
to.
So that, I'm able to go back from the
discrete samples to the analog image.
Intuitively, one should expect that how
close together the samples are
should be a function of the spatial
frequency in an image.
If the image intensity varies a lot and
rapidly, which
means that there's a lot of high-frequency
energy Then, intuitively,
one should use samples that are close
together, so that
all of these first variations of intensity
have captured the property.
If on the other hand, they have another
flat image, then a few
samples will suffice, and this is exactly
what the Nyquist theorem tells us.
So here is again the support of the
spectrum of the analog image,
and lets call Omega n1 the highest
frequency in the horizontal
direction and Omega n2 the highest
frequency in the vertical direction.
After I sample this image, the spectrum of
the
discrete image is desirable but it looks
like this.
So in other words, there is no aliasing.
So this point is two pi over t1 and
therefore the
point in here is two pi t1 minus Omega and
one.
So clearly, as long as the ordering of
these two points is as shown here.
So, as long as two pi over T1 minus omega
n1 is greater or equal than
omega and one, there's no aliasing in the
horizontal direction.
And this gives us the condition that the
something frequency should be
at least twice as high as the highest
frequency in the image.
And they can obtain the similar condition
in the vertical direction, so the
something frequency in the vertical
direction should
be greater equal then omega and two.
So if these two conditions are satisfied,
then I can recover the analog image
from the discrete one by using a low pass
filter, as shown here.
So, this low pass filter, let's say,
f omega 1 Omega 2 should be equal
to T 1 T 2 as long as Omega 1 is less than
pi over T 1 and Omega 2 less than pi over
T 2,
and 0 otherwise.
This T 1 T 2 gain is here because if you
look back, a few slides back, at the
relationship between the spectrum of the
discrete signal and
the analog signal, there's 1 over t1 t2
factor there.
So I need this gain to bring back the
signal It's original values.
So this frequency, this is for example,
minus pi over T1,
this is pi over T2, so this is the filter
that is shown exactly here.
So in summary what the Nyquist Theorem is
telling me is that if I
have an unlimited analog signal I can
sample it with frequencies that satisfies
these conditions.
And then I can recover the analog signal
from the
discrete one using a filter like this on
the frequency domain.
And what this means in the spatial domain
is
that I perform bundling with the
Interpolation with a
candle, which is the Fourier transform of
this ideal
low pass filter, and this is a
two-dimensional sync function.
A sine x over x function.
In illustrating the concept of sampling,
oversampling, undersampling Let us
consider a simple one dimensional signal,
the cosine depicted here.
It has frequency equal to 0.9
Hertz, or in Omega units, 2 pi f
1.85 radiums per second.
So, in a ten second interval shown here,
there are nine cycles of this particular
cosine.
If I take the one dimensional fully
transfer of the signal now.
I see that its spectrum looks like this,
it
consists of two impulses at 1.8 pi minus
1.8 pi.
And clearly, this tells me that there's
only one
frequency present in the signal, it's
therefore a pure tone.
Now the Nyquist frequency,
[BLANK_AUDIO]
For the signal, it's either 1.8 hertz
or 2 pi times 1.8 radians per second.
So, here, with the grid examples, we show
the
sample version of this cosine when we
grade the over-sample.
If you recall from the previous slide, the
Omega Nyquist, with a note like
this, was, 1.8, times two pi,
radius per second So, 3.6,
by Rads per second, so
instead of using the Nyquist, I use a 60
pi rads a second or the
sampling period is run a 30th of a second,
so therefore I get 30 samples per second.
There are ten seconds in this interval, so
there are 300 samples shown here.
So, if I look at the spectrum of the
signal, then as we know, we take
the spectrum of the other analog signal,
these
two impulses, and periodically extend it
with period 65.
So here one replica here at 60 pi and
other minus 60 pi and so on and so forth.
And in this case, I can go back and forth
between the continuous and discrete
worlds by just using a low bus filter
pulling out these two impulses.
And, in the time domain, I'm going to
get continuous cosine signal that I
started with.
I sample now my analog cosine I'm working
with with period one second or frequency
one halves.
Or, an Omega with 2 pi radians per second,
we call that the Nyquist, where
the signal Omega band is 3.6 pi radians
per second.So with this sampling period in
this interval of ten seconds,
I have 11 actual samples, since I also
sample at equals 0.
Let's see how this sample signal looks in
the frequency domain.
Here is the spectrum of the analog signal,
and I know that the sample signal is
a spectrum which is a periodic extension
of the spectrum with periods 2 pi.
So here's one, the first replica of the
spectrum,
a second replica, and so on and so forth.
So clearly, the sky frequency component in
the original
signal alias as itself, as a low frequency
component.
So, when I reconstruct this aliased signal
using the low pas signal shown here.
I end up reconstructing the signals shown
here on the left with frequency 0.1 Hertz
or 1 cycle in this 10 second interval, I'm
starting.
You can, look at this signal also, the one
that results from
the first sample signal, where I had over
sampled, I had 300 samples
there, in this interval, and if I down
sampled by a factor of
30, so, I throw away 30 samples, I keep
one, throw away 30.
And so on, then, this is the signal that,
we'll end up.
So we can either think of this signal here
as resulting from the down-sampling
of the original analog sample or
down-sampling the
sample, the digital sample, right, so with
the down-sampling in the discrete domain.
We would like now to pictorially connect
what we've
learned so far and what, is going to
follow.
I will not be showing any equations.
Since they can be found in any
book on image processing of
multidimensional signal processing.
I think it's important to see what the
situation is behind the various concepts
underlining the
special frequency domains, and just focus
on the
elements that are of primary importance in
image processing.
So we started with analog image, such like
the one shown here.
Which we represented also in the frequency
domain.
So, here see the continuous spectrum of
the continuous image in the Omega one and
Omega two, axis and of course we show
here, just the unit's apart of the
spectrum.
So then we sample this image.
[UNKNOWN] disagreed and we kept the values
at the grid points.
And we also can represent as we know
by now, this discrete image in the
frequency domain.
We know by now that the fully transfer of
the discrete signal is periodic
And is formed by the periodic extension of
the spectrum of the analog image.
I can present the spectrum in the bigger
Omega One, Omega Two
domains, the continuous frequencies, or
the
normalized frequencies, little Omega One,
Omega Two.
In going back and forth between the
continuous and discrete worlds,
I need to know the sampling periods, or
the sampling frequencies.
If however, all we are given is a discrete
image, or a two-dimensional
array of numbers, we don't know what
is the spatial distance between these
numbers.
Between the big cells, and therefore, I
can only express the spatial
frequency content in terms of the
normalized continued frequency in the
domain.
And this is material we have covered so
far in the previous slides.
Now an interesting question that arises is
what will happen in the
special domain if I sample the Fournier
transfer of the split image.
We saw before that sampling in the spatial
domain results
in periodic extension of the spectrum in
the figurative domain.
So our intuition tells us that the similar
operation should take place
now in the special domain now that there's
something in the frequency domain.
In other words the image should be
periodically extended.
And this is exactly what happens as we can
show mathematically.
So we can see the periodic discrete
spectrum
corresponds to a periodic discreet two
dimensional signal.
Of course, the density of sampling in the
frequency domain will
determine the period in the periodic
extension in the special domain.
If I under sample in the frequency domain,
aliasing will take place in the spatial
domain.
So we see that a discreet periodic signal
has a discreet periodic representation in
the frequency domain.
And this is, indeed the Fourier Series.
Going from here to here is the Fourier
Series representation.
The discrete spectrum is often referred to
as a line spectrum.
Now one period in the frequency domain
corresponds to one period in the spatial
domain.
And in Showing this here, I have chosen
the
sampling in the frequency domain to be
done critically,
so I have the same number of samples in
one period in both the spatial and
frequency domains.
So, we see here that, and then one, let's
say, by m 2,
period image corresponds when one and two
samples in
the frequency domain, and this mapping
here is that
discrete fullier transfer mapping that we
will study next in quite some detail.
So we see that if I have an N1 by N2
image,
I can represent it uniquely by an N1 by N2
samples of the frequency domain of the
spectrum of this image.
So it's important to keep in mind that
behind the
DFT, there are discrete periodic
two-dimensional signals in both the
spatial
and frequency domain Since the number of
the properties of the
D.F.T. can be derived and understood, by
considering these, periodic extensions.
