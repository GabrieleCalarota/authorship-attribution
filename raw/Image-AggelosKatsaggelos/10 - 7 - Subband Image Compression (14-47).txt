We can represent any signal, such as
images, in the frequency domain.
Then, we can perceive the segments in this
frequency domain, the so-called
sub-bands, and examine the behavior of the
signal in each of these sub-bands.
The characteristics of an image differ in
each sub-band.
Some are low-frequency sub-band, bands,
some are high-frequency in one dimension.
And low in the other, and so on.
Then, the main idea in sub encoding is
that
we can now adapt the compression scheme to
each sub-band.
This means that different parameters can
be utilized for the same encoder,
or that a completely different decoder can
be used in each sub-band.
Therefore, there are a large number of
possibilities.
One of the issues, of course, is to design
appropriate
filters that would allow us to perform
this sub-band decomposition.
Filters that would allow perfect
reconstruction of the signal.
We discuss and analyze all these concepts
in this segment.
So let's have a specific look.
The idea of sub-band coding is quite
interesting and intriguing.
So we first use a bank of filters to
divide the image into sub-bands.
And each sub-band contains a set of
spatial frequencies.
So each sub-band has reduced bandwidth,
with respect to the original image.
If the sub-bands are of equal size
then we're talking about equal rate
sub-band decomposition.
If, on the other hand, they have different
bandwidths then we're referring to as
multirate decomposition.
The main idea from this decomposition is
now,
we can exploit the properties of each
band.
And use a different compression scheme to
compress the various bands.
So different bitrates or different coding
techniques can be
used for each sub-band, by taking
advantage of the properties
of each sub-band, and also by allowing for
errors
to be distributed across sub-bands in a
visually optimal manner.
So this is a celebrated approach that has
found applications
both in still image compression as well in
video compression.
As well as in speech and audio
compression.
Some of the most successful audio
compression standards are based on
sub-band decomposition.
So the principle of sub-band decomposition
is demonstrated here.
We show it for a one dimensional signal,
but also
show it to the signal in a few slides
later.
So, we have the analysis filter bank and
the synthesis filter bank.
So, we see that the original sig, signal
is input here.
Then, we use a band pass filter 0 to band
pass filter M minus 1.
After filtering, the signal is decimated,
down-sampled by a factor of capital M.
We assume again we have M such sub-bands.
And after this decimation, we'll call
these
sub-bands separately, using a different
encoder per sub-band.
The compressed signal is either
transmitted or stored
to important applications in image and
video compression.
At the other end, the decoder.
We have the synthesis bank of filters.
So each sub-band is decoded separately.
Then, it's up-sampled by a factor of M.
And then it's band pass filtered and all
the sub-bands
are added to give an estimate of the
original signal.
These are operations that should make
perfect sense to you
at this point, because we covered them
earlier in class.
We saw what happens if we, we down-sample
is the spectra overlap.
We have the problem of aliasing.
That's why we first low pass filter or
band pass filter before we down-sample to
avoid aliasing.
On the other hand, when we up-sample, we
introduce M zeros in between the samples.
And then we use a band pass filter to
extract one replica of the spectrum.
Because what happens, in the frequency
domain, I have
replicas of the spectrum, through this
introduction of zeroes.
And through this band pass filtering, I
pull out one
replica, and I pull the signal in the
original resolution.
Here is the block diagram of a two-channel
sub-band decomposition.
And having this actually a two-channel I
can then cascade it and end up with
multi-band as well as multi-dimensional
signal sub-band decomposition.
So, we see the H1, H0 filters here.
The H0 is a low pass filter, H1 is a high
pass filter.
So, the summation by a factor of two,
encoding, up-sampling by a
factor of two, and here are the
up-sampling filters, F1, F0.
Conceptually, the up-sampling filters are,
are, are undoing
what the down-sampling filter did, you
might say.
And there is a lot of work on how to
design these filters H0, H1, F0, F1,
so that in the absence of compression, I
have perfect reconstruction.
We don't have per, perfect filters, if we
implement the spatial domain
they have a pass band, a transition band
and a stop band.
And there, for example the quadrature
mirror filters that give you
perfect reconstruction is a topic that has
seen a lot of activity.
In signal processing and there are quite a
lot of results that one can utilize.
So this is what is done in practice when,
with two
band decomposition system I want to build
a multiple sub-band decomposition system.
So, I start again, I show this
one-dimensional signal, you
break it into the low-frequency band and
the high-frequency band.
So X, X of omega.
If it's shifted by pi it gives me, if the
first
one's a low pass filter it results in a
high pass filter.
So downsampling takes place here, and now
I will take the low band or the
low frequency band and split it also
in its low frequency and high frequency
component.
I can take this low frequency band, and
fur, further split it into two.
I can take this high-frequency and further
split it into two.
So, in this particular example, I end up
with two, four, six, eight
different sub-bands, and they have the
name of, of this [UNKNOWN] essence.
So this is the LLL band, it, only low pass
filters were applied to this one to, to
obtain this band.
While this one, if the first filter's low
pass the
second is low pass but the third one is
high pass.
So pretty much we have all eight
combinations of these different letters.
And the last one is HHH.
So the, the, the filter was filtered three
times
by how, high pass filter to give us this
band.
And this band is here, the highest
frequency band.
The first band is down here, the lowest
frequency, and so on and so forth.
So, again, having one good pair of
decomposition, I can cascade it
this way, and I end up in an equal rate as
shown here.
Obtain as many bands as I want in this
multiband decomposition system.
And since this pair has also its
reconstruction,
perfect reconstruction pair, I can also go
from
this eight band decomposition here, for
example, to
perfect reconstruction using the pairs
that I started with.
Here's the picture of sub-band
decomposition in two dimensions.
If I have a filter that can break the
frequency spectrum
of a signal into four bands, so it's a
four band split decomposition, here.
Then, I can use that in a cascade to
obtain as many bands as needed.
So, in this particular example here, you
have a four band split.
And this is the four band split.
This is the LL, band and then LH is, is
here, right?
Because it's centered at zero you can do
the
periodic extension and see how these bands
look like.
And then we have the HL band and the HH
band.
So in the first pass I split the image
into four bands.
And then, for example, I can take the low
frequency band and split it into four
additional bands.
So that's how the picture's going to look
in the frequency domain.
Here are the four original bands and then
the
low frequency band was split into four
additional ones.
So this is actually an example of
multirate sub-band decomposition.
Because the bands are not all of the same
size or of the same rate.
And in practice, that's how we obtain
sub-bands,
either equal rate or multirate, just using
one pair.
Either two filters for a one-dimensional
signal or four
filters are shown here for the two
dimensional signal.
Here's one example of the use of sub-band
decomposition.
All these examples again were used
generated using DC Demo.
The original image is shown here, again.
And this is a four band decomposition
using 16-tap filters, so the
number of taps is the number of samples in
the impulse's [UNKNOWN] filter.
So you see here the four sub-bands, the
low, low
sub-band is just a decimated version of
the original image.
It was just low pass filter.
This is the, these are the low H and HL
bands, so
they show the high frequencies in the
horizontal and the vertical direction.
And this is the HH band, which shows the
high frequencies in both directions.
By and large you see some structure of
course in the low frequency band, and
then.
In the LH and HL bands and the HH band, by
and large, looks like white noise, doesn't
have much structure in it.
So for these four bands, for the first one
the LL DPCM was used to encode the
coefficients.
And we talked about DPCM, it's clear what
we are doing here.
It's differential pass code modulation, so
a prediction model was built to
predict and then correct the intensity
values of the low, low band.
Now for the other bands, the combination
of high
and low frequency and high, high band, PCM
was used.
So, no transformation was done, but just
reduced the number of bits representing
the samples.
And the rate was 1.6 bits per pixel.
So here is the resulting encoded image.
The PSNR is 36.5 dB, so it's definitely of
high quality.
As I mentioned, anything above 30 dB
represents a very close
representation of the constructed image,
very close to the original one.
Here's a second example of the application
of multirate, now, sub-band decomposition.
The original image.
So it's split first into four sub-bands.
And then for the low sub-band we further
subdivide it into four sub-bands.
So it's certainly multirate, it's a seven
band decomposition, and also
17, I'm sorry 16 tap filters were used for
this decomposition.
Then here are the quantized sub-bands, the
first
sub-band, the low, low DPCM was used for
that.
And for the rest, PCM at 155 bits per
pixel.
And we see here the encoded one is of
similar quality, slightly
higher, higher quality than the previous
one for a very similar bit rate.
But certainly there is more computation
that is
involved when you go to more than four
sub-bands.
Here we have again seven sub-band
decomposition.
So we have reached the end of week nine.
Three more weeks to go.
75% of the course is over.
Congratulations to all of you.
You should really feel proud about your
accomplishment.
During this week, the second week out of
three
dedicated to compression, we talked about
lossy image compression.
This is a very important topic, since we
are
surrounded by a plethora of applications
depending on image compression.
We discussed and analyzed the fundamental
topics, and covered
some of the intellectually interesting and
practically useful techniques.
We talked about the important concept of
quantization, both scalar and vector, and
covered
DPCM, fractal encoding, transform encoding
and JPG
and finally we briefly covered sub-band
encoding.
Prediction and transformation of the data
are two very
fundamental and important topics
encountered everywhere in signal
processing.
We presented an encoder in terms of three
important building blocks, and tried to
point out the differences and similarities
of all techniques we described.
There was nothing terribly mathematical in
the material of this week, except maybe
for the material on fractal encoding and
the derivation of the optimal quantizer.
So, I hope everybody feels comfortable
with this material.
The material, I believe, allows you to
understand the
image compression technology around you,
use it, and also
be able to potentially take the next step
in
pushing the envelope, and developing the
next image compression technique.
Next week, we'll talk about the system
problem
of im-, image compression, that of video
compression.
So, see you all next week.
