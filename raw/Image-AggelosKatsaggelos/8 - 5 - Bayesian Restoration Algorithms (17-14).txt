Welcome back.
With some of the more recent image
restoration approaches.
We are interested in obtaining an estimate
of the
posterior, not just its maximum value, as
with map estimation.
Coupled with a hierarchical paradigm,
prior models for unknown signals
are defined, that is for the noise, the
original image.
But also for the points function of
the blurring system for the blind
restoration case.
And also models are defined for the
parameters which define such priors.
Then the posterior for all unknown
parameters is four.
Since its estimation is not directly
feasible
an approximation of it is sought after.
With such an approach, the original image
and poise function of the blur are
estimated
along with the unknown parameters, such as
the
noise variants, automatically based on the
available data.
Since, it becomes a rather complicated
estimation problem.
We do not show any of the algorithmic
details.
Instead, we show some experimental
results, which represent
one of the state of the art results.
So, let us now proceed with the material
for this segment.
I would like to make a few comments based
on what we have seen.
In the previous few slides, we saw that
the result of the maximum like Wood and
MAP estimation, resulted in some nice,
closed form solutions.
This clearly may not be the case, and
simply depends
on the noise model in the image prior we
use.
So, depending on these choices we may have
to address some challenging
optimization problems which are outside
the scope of what we are doing here.
The second comment is that in all these
derivations, we assume that the image and
noise covariances.
In the general case or the specific
parameters
alpha and beta, where assumed to be known.
So, the, our techniques to try to estimate
such parameters offline but in general.
We need to address the estimation of this
parameters, as well.
Also, we have been dealing with the
non-blind restoration
problem, according to which the blurring
function H.
The impulsive part of the system, the
matrix HR known ahead of time.
But clearly, very often this may not be
the case and
therefore, one needs to address the blind
restoration problem as well.
This is a topic that has seen quite some
activity, and there are techniques that.
First, estimate the blur and then perform
the restoration
problem, so it's a separate and sequential
estimation process.
However, the last two points can also
be addressed through the hierarchical
Bayesian paradigm.
I would like just to give you a flavor of
this paradigm, just mention it, describe
it at a very high level simply because we
end up with challenging optimization.
Approaches in many cases, and this is
something, again, outside the scope of
this course.
However having this basic information, I
believe that you'll
be able, for those of you interested, to
look into
the literature and, and dive a bit deeper
in mm,
looking at some of these very interesting
and exciting results.
What we discuss here is an extension of
the material we already covered.
So we're interested in forming this joint
distribution shown here.
And the distribution of f the unknown
original image we tried to estimate h,
the unknown impulse response of the
degradation
system, so we are addressing blind
restoration here.
This set omega which incorporates all
the unknown parameters, model parameters
we introduced.
So omega refers to as the hyper
parameters.
And y is the observed noise in blurred
image.
Now the hyperparamaters are treated
themselves as random variables,
therefore we bring in information about
them through the probability of omega.
This is a hyperprior.
So according to the product rule of
probability we have a disjoint
equals the likelihood,
function times the
prior knowledge we bring to the problem,
and the prior consists of a prior on the
original image f, a prior on
the unknown.
Impulse response of the degradation system
h and the prior, on the hyper parameters.
So, if we look at a, for example, at quad
hyperprior we saw that for the likelihood
there was the parameter beta as, as an
unknown
that a minus 1 is the noise variance
actually.
That image prior involved the parameter
alpha and
let assume that we have a prior on h.
Lets move this prior, for example, that
involves another parameter gamma.
Then the set of hyper parameter omega is
simply these
three parameters, alpha, beta, gamma that
also I need to estimate.
So, we try to draw inference again based
on the posterior.
The probability of the unknown parameters,
again, the original image,
the impulse degredation system and the
hyper parameters given the observed image.
According to base rule, is equal to this
fraction.
And depending on the approach we follow,
we
can draw inference again from this
posterior function.
So, we have introduced two additional
parameters, h and omega but other
than that the framework is again an
extension of what we already covered.
It's called the hierarchical paradigm,
Bayesian paradigm, because in the first
stage we model the noise, the original
image and
the, the gradation system, and in the
second stage we model the.
Hyper parameters through these hyper
priors.
The different ways for draw inference from
the posterior, we showed in the previous
slide.
One of which is again maximum likelihood.
We try to maximize the likelihood function
here, with respect to the three unknowns.
It's the original image.
The impulse is possible the system and the
set of the hyper parameters.
Clearly now, there are three unknowns
involved
and their optimization problem is more
challenging.
One general approach is to alternate
optimization, so you fix two parameters,
you fix each of the mega for example,
optimized with respect to f.
The result of the optimization is fixed on
f then let's say, h
is also fixed and to iterate on omega and
keep iterating this way.
Similarly, a map estimate can be obtained
by maximizing the posterior.
It's shown here again, this is the
numerator
of the posterior, the denominators
independent of the optimization.
This is now, even more challenging than
maximum likelihood.
Again, three unknowns alternating
optimization is again
a general approach that one can follow.
Both these approaches provide so called
point estimate.
Just one answer for the unknown parameter.
One might be interested in obtaining an
estimate of the posterior itself.
In that case, one can follow a
variation or approximation approach to the
posterior.
So as the name implies.
A function that is better behaving is used
to approximate the posterior and then this
other function is optimized and provides
the desired form of the, the posterior.
This is advantageous because now one can
obtain additional information about the
estimation process and possibly the
different points to represent
the restored image as well as the unknown
impulses points.
Alternatively one could sample the
posterior through some modicarlo
approaches, and that way an estimate of
the posterior can also be obtained.
In all of these cases, however, the
resulting
optimization is outside the scope of this
course.
But again, for those of you interested, I
believe
we have some basic understanding here, of
this material.
And you should be able to quote the
literature and look deeper into any of
these approaches.
As
mentioned multiple times so far the amount
and
quality of the prior information about the
image, the
blur, and the noise is of the utmost
importance in establishing the quality of
the restored image.
When it comes to Bayesian methods, this
prior knowledge is
incorporated into the algorithm through
the use of prior models.
We discussed such prior models for the
noise and the image in previous slides.
Another image prior model is a total
variation model shown here.
It has become very popular recently in
the restoration literature because of it's
edge
preserving property, by not over
penalizing this
continuity in the image while imposing
smoothness.
Z of alpha here is the so-called partition
function.
Delta of i, h is the horizontal gradient
of the i'th pixel,
while delta i, v is the vertical gradient
at the i'th pixel.
This actually represents a quadratic
approximation to the TV prior.
And alpha is the hyper parameter that
needs to be estimated.
When it comes to modelling the blur, one
of the models
that has been used is also a SAR of the
blur.
As we discussed, such a model imposes
smoothness on h in this particular case.
It's a reasonable model for a good number
of the blurs that we encounter in
practice, like the ones I showed at the
beginning of the restoration segment of
the course.
So, here the hyper parameter is denoted by
gamma and it needs to be
modelled and estimated through this
[UNKNOWN] framework.
The literature is rich with prior models
for both the images and the blur.
It maybe goes without saying that the
more complicated mathematically speaking
the model, the,
hopefully better the result, but also
harder
the optimization problem, one has to
solve.
In the following, I will show some
experimental results, when these two
priors are used.
The tv for the image and the SAR for the
blur.
I will not show any of the mathematical
details.
This variation or approximation.
Approach that they mentioned the previous
slide is utilized.
But again the main point is just to give
you a flavor of what is achievable.
I will show here in a synthetic experiment
results blind and non blind restoration
results utilizing the variation of
Bayesian algorithm
that I just mentioned a few slides
earlier.
The results are fully automated in the
sense that all the parameters that are
needed.
Such as the noise variants and the image
and
blur model parameters, are estimated
automatically from the data.
So, we show here the degraded.
The blur has Gaussian shape and variance
nine, and
the blurred signal to noise ratio is 40
dB.
This is the result of blind restoration,
when SAR
models are used, both for the image and
the blur.
When now, a TV model is used for the
image, while
the same SAR for the blur, this is result
we obtain.
And if we perform a different
implementation of the
TV image model, we obtain the image shown
here.
By comparing the blind restorations here.
Most people, one would agree that the TV
provides better restorations.
The TV image prior.
And this is also reflected by
the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio
number.
Now, if the blur is known, and this is a
synthetic
experiment so we know exactly the blur so
it's a non-blind restoration.
Then these are the corresponding results
we obtain
within this three combination of models I
showed here.
Let me switch back and forth a few times
to see.
What is the additional improvement one
obtains by knowing exactly the blur?
So, a similar comment can be made here
that the TV image prior provides.
Better results than the SAR image prior
visually and also by comparing the ISNR
numbers.
Actually you see here the piecewise smooth
result when you look at the
TV results that is the, is what the TV
model really promotes.
We show here in red, the original point
script function of the [UNKNOWN] system.
I draw over it, so that it's visible
and then below, you see three different
estimates of,
of the blur when the, the blind desolation
algorithm
is run and the difference SAR in
parameters that.
One has to choose in determining the hyper
priors, the priors
to impose on the hyper parameters that we
need to estimate.
So, by and large, all these three
estimates shown here, do
a reasonable job in approximating the real
or original estimated function.
We finally show a state of the odd blind
restoration result
utilizing the variational beta framework I
just mentioned a few slides earlier.
A sparse image prior is used, a so called
super Gaussian prior.
Since we are modeling the edges of the
im.age which is sparse.
We will be actually talking about sparsity
during the last week of the course.
So here is the acquired image and some
close ups.
This is an image I also showed at the
beginning of the lecture on restoration.
It's actually the building outside my
office at North Western University.
So, while the picture was taken, while the
aperture was
open, the camera moved or shook in an
unspecified way.
Applying this fully automated algorithm
that is all
the required parameters, were estimated
from the data.
Here is the restoration we obtained.
So quite a lot of information is revealed.
Looking also at the close up windows down
here.
We can see the people the people walking
there and a lot, a lot of detail.
The estimated blur is also shown here.
So, the shaking of the camera did not
follow a linear trajectory,
as was the case with the horizontal motion
blur we studied earlier.
