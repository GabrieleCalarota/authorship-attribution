Hello and welcome back.
In this segment, we compare the Wiener
filter, we obtained in
the previous segment with constrained lens
squares filter we derived last week.
We'll see that the mathematical
expressions differ only
in one term, the so called stabilizing
term.
So, if instead of measuring the image and
noise power spectra
from the available noise and blur image,
we model them instead.
So, we use a specific model for the power
spectrum
of the image as a function of the
stabilizing term
that was selected by the CLS filter, and
also we
use a specific model for the power
spectrum of the noise.
We assume it's white in [UNKNOWN].
Then the result of the two filters, of
the Wiener and the CLS filter become
identical.
We utilize the same simulated degraded
image we used extensively.
Last week to point out the similarities
and
differences between the Wiener and the CLS
filter.
So let us proceed with the coverage of
this material.
Here is the expression again of the
frequency response
of the non-causal Wiener restoration
filter we just derived.
I have divided numerator and denominator
by p of
ff and this is the form we end up with.
A common assumption is that the noise is
white, which means it's power
spectrum is flat and more specifically,
it's equal to the variance of the noise.
So in this case, this is the form of the
Wiener restoration filter.
Let us compare it now with another filter,
we derived a
bit earlier in the course, which is the
constrained least squares filter.
So, this is now the frequency response of
the CLS filter.
By comparing the two, it's crystal clear
they're very similar
and the differences, lets look at this for
between this term and this term.
It can be shown that the power
spectrum is real and more specifically
it's non-negative.
So, p of ff, omega 1, omega 2 is greater
than or equal to 0 for all omega 1, omega
2.
So, therefore, c but if alpha is equal to
the variance of the noise, of the white
noise and then the magnitude of this
filter here, this smoothness filter is 1
over the spectral
density of the image, then the two filters
become identical.
Clearly, when alpha is 0, and the noise
variance is 0, both filters reduce
to the least squares filter or generalized
inverse filter that we talked about.
So, one way to think about it, is that for
the CLS, I choose c and alpha is shown
here and then CLS gives me exactly the
same answer as would the Wiener filter.
Or going the other way around, you might
model the
auto correlation and therefore, the power
spectrum density of the
image in such a way that, at the end, this
equation down here, holds and you get then
a CLS filter.
Conceptually however, the, both filters
strive to achieve the same result.
And by that I mean if you recall, C omega
1, omega 2 is
a frequency response is a [UNKNOWN] here
of course of a high pass filter.
And the same is depicted by 1 over p of
ff, omega 1, omega 2.
The other correlation for most images has
this decaying exponential
shape that I discussed earlier and then
the [UNKNOWN] transform of that signal
is also a low pass type of signal in the
frequency of
domain, then 1 over this is a high pass
type of filter.
So again what we derived here is at the
high level
sum equivalence, you might say, between
the Wiener and the constrained least
squares specifically if the parameters
involved is chosen in a way
shown here and explained then they give us
exactly the same result.
But in general they try to achieve the,
the same objective which is
to regularized and make the, the high
frequencies of the inverse restoration
filter be tapered
off and not become very high because this
will introduce noise amplification.
Of course we saw that the mechanics, the
paths we followed to
obtain the Wiener and the constrained
least squares filters are distinctly
different.
Let us look at some experimental results
now.
We show here the power spectrum of the
cameraman image.
The 0, 0 value is quite high, and it's
outside the scale of the figure.
And it has this decaying nature that we
mentioned earlier.
And it's also non negative.
Here, we show the spectral density of the
noise is white noise.
Therefore, it's spectrum is flat.
This spectrum is not computed from the
image.
But, since it's a synthetic experiment, we
do know exactly what
the variance of the noise is, and that's
what we show here.
We show here, what is often called the
stabilizing term.
So this is the term of the denominator of
the filter, the Weiner of the
CLS that is added to the magnitude square
of the frequency responsible for the
degradation system.
So, well the Wiener filter is the term of
that power
spectrum of the noise divided by this
power spectrum of the image.
The noise in this example is white, so
this is equal
to the variance of the noiseso it's the
cost of the numerator.
It's a rather, maybe hard to see exactly,
the
shape of this filter here, but it's high
passing nature.
It's a constant divided by the spectrum of
the image, so that it has this decaying
shape.
So, one over this low pass will give me
high pass.
So indeed, they have high values at high
frequencies, here,
here and here, and it's, has small values
at low frequencies.
The zero, zero is in the center here, as I
indicated of this plot.
But, it's clearly not smooth, and that's
the
case indeed every time we work with real
data.
They don't behave as smoothly and as
nicely as synthetic data.
To compare this we show here the
stabilizing term for the CLS
filter is this term here and this is here
for a 2D application.
So it's a high pass filter of course and
it's rather smooth and nice
you might say but both of them in shape
are high pass filters.
And they're going to be added to the low
pass degradation filter, the
denominator of the Wiener filter over
there left, and the CLS on the right.
We're using this example the same
degradation system
we'll be using throughout this material on
image restoration.
So the degradation is due to horizontal
motion
between the camera and the scene over
eight pixels.
So what we show here is the magnitude
of the frequency response of the
degradation system.
It's a rectified sync and it's constant
along one of
the frequency axis as we showed this
multiple times earlier.
We see here the frequency response of the
Wiener restoration
filter for the parameters of the problem
we've been describing.
It's a bit hard to see the exact shape
again due to fact
that the power spectrum of the image is
based on, on actual data.
It is, however, the inverted sync
function, but
in the denominator of, added that
stabilizing term.
It's, here's small values here at 0, 0
frequencies, then it goes up
a little bit in the mid-frequencies and
then tapers off at high frequencies.
We compare this with the CLS filter
for this value of the regularlization
parameter.
So the structure is definitely more clear
since the
frequency response of the CLS filter is
considerably smoother.
To have a clearer view of the two
dimensional Wiener
restoration filter, we show here one slice
of its frequency response.
This lies at omega 2 equals 0.
Again, for the parameters, we computed the
paraspectrum of the image directly from
the original image which, of course, in a
realistic application is not available.
And also, since we added the noise, we
have exact
knowledge of its variance, and we utilize
the exact noise variance.
So we see here the inverted sync that is
tapered off at high frequencies due to the
stabilizing.
So the value is 1.
Here, it's 0, 0 and then you can see the
shape of the centers that are exact 0s of
these location and then it tapers off
nicely at high frequencies.
We compare these with the same slice of
the frequency response of the CLS
filter which was implemented in an
iterative fashion and here it shown after
330 iterations and this is a value of the
iterazation parameter that was
used this scale is the same, so, we have
the same high value here.
So the filter site identical here, and
their very very similar at, at low
frequencies.
However at higher frequencies, the CLS
filter has higher values.
Like here, I guess it's around five while
the same frequency's around two.
We also show the slides of the frequency
response of the CLS when it's implemented
directly.
The same, again, value of the Laplacian
parameter
in both cases that the Laplacian was used.
So now the scale here, the high value is
30, so I have this higher peaks here.
And also the values, similarly to the
previous comment, are higher at high
frequencies.
So again, this is five while it's two with
a Wiener filter.
So by and large, based on this qualitative
comparison, we expect, both these
and this filter to produce noisier
restorations than the Wiener filter.
But of course, with a constrained least
squares filter,
we have control over the regularization
parameter and increasing it
or decreasing, increase it we can change
the values
of the filter as high frequency, change
the, the shape.
So we show here on the left the noisy
blurred image is the same example we've
been using throughout
this segment of the course 1D motion blur
over eight
pixels and the blur signal to noise ration
is 20dB.
On the left you see the restored image
utilizing this non causal Wiener
restoration filter that we have analyzed
and
developed in this segment of the course.
And again, these are the spectra that were
utilized either
using the original image or from exact
knowledge of, of noise.
So this is in some sense, the upper bound
of the performance of the Weiner filter,
because we have exact knowledge in this
synthetic experiment of these parameters.
In practice, we have to find means to
provide good
estimates, obtain good estimates of p of f
and pww.
The improvement in signal-to-noise ratio
for this particular case is 3.93dB.
By and large is a, is a, is a rather good
restoration.
The noise is not terribly amplified snd
some
of the sharpness of the image has been
restored.
We show here again the result of the
Wiener restoration filter.
We're going to compare it with the
restored image obtained by the iterative
CLS filter.
This is the parameter of alpha and this
shown after 330 iterations.
We did show the frequency response of this
filter in earlier slides.
As was argued there, it's expected that
this restored
image by this filter was going to be
noisier
than the result of the Wiener restoration,
and this
is indeed the case by comparing the two
images.
Of course, noise simplification is traded
for sharpness in the image.
So, this image here is sharper than the
Wiener restoration.
We also compare it with a result of the
direct CLS restoration.
This now is even noisier than.
This is noisier than this and in both
cases, the ISMR is negative.
Of course, with the CSL filter, I
have different means to control it's
performance.
One is through the value of the
[UNKNOWN] parameter [UNKNOWN] through the
selection of c.
We'll be using the Laplacian here.
Three is through iterative implementation.
And in that case, we can use the number of
iterations as a means of regularization.
And four of course is the introduction of
adaptivity that we talked earlier.
The Wiener filter is a very celebrated
filter, it
has found many applications in addition to
image restoration.
And with respect to image restoration, for
a long time was somehow the
golden standard that everybody was
comparing
their results against the Wiener
restoration filter.
