Welcome back.
Very often we going to concentrate the
enhancement of an image at its edges.
We want to leave the rest of the
image unchanged, but only make the edges
look sharper.
A sharpened image typically conveys more
information, more details to the human
viewer.
Therefore, such class of enhancement
techniques
is referred to as sharpening techniques.
This is a topic of this segment in
which we'll describe a number of such
sharpening techniques.
We will start with unsharp masking or high
boost filtering.
The idea is very straight forward and has
its roots in analog photography.
A blurred version of the image is formed,
the abstract mask.
Which when subtracted from the original
image would
provide the high frequency information of
the image.
If this information, typically, amplified
is added
to the original image, a sharpened image
results.
Of course, any high pass filter can
extract such high frequency information
from an image.
An example of such a high pass filter is
the laplacian.
We'll talk about the laplacian with more
detail
in Week 11, when we talk about
segmentation.
We show, also, the results in
which, varying sharpening techniques are
combined.
So, let us proceed with this very visual
topic.
We'll discuss next the use of spatial
filters towards
sharpening an image, which results in an
enhanced image.
This technique has been used for many
years
by the printing and publishing industry to
sharpen images.
So given an original image here or
original signal, we blur
it, and this blurred version is the
unsharp
version of the signal.
Subtracting it from the original image
gives rise to the unsharp mask.
Then this unsharp mask is added to
the original image, resulting in the
sharpened signal.
As described in the previous slide, in the
block diagram of the previous slide.
If x is the original image, I blur it and
I find
what I denote here as the low frequency
part of the image.
I subtract it from the original and this
gives rise to the mask, the unsharp mask.
The the next step is to add the
unsharp mask it's multiplied here by
coefficient a.
So it's multiplied a added to the original
image and this is the sharp image.
If I write the original image as simply
the sum of the low frequency
part of it, plus the high frequency
component of the image.
Then the previous equation looks like
this.
So with unsharp masking, I keep the
low frequencies, but the high frequencies
are multiplied.
The booster multiplied by one plus a and
actually a is
greater that one this is failed to as high
boost filtering.
If a is less than one then the mask is
de-emphasized.
So if we put this to practice here is an
image of this quarter coins
and this is the sharpened version of this
image using this Unsharp masking method.
A equals 1 was used for this particular
example.
Here
is another example of the application of
unsharp masking to sharpen an image.
Here is the original image 216 by 308
pixels.
Here's a blend version of it by 7 by 7
Gaussian.
I subtract the blend version from the
original
one and obtain the unsharp mask shown
here.
The unsharp mask is added to the original
with alpha equals 1.
To give this sharpened image and with
alpha equals 2 to give this sharpened
image.
So clearly, the edges are sharpened or the
high frequencies in the image are boosted.
The main idea behind these sharpening
techniques is to
add to the original image, high frequency
information, edge information.
We saw that with unsharp masking we found
the unsharp mask, the
high frequencies, by taking the difference
between the original and the blurred
version.
Another way to obtain high frequency
information
is by finding the derivatives of the
image.
And specifically finding the second
derivative of an image,
which is referred to as the Laplacians of
the image.
We're not going to get into any details at
this point.
Since we'll start the gradients and
laplacians the first and
the second [INAUDIBLE] of an image when we
talk about segmentation.
So for the time being assuming that I can
find the high frequencies through the
second order of derivatives.
I can then add them to the originally
sharpened image that way.
So here's an example of the moon's north
pole.
And this image is actually a mosiac, it
was put together by 18 images taken
by Galileo's imagining system back in 92.
So if we look at this image, it looks
kind of blurry and, again, would like to
sharpen it.
So if we find the secondary version of
this image, the Laplacian, it looks like
this.
The Laplacian ranges from minus 255 to, to
plus
255, assuming the original image is a
eight-bit image.
And what we see here is the positive
value, since
the values below 0 were clipped, were set
to 0.
Another way to show the Laplacian is by
rescaling it, by scaling the minus 255
to 255 range, mapping it into 0 to 255 and
then this is what we see.
So clearly, the secondary contains the
edge formation of the image.
So, if I add the Laplacian to the original
image, then I obtain this image.
And if we compare this sharpened to the
original, it should be clear
that indeed the edges are enhanced the
high frequencies are boosted.
There are different ways as we'll see to
compute the
Laplacian, so if I compute it in a
different way.
By the way in this example the Laplacian
goes computed as shown here.
And more specifically this is more like a
two-dimensional impulses points minus four
in the middle and then one one here one
here and one here.
Here.
So this Laplacian, Laplacian was used to
compute this here and to compute this
image.
So if I compute the Laplacian a different
way.
And the different way is show here so the
impulse response
now is minus eight in the middle and then
one at all.
Of the locations in this three by three
mask, then I obtain this result.
Which by the way, is definitely sharper
than the
one we, I had with the first version of
Laplacian.
So this is the basic idea of sharpening.
Take the original image here.
At the high frequency information as
conveyed here by the Laplacian here.
And we have these beautiful results down
here where you can see, considerably more
detail.
When it comes to edges of this image of
the moon.
We see here a combination of some of the
sharpening and enhancement techniques that
we have covered so far.
So let's consider this whole body bone
scan shown here.
By looking at this it looks rather blurry.
So based on what we've learned, we can
find
that Laplacian, the second order delivered
of this image.
Then if we add the Laplacian to the
original image
we started with, we get the sharpened
image, as shown here.
We can also take the first order
derivative.
It's called Sobel gradient.
One of the ways to implement the first
order derivative, and
again, we'll cover these in more detail
when we talk about segmentation.
Now, I can take the Sobel, the first order
derivative we just saw and smooth it
out so it's averaged with a five by five
filter.
Then I take the product of the sharpened
image that I
had obtained by adding the Laplacian with
this smooth Sobel gradient.
So this gives me a mask, the, there
product.
And then I can add this mask to
the original image and the obtain this
sharpened image.
And finally, I can use a power law
transformation to further enhance the
appearance of this image.
So we do have values versions of
enhancement right?
This is an enhanced version of this and
this is a sharpened version
of the original and so is
this one a sharpened version of the
original.
So this also illustrate the fact that I
mention
multiple times that I want to talk about
image enhancement.
There is not just one specific objective
that will give us the optimal
way to enhance an image, but instead I
have a set of tools in my bag.
But I can utilize them appropriately and
they can try different tools.
And at the end, I can choose the one
process [UNKNOWN] that is most suitable
for my own purposes.
