We present in this segment a general
framework for solving estimation problems.
Like the recovery problems we're
addressing during this and next week.
The framework is rather intuitive and
quite powerful.
And it has been applied towards
the solution of various signal estimation
problems.
Of course, we apply it here specifically
to the image restoration problem.
According to it, we are interested in
estimating a
signal that belongs to a number of sets of
signals.
Each set represents the collection of
signals that possess a certain property.
For example, can define the set of all
smooth images or
the set of all images that only accept
non-negative intensity values.
Which is a very reasonable request given
the nature of light.
If the sets are convex, then the problem
we are asked to solve is simple.
One way to obtain a solution in later
section of the sets, assuming
it is not empty, is to alternate or
[UNKNOWN] projections onto these sets.
It's a rather intuitive and smart
framework, as we will see.
I would like to briefly discuss another
approach
towards solving recovery problems or
estimating a signal.
Under the name of Set Theoretic Approach.
And you'll see that, if we apply to
the specific problem at hand, the image
restoration problem.
We can come up with another version of the
constrained least squares filter.
This approach is rather intuitive.
According to it, we are looking for a
signal, an image, but has a set of
properties.
So, each property defines a set, such as
the one shown here.
So, all the signals, all the images that
belong to this set, have a specific
property.
The set of signals have the second
property we're
interested in define another set, such as
this one.
And there could be a third, a fourth
property and so on.
So for the problem at hand, the image
restoration problem, the example of
the first set is a set of signals that
satisfy this inequality here.
So this is the set of the images that have
high
frequencies, that have energy at the high
frequencies, less than absolute squared.
Says again, a high-pass filter and
therefore
this is the energy of high frequencies.
And this is the smoothness constrained, as
we explained earlier.
So all these signals that belong to this
set are smooth.
By the way, this set is shown as an
ellipse here in
the n dimensional space is an ellipsoid,
the generalization of an ellipse.
And is therefore a convex set, an
important property of such set.
The second set you can define based on our
restoration problem is, is shown here.
So, it's the set of images that have this
difference y minus Hf being
less than E squared and this is the
fidelity to the data constraint.
So, we are looking for an image that has
both of
these properties, it's smooth and
satisfies the fidelity to the data.
Therefore, we are looking for an image
that
belongs to the intersection of these two
convex sets.
And this intersection is going to be
convex as well since the sets are convex.
So this is the general setup of a set
theoretic approach.
And the question now is, how can one
obtain
a solution in the intersection of these
two sets.
By the way, these two sets, may have a
non-empty intersection, or may not.
So typically, after we find the solution,
we do a posterior test.
And we test if, indeed, the solution
satisfies both constraints.
Belongs to both sets, as we would be
interested in.
So, one approach to find the solution is
to
bound the intersection by another
ellipsoid, as shown here.
And choose the center of this ellipsoid,
of this bounding ellipsoid as the
solution.
We'll see that this approach can result in
a constrained least squares filter.
So I have again two sets, a set C 1 and C
2, each of them represents a set of images
with desirable properties.
They intersect, C 0 is the intersection of
the two sets.
And I'm interested in finding a solution
in the intersection of the two sets.
An intuitively, very clear approach is to
utilize projections onto convex sets,
Approach algorithm.
So according to it, I start from an
arbitrary initial condition
f 0 and I project image of 0 into the
first set.
So there's the projection P1 on set C 1 of
f 0.
Then I take this point and project it onto
the second set.
So this is now the projection two, one to
set two,
on the set C 2 of the point P1 of f 0.
And they call this f 1.
And I keep repeating this process.
I now take this point, project it to C1.
And then, I'll take it and project it back
to C 2 and so on.
So, the theory tells us that, in general,
if I have m, such convex sets.
If I repeat this projection onto
convex sets or alternating projection
algorithm, right.
I start with an f 0 arbitrary and project
onto the first, the second, the m set.
This gives me the new update, f of k minus
1 becomes f of k.
And they keep repeating this way.
Then, in the limit, after so many
iterations.
The solution of star here is going to be
in
the intersection, C 0, of this m, in
general, convex sets.
So this should be a very, again,
intuitively clear algorithm.
Of course, these projections, depending on
the description of these
sets, might be a rather straightforward
way to find these projections.
Or it might be terribly com, complicated.
So the theory of, set theoretic estimation
following
then any of the two solution approaches I
mentioned.
Has been applied to a number of problems
successfully.
And if I apply it now to the restoration
problem at hand, I will see what
expressions we obtain.
[SOUND]
So for the image restoration problem,
we're looking for
an image that belongs to both of these
sets.
This is the set that represents the
[UNKNOWN] to the data.
And this is the set that represents the
smoothness constraint.
So according to the first approach we
discussed, we'll
find a ellipsoid bounding the intersection
of these two sets.
And then it can be shown that the center
of
this ellipsoid, the bounding ellipsoid, is
given by this expression.
So this is the expression for the
constrained least squares filter that we
derived earlier.
The difference being that now the
equalization parameter alpha is given to
us.
Because we assumed that we know this two
bounds E and epsilon.
It should be clear that by picking E and
epsilon a certain way, these two sets may
not intersect.
If they both are, for example, chosen to
be very small.
And therefore, I need to check if indeed
this solution I
find, it belongs to both of these sets
that it should belong.
The second approach we discussed is the
projection onto convex sets.
So if I follow this, I have two sets.
The first one is set one.
So, this is C 1.
This is C 2.
And
this is the projection of f of an f of an
image onto the first set P 1 is given by
this expression.
And lambda here needs to be chosen
appropriately.
Soo that P1f belongs to set C 1.
Or another words, P1f satisfies this first
expression.
It is the projection of the second set,
the set of smooth images.
And similarly lambda 2 needs to be chosen
appropriately so that p2f belongs to the
second set.
So it keep alternating the projection so
to this two
set I'm going to converge to a point in
the intersection.
So again this is a specific application of
this set's theoretical approach to the
image restoration problem.
However now that hopefully you do, have a
grasp of the basic idea.
You can search and see that this approach,
estimation approach,
has been applied to the solution of
additional problems of interest.
