Hello, and welcome back.
It's hard to believe we are already done
with 1 3rd of the course.
One of your classmates suggested in the
forum that I
welcome you once or at least once I guess
in Greek.
So Carlos [FOREIGN].
This is going to be a fun week.
Image and video enhancement is a fun
topic.
One of the challenging parts of the course
is over
and you might say there will be smooth
sailing moving forward.
While some topics may be more mathematical
than
others Most of the topics we will follow
are application driven and probably not as
demanding
as the material of weeks two and three.
It has been a fun a topic because we learn
a set of tools, but we can utilize right
away.
And which will allow us to in a sense with
images and videos.
On top of that, we will be the judges
of how good and pleasing the enhanced
image is.
So, based on the tools we learned this
week, we can
carry out and try your favorite
enhancement technique on an image.
And if you are not happy with the result,
you can
change or kill the parameters which
control the performance of the technique.
Or just try another competing enhancement
technique
altogether until you are satisfied with
the results.
It's a fun topic because it's very
intuitive and rather
straightforward to understand, or at least
the better part of it.
Enhancement is certainly one of those
processes,
that it is used everywhere at all times.
You don't like how an image looks.
Well, let's enhance it.
Actually, all image processing software
packages includes a
good number of enhancement modules in
their repertoire.
So, during this week.
We'll introduce the topics of enhancement
and distinguish it from the
topic of restoration, which you will cover
during weeks six and seven.
We will then first cover point-wise
transformations of the intensity of an
image.
They're based on a general objective such
as dredging the contrast of an image.
Or by analyzing the image and more
specifically its histogram.
Imposing an objective on the histogram.
Such as equalizing it and then,
deriving the pointwise informations of
intensity values.
After that, we'll cover transformations of
the intensity value of the
image based on the properties of the
neighborhood of a pixel.
Performed both by an elasticized system
that we discussed in weeks two and three.
But also by an original filter.
We will then cover techniques which allow
the image to look sharper.
A specific technique for reducing the
dynamic range.
While at the same time increasing the
local contrast of an image through
homomorphic filtering.
The notion of adding color to a black and
white
image, and finally some simple notions of
enhancing a video sequence.
So, let us start this exciting week with
an introductory
segment where the distinction between
image enhancement and recovery is made.
We'll cover this week image enhancement,
but in
the following weeks we'll be covering
image recovery.
It is therefore worthwhile drawing the
distinction between these two related
topics.
With enhancement, the objective is to
manipulate or transfer an image
so that it's usefulness or visual
appearance is increased.
No explicit determination is made of how
this
increase in usefulness or visual
appearance will be measured.
With restoration or recovery, we are
modeling
the degradation the image is subjected to.
And our objective is to remove this
degradation.
And therefore recover some of the
information that was lost based on an
optimality criteria so there are two
important steps that are involved.
The modeling and the determination of an
optimality
criterion based on which the degradation
is removed.
Let us now look at some examples.
The first one is the modification of the
intensities
values of an image so that the contrast is
increased.
Since no modeling of the degradation is
involved, at least explicitly.
And no optimal criterion is determined,
based
on which the quantas will be increased.
This is definitely an enhancement
approach.
>> The second example is Deconvolution.
In this problem the degradation is modeled
as the convolution
of the original image with impulse
response of the degradation system.
So in other words the degradation system
is
linear and spatially invariant as we
learned earlier.
And the objective is to undo this effect
of the
degradation system or deconvolve the image
based on an optimal criteria.
So this is there for certainly restoration
problem.
The third example is Inpainting.
As you'll see, the degradation in, in the
this case, removes the
intensity values of the pixels in the part
of, of the image.
And the objective is to estimate these
missing values.
So, if this estimation is done without
determining and
optimality criterion, just doing an
operation that simply makes sense.
Then we have an enhancement problem.
If, on the other hand, the
impainting procedure depends on an
optimality criterion.
Then we have a recovery problem.
So, this would be either enhancement or
recovery.
[SOUND] In this class, we'll present, talk
about inpainting as a recovery problem.
And the final example is the smoothing or
removal of noise in an image.
This problem also can be either an
enhancement or a
restoration problem.
Depending on whether the noise
characteristics are modeled
and also whether a specific computing
criteria is defined.
We'll cover actually noise smoothing in
this class
both as an enhancement and as a
restoration problem.
It should be noted here that this
distinction between enhancement and
restoration is here to guide our
presentation of the various operations.
And also to guide our thought process when
we're trying an image processing problem.
Is not here to somehow erect solid walls
between these two topics.
And somehow penalize somebody, if
enhancement technique is
called a restoration technique or the
other way around.
Here is a summary of some of
the main characteristics of image
enhancement algorithms.
There are no theoretical guidelines in
approaching an enhancement problem.
Each enhancement problem and the criteria
for enhancement are typically subjective.
We want to increase the visual quality of
an image, for example, but each
viewer typically has a different quality
norm in their mind or in their eyes.
Each of us, most probably we have a
different
preference when we're presented with
process versions of an image.
And led us to find which one has the best
quality.
This criteria might even be to complex to
convert them to useful objective criteria.
Because of that, the enhancement
algorithms are qualitative and ad hoc.
They kind of make sense and in most cases
they work well, but they are also
application dependent.
A different transformation of the
intensities might be
performed if a user is to evaluate the
image.
Or if this image is input to an
object detection or an object tracking or
classification system.
Finally, coupled with the previous
comments, the evaluation of the
effectiveness of the enhancement algorithm
should also be application dependent.
Again, if the enhanced image is intended
for a human viewer, or for a classifier
the the criteria for evaluating its
effectiveness should be fair.
So enhancement techniques in general are
easy to understand.
And they've been very useful and very
widely used.
And the large number of them are actually
implemented in software packages.
So we will present a number of techniques
next.
And show examples of where after enhancing
the image is more pleasing to look at.
Or it provides additional information to a
classifier or an object recognizer or
writing system.
We'll also see examples where features or
objects in an image
that were not not visible before
enhancement are now visible after
enhancement.
So let us now look at some of these
enhancement approaches.
The image enhancement topics we'll be
covering
of this class are Point-wise Intensity
Transformations.
That are defined ahead of time to suit our
purposes towards enhancing an image.
Point-wise Intesity Transformations, that
result from objectives
we impose on the histogram of the image.
Spatial Filtering, both linear and spatial
L-variant, and non-linear.
We'll see examples for filtering
for noise smoothing, sharpening,
Homomorphic filtering.
Applications of psuedo coloring and some
examples on video enhancement.
Let us proceed now with the first topic on
the list.
