Hello again, in this segment we cover
some general material about video
compression standards.
They come from two international parties
ITU-T and MPEG.
Although recently they have collaborated
to create
for example the two most recent standards.
All video compression standards utilize
the structure of the hybrid
motion compensator video encoder that we
covered in the previous segment.
MPEG-4 deviates in some sense slightly by
adding
the encoding of the shape in the mix.
The standards however are generic.
In that they only specify the syntax and
semantics
of the code in bitstream and the code in
process.
In other words, they don't specify the
operations of the encoder.
They do not specify how motion estimation
would be performed.
For example, as long as a motion vector
per
microblock is present in the bitstream in
a particular location.
This obviously does not provide any
quality guarantees at the decoder.
But provides great flexibility and
empowers
the values implemented in the standard.
And the companies that will build these
dot
cameras for acquiring the video or Blu-Ray
players.
To distinguish their products from the
competition.
We also show some experimental results
comparing the value standards.
Its more or less the case that the
objective of each new standard
to obtain the same quality with its
predecessor and how the [UNKNOWN] is met.
The natural question of course arises, of
how far can one compress a given video?
High resolution frames, the target of the
more recent standards
have of course higher correlation and
therefore more room for improvement.
But still the standards are doing a
wonderful job in pushing the envelope.
So let's dive into this exciting material.
There exist a number of successful
international video coding standards.
The success is measured by the fact that
they've been adopted by
the industry, and they can be found in
numerous applications and products.
The video corporation standards have been
created
by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group.
And more specifically, this group created
H.261 and H.263.
Also by the ISO/IEC Moving Pictures
Experts Group, MPEG.
And this group created MPEG-1 and MPEG-4
Visual.
And from their collaborated effort under
the
name of Joint Collaborative Team on Video
Coding.
That created the more recent standards,
H.262, that's the ITU
and, and MPEG 2-Video is the MPEG name for
the same standard.
And similarly H.264 and H.265 they latest
video compression standard.
The numbering indicates the time sequence
in which the standards were created.
The rule of thumb is that with any newer
standard, the same performance with the
previous standard is achieved.
In terms of peak, peak [UNKNOWN] peak
signal to noise ratio at half the bitrate.
So, the newer standards are replacing the
older ones.
Although in principle each standard
addresses specific applications, or there
is
typically a killer app, as the terminology
goes, behind each standard.
By and large they standardized ideas which
have appeared in the literature.
But now, they're specifically tested to
make
sure the best possible performance is
obtained.
The standards become more sophisticated
and
more computationally heavy as time goes
on.
The computational resources however
increase at a fast rate.
So it's possible now to consider more
elaborate schemes
in performing motion estimation or spatial
prediction or transfer coding.
While allocating the available bits in the
best possible preferably optimal way.
Some general comments regarding the
standards are that they all use
the Hybrid Motion Compensated encode,
Encoding Scheme that we have talked about.
The standards are generic.
They do not specify the operations of the
encoder but instead the
syntax and semantics of the coded
bitstream and the decoding process.
So a bit-stream that is compliant to a
specific
standard can be decoded by the decoder of
that standard.
So there is no guarantee of the end
to end quality, the quality of the
constructed video.
But this way there is great freedom to
optimize implementations so that are
appropriate to specific applications.
Whereby somebody can balance compression
quality, implementation
cost, time to market and other
considerations.
Finally the standards follow a toolkit
approach
through the various pro, profiles as we'll
see.
And depending on the application somebody
need
only use certain features of a given
standard.
We showed here the same block diagram of
the
hybrid motion compensated video encoder
that we have already analysed.
One difference that the blocks are now
color coded to
indicate the file that the standards only
specified the decoder.
Or the syntax and schematics of the coded
bit stream and the decoding process.
So yellow represents proprietary
algorithms.
Like I've actually added the Preprocessor
here.
Which is typically present in any coder
and is usually here to perform
resizing, color conversion from a given
former for example, YCBCR.
Noise smoothing, conversion from
interlaced to progressive etc.
One can design an encoder with the
objective
of simply increasing the performance of
the coder.
So motion estimation is certainly a
proprietary issue.
It's not specified by the standard, how to
perform it.
As long as motion vectors for each block
are provided
to the decoder in a specific location in
the bitstream.
As discussed in week four, when we covered
motion estimation.
The designer can choose the trade-off
between speed of calculation of the
motion vectors and accuracy of the vectors
or size of the prediction error.
This is clearly a design choice.
Similarly, rate control is a proprietary
issue.
And it typically has a major effect on the
overall quality of the compressed video.
There are choices also to be made when
entropy encoding is performed.
The Magenta color represents blocks fixed
by the standard.
And finally the Cyan color represents
proprietary possible
value add, having an efficient and
[UNKNOWN] mechanism.
To decide, to decide whether a block
should be coded as intra or inter.
In collaboration of course with the rate
controller can
clearly affect your video quality of your
encoded video.
And also increase its robustness to
channel letters.
And as I already mentioned, the quality
of the standard compliance stream can vary
tremendously.
I've also edit here information regarding
Header Information.
But also needs to be to sent to the
decoder
such as the picture type, block type, time
stamps etc.
That we see what exactly some of these
mean later on.
Finally, there is also typically audio
associated with a video.
Which is multiplexed with the video and
sent over a pipe for example when
Inter or intranet, the wireless network
cable, satellite link etc.
We show here for completeness the decoder
which we analysed earlier.
But also with a various blocks color coded
with the same interpretation as in the
previous slide.
The bitstream decoder here also addresses
error resilience, resynchronization, and
error concealment.
We've included also a postprocessor block,
which
is typically found in any video decoder.
Its purpose is to do formative sampling,
composition,
further concealment, coding, noise
reduction, and so on.
Its purpose is, in general, to increase
the visual
quality of the decoded bit stream as much
as possible.
And efficient Postprocessing units can
have magnificent
effect on the quality of the contrasted
video.
If in certain applications actually the
Preprocessor and
Postprocessor can communicate then
improved results can obtain.
We show here in this table some of the
earlier
standards, the latest to H.264 and H.265
are not included.
So we see the bodies that created them and
the application in mind.
So these are the ITU standards and these
are the MPEG standards, so
communication applications are the primary
applications here.
Why entertainment coming in this
direction.
Then we see there the dates of
standardization,
1990, 92, 94, 96, 99.
There's a first version that is released
and
then there are revised versions that, that
follow.
Here are the primary applications.
Communication type of applications here.
Video conferencing.
Wireless or wide line.
While here storage of the video.
Broadcasting under MPEG-2.
Actually MPEG-2 is the adopted standard
for digital high definition television.
And then MPEG-4 has, it's quite a number
of applications here.
And we'll talk actually about them MPEG-4
has quite
some interesting differences from the
standards before and after it.
We see here the bit rates, smaller images
and here are the typical frame sizes.
So this to a couple.
Actually the smallest size here we see is
quarter CIF,
quarter common intermediate format, a tiny
frame 176 by 144.
If we double the size above the actions we
end up with CIF.
Related to that is SIF, standard
intermediate format.
And then we see accommodation 601.
So these are the sizes and then we see the
rate, so
well, the kilobyte range here, while doing
the megabits per second range here.
And MPEG-4 actually covers pretty much the
whole range from
20 kilobyte all the way up to 6 megabits
per second.
Finally we saw the video compression
standards that are associated
auto-compression standards.
And depending on the application for these
communication applications
here, speech is all we are interested in
compressing.
While with the applications coming from
MPEG we are interested
in stereo, CD quality, surround sound, and
so on.
As already mentioned, the rule of thumb in
designing a new compression standard is
to achieve the same quality as the
previous generation one at half the
bitrate.
We show here some experimented results
with some of the earliest standards.
Using this particular sequence, Foreman,
it's a QCIF resolution,
10 frames per second and 100 frames in
coding.
So what it will show is the rate
distortion performance of video coders.
So on the horizontal axis is the rate in
kilobits per second while on the
vertical axis the quality in terms of PSNR
and in terms of dB.
So, going back to 70s and 90s, if each
frame of the sequence is encoded as a JPEG
frame.
This is the rate distortion performance we
obtain.
Utilizing the frame difference and
encoding it, this curve is shifted.
With H.261 the curve is further shifted,
MPEG-1 and H.263 performance.
So in a span here of the years from 74 or
92 depending which way you count til 98.
We see that at a given a quality, the
bit-rate is reduced by 67%.
Clearly if we look at a different quality
level, then this reduction,
let's say at six dB, then this reduction
is even greater.
And of course, this here refers to this
particular sequence at this resolution.
Some of the newer standards, for example
80265, address extremely
high resolution frames, UHD, such as 4k,
and 8k resolution frames.
But in general, the question is, how far
can we push these curves for a specific
sequence.
If there is a limit based on which you
cannot further compressed the data.
We show here the results of a similar
experiment as before they encoded
sequences Foreman again.
But now its CIF resolution so four times
larger than the previous experiment.
And the frame rate is 30 frames per
second.
We go back here H.264 with MPEG-4
standard profile plus Q, MPEG-4 standard
profile and H.263 baseline.
The observations are similar as before.
If for example look at this operational
point, so this effect
four and 400 km per second and the quality
is 35 dp.
And we see that we can achieve the same
quality with this operational
point, which is around 200 kilobytes per
second.
So same quality at almost half the rate in
going from one generation to the next.
But clearly since there are various
profiles that the standard
can utilize, these curves vary, are
shifted as shown here.
But the direction is the direction of, of
improvement.
Following more or less the rule of thumb
that they mentioned.
Here is yet another comparison among
various, video compression standards.
What they're showing here is the bit rate
savings when the quality is kept the same.
Videos that are suitable for entertainment
applications were used so rather large
format.
And a number of experiments were
conducted, so
what's shown here is the average bit rate
savings.
So, we see the comparison here of
the latest standard, the high efficiency
video coding.
Which is also, here is the name of
H.265 against a good number of previous
generation standards.
And the same is done for 264, MPEG-4 and
263.
So clearly the general observation is that
when we compare a newer
standard to it's previous generation ones,
there is bit rate savings.
Which is not always at 50% or larger as we
would
like it to be maybe or is the rule of
thumb indicates.
But we see here that 265 compared to 264
for
this set of experiments, it uses a bit
rate by 35.4%.
And these savings keep increasing as we
move back
in time and reach 70.8% when compared to
MPEG-2.
A similar story for 264, actually close to
50% here.
MPEG-4 compared to 263, we see small
savings.
H.263 compared to MPEG-2 we see relatively
small saving.
What it should be kept in mind here is
the size, the resolution of the frame is
important.
Because as we already mentioned, every
standard
is designed with different applications in
mind.
Or put is differently as the expression
goes, there
is a sweet spot of operation of each
standard.
It's working performing best for certain
resolutions.
So for example H.265 adresses UHD
resolutions
4K, 8K, resolutions while 263 down here
works
with little images such as QCIF and CIF
resolutions.
So here videos suitable for entertainment
applications
were used where the resolutions were
relatively large.
And therefore, you might say that some of
the newer standards are slightly favored.
However, with one should definitely keep
in mind.
That when conventions like this are made
that again, the
testing material is not outside the sweet
spot of standard.
Otherwise it becomes an unfair comparison.
