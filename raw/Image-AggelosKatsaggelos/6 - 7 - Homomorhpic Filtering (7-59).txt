Hello and welcome back, in this segment we
will discuss homomorphic filtering.
It is a concept developed in the 60s
by Oppenheim Schaefer in Stockholm,
according to which a
nonlinear mapping is first applied to a
signal,
then linear filtering is performed with
this new domain.
And finally, the signal is transformed
back to
the original domain by applying the
inverse transformation.
The concept is general, and can be applied
to the processing of any signal.
For example, speech, audio and, of course,
images.
This concept is utilized here with the
objective of decreasing
the dynamic range while increasing the
local contrast of an image.
Based on a model of an image, as
the product of a slowly varying
illumination term, and
the fast varying reflectance term, after
taking the logarithm
of the image, the two terms are now
additive.
They can then be separated by LSI
filtering.
Then, in the frequency domain, the
illumination term is reduced while the
reflectance term is boosted,
exponentiation is then performed, the
inverse of the log, so as to bring the
image back to its original domain.
We will explain all these steps in this
segment and also show an imaging sample.
So, let us proceed with this topic.
And, I hope you find it interesting and
exciting.
The interesting concept of homomorphic
filtering, as applied
specifically to an image enhancement task,
is presented next.
We'll introduce homomorphic filtering in
the context of solving
a specific enhancement problem that we
will explain right away.
However, it should become clear with
homomorphic filtering is a
more general framework that can be used to
solve various problems.
So, the problem at hand is that we have a
image with
a large dynamic range, such as a natural
scene on a bright day.
And, such an image is recorded on a, on a
medium with a small dynamic range.
And the result is that there is a
significant
contrast reduction, especially in the dark
and bright regions.
So, therefore, the objective is, given an
image, how can
we reduce the dynamic range while
increasing the local contrast.
We model given image x as a product of two
terms, the illumination
term i n1 and 2, which is assumed to be
slowly varying.
A low frequency term and contributes
mainly to the dynamic range.
And this is multiplied by the reflectance,
which represents the details and
is therefore rapidly varying, and is the
primary contributor to the local contract.
So, with this model, the problem we set
out to solve is to decrease
the dynamic range, therefore decrease the
term i n1 and 2, while
increasing the local contrast as expressed
by the reflectance.
Clearly the difficulty here, the challenge
is that I have
the product of these two terms, the
illumination with the
reflectance and I would, therefore, like
to separate them before
being able to process each one separately
according to my objectives.

Homomorphic processing comes to our
rescue.
The main idea behind homomorphic
processing is to take the original signal,
the original image, and through the
logarithmic operation, map it onto another
domain.
Then we perform our processing, our
desired processing in
that other domain and after we obtain the
signal,
we want to undo the operation of the
logarithm,
therefore, the end result, that operation
is the exponentiation.
So, I exponentiate here the signal and it
brings me here to the native] domain.
So, based on the model we used for the
image
as the product of the illumination term
with the reflectance term.
If I take the log of the image, it will
give me the sum of the logs.
So, it's the log of the illumination, the
first term here, plus the log of the
reflectance.
This first term is a low-frequency term,
and
my objective is to decrease it while the
log of the reflectance is a high
mid-frequency
term, and my objective is to increase it.
So, I want to decrease the dynamic range
here while I want to increase the local
contrast.
So, starting with the original image,
taking the log, then
we take the output and low bus filter it,
this will isolate the first component.
The log of the illumination.
I want to decrease it, therefore I
multiply
it with a gamma one less than one.
At the other hand, I high pass the signal
y1.
This will let the second component, the
high frequency component, go through.
That's the log of the reflectance.
I want to ampl, amplify that, therefore, I
multiply by gamma 2 greater than 1.
I add up the two terms.
I just exponentiate them, and come back to
the original domain.
So, for this particular, again, image
model is
the product of the illumination with the
reflectance.
Homomorphic processing is the natural
framework to be applied.
And that would allow us to achieve our
objectives, which
is to decrease the dynamic range while
increasing the local contrast.
So, here's again, the block diagram of the
overall system,
and summarizing y2 n1 n2 as the output of
the filtering
operation here, so it's approximately
equal to gamma 1, the log
of the illumination plus gamma 2 the log
of the reflectance.
And after exponentiation, my output, I
call here x0
is the illumination component raised to
the gamma 1 power, times the
reflectance component raised to the gamma
2 power and gamma 1
is less than 1 while gamma 2 is greater
than 1.
So, here is the overall filtering
operation results in
really filtering y1 here by a filter which
is readily
symmetric and has the shape, low
frequencies multiplied by
gamma 1, while high frequencies multiplied
by a gamma 2.
So, we are doing our filtering in the log
intensity
domain, which is also referred to as a
perceptual domain.
Since it reflects some of the properties
of
the human visual system, according to
which intensities
are modified at the peripheral level using
some
type of non linearity such as the
logarithmic operation.
Here's an image weu would like to enhance
through homomorphic filtering.
The local contrast seems to be low in the
dark regions, for example here, maybe back
here as well.
So, here's a result we obtained by
applying the procedure I just described.
Actually, the values were gamma 1 equals
to 1 and gamma 2 equals to 2.
And one can see that indeed the local
contrast has increased in a region like
this,
maybe back here, but also the numbers seem
to be sharper on the face of the clock.
