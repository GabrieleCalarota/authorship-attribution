Welcome back.
[UNKNOWN] systems or systems theory, we're
typically interested
in the number of properties that systems
might have.
For example, we are interested if the
systems are stable.
an important properties, since you might
say that
in general unstable systems are of not
much use.
Whether they are causal, [UNKNOWN] and so
on.
All of these are independant of each
other.
One property does not require another
property,
or does not lead to another property.
Out of all possible 2D systems, we're
primarily
interested in systems that have two
important properties.
They're both linear and spatially
invariant.
That's forming LSI systems.
We'll be introducing them in this segment.
These two properties define an important
subset of all possible 2d systems.
Linearity means that the, a sum of signals
is that the input of a linear system, the
system can process each signal separately,
and add up the processed signals.
Spatially variance, means that, It is
irrelevant where
the origin of the coordinate system is
located.
As we'll see in the next two segments, we
can describe
and implement LSI systems efficiently in
the spatial domain through convolution.
We can also describe them in the frequency
domain as we'll see in week three.
They're therefore friendly systems.
In that they reveal their properties to us
in a rather straightforward way,
but the same time, extremely useful and
widely used in a number of applications.
So, let us see how LSI systems can be
defined
mathematically, and also let us look at
some simple examples.
So far we've talked about signals, two
dimensional,
multi-dimensional signals in general, we
have examples of
some important signals such as the delta,
and
the cosine that will be using throughout
this class.
We are interested in processing or
manipulating such signals through systems.
So x in 1 and 2, is the input image to
start the system.
Y is the output, which is equal to a
transformed version of the input.
A manipulated version of the input.
Some examples of such signals y n1 n2
is equal to 255 minus x and 1 and 2.
Assuming these images are eightbits per
pixel.
Therefore the range from 0 to 55.
What such a system does is changing the
polarity
of the input is turning black values into
white, and white values into black.
So a negative into a positive or a
positive into a negative.
We going to have another system that
performs this
transformation to the input values
according to this function.
And what the system does is stretching the
intensity values of the input image.
We'll see actually quite a few systems of
this nature when I talk about image
enhancement.
Similarly, we have a system, that provides
an output which is equal to the average
of the input values in a neighborhood
denoted here by n.
So this denotes a neighborhood
of input values.
And yet as a final example, I can have a
system that gives me the output,
the medium of the input values again in
the neighborhood.
When we talk about systems we're
interested in a number
of their properties, some of which are
mentioned here.
Whether, if the system is stable, whether
it is has memory, or is memory less,
whether it's causal, whether it's linear,
and whether it's spatial invariant.
All these five here listed properties are
independent of each other.
A system can have all of them, none of
them, just one or two, and so on.
And out of all these five properties we're
going to
focus next on systems that have the last
two properties.
And [UNKNOWN] systems, we'll be referring
to them as linear
and spatially invariant systems, are quite
useful, are used very widely.
And it's relatively straightforward to
describe such systems, both in
the spatial domain as well as in the
frequency domain.
A two-imensional system is linear if
it satisfies the homogeneity property
shown here.
In other words, if at the input of the
system might put the
weighted sum of two signals, the weight is
alpha one and alpha two.
And if at the output, I find the weighted
sum of the individual outputs.
So alpha 1, the response of the system to
x1 plus alpha
2, the response of the system to x2, then
the system is linear.
This is clearly a very useful properties,
because in many applications,
I have to process the sum, weighted sum of
individual images.
And it might be easier to process each
image
individually and add up the responses, or
looking at it
the reverse way, in some sense, I can take
any signal and decompose it into simpler
symbols, simpler images.
Which then I process individually, and
again I add up the individual responses.
From this equation it's clear that if
alpha 2 is equal to 0
then the response of the system to alpha 1
x 1
n 1 and 2 is simply alpha 1 The response
of the system, x1.
So if an image is multiplied by scalar, I
don't need to be
concerned, I can process the image and
then multiply the output by the scalar.
Similarly, If alpha1 equals minus alpha2,
and x1
equals x2.
Since this property holds for any x1, x2.
And then you wait.
Then, I see that the response to alpha one
x one,
minus alpha one x one,
which is equal to zero, right?
So the response to the zero signal Is
equal to
alpha 1 the response to x 1.
Minus alpha 1 the response to x 1.
Which is equal to zero.
So, in other words, we see that the system
is linear when I
put the zero in the input, I find a zero
in the output.
Now, this is a property that can be shared
also by non-linear systems, therefore,
therefore it's a property that I cannot
use to prove that the system is linear.
But I can use to prove that the system is
non-linear.
And this is a simple example, we can
proceed there the system, that
we looked at the previous slide, so using
the notation here YN1
is the response of the system to X X as an
input, right?
And we define the system as 255 minus X,
N1, N2, right?
So, it's like the system takes an eight
bit
image and inverts it, finds the negative
of it, right?
.
So clearly if I put a zero as the input of
the system, the output
equals 255, hich is different than zero,
and therefore this system that
finds the negative of an image is
non-linear.
Generally speaking is rather forward to
utilize
this homogenize property in this equation
that
you see here on top, and prove or disprove
that the system is linear.
And this property and everything that we
covered here, this light applies to
twodimensional Systems
and signals as well as one dimensional,
three
dimensional, five dimensional signals and
systems in general.
Let us consider again the two dimensional
system T, x n one
and two they input y, n one and two to the
output.
[UNKNOWN]
system if when I sift the input
By k1, k2, I find that the output is
shifted
by the same amounts, k1, k2, then, the
system is spatially invariant.
Another way to express this, is that to
say that the system does not care
about the location of the axis, does not
care where the 0,0 point is located.
This properties important by itself, but
even more important when
combined with linearity as we're going to
see right away.
Now this property is independent of
linearities, so if we consider
the system we looked at earlier,
which for an input x n1, n2
generates as output 255 minus x n1, n2.
So the system finds a negative of an eight
bit image.
We saw that this system is non-linear.
Now, if I shift the input to the system by
x n1 minus k1.
So, I shifted by k1, k2.
And I put this as input to the system.
The output is equal to 255 minus x n1
minus k1, n2 minus k2, which is clearly
Equal to the shifted output.
Therefore, the system is spatially
invariant, SI.
So, the system takes the negative of an
image is no linear, but is spatially
Spatially invariant.
As another example, if I look at this,
this system that multiplies
the input by a time varying gain, so this.
C is a gain, but changes according to the
location of the pixel n1 and n2.
It is rather straightforward for you to
verify that.
So the system is linear, but is
not spatially
invariant or it is spacially varying.
That's another way to express it.
Again, this particular property faults
through
everything we talked about here for,
calls to for one dimensional, three
dimensional, multi-dimensional in general
systems and signals.
Let us look now at systems that
are both linear and spatially invariant
LSI systems.
Such systems are used widely, and we have
developed
very useful and convenient tools to
describe and analyze them.
Now, such systems can be completely
described by a signal that
we'll, we'll be referring to as the
impulse response of the system.
As the name implies, if I put a delta at
the input of sight
system and measure the output which I'll
denote by h, and oneand two.
This is again the response of the system
to an impulse, and we will refer
to it as the impulse
response of the LSI system.
This is not just a mathematical construct,
but in
many cases, I can utilize the system, such
as a
camera and point the camera to a printout
that is,
a black background and a white spot in the
middle.
Or I can point the telescope that is
orbiting
outside the atmosphere, such as the Hubble
Space Telescope, to
a distant star in the dark sky measure
that
is force and that's the impulse response
of the system.
Knowing the impulse response now again I
can completely describe
the system which means for any input X n1,
n2.
I can find the output of the system,
and this is equal to the convolution of
the input, with the impulse response of
the system.
So this double star here denotes the two
dimensional discrete
convolution.
So linear systems or filters, as we
often refer to, are perform convolution,
discrete convolution.
The convolution of x
with h, as we will show,
is equal to this super position sum.
K1 minus infinity, infinity, k2 minus
infinity, infinity, x k1,
k2, h, n1 minus k1, n2 minus k2.
I'll show some examples of performant
convolution in the following slides.
It's easy to verify by substituting
variables
that the convolution he's the communitive
property so in other words
convolution of x with a equals convolution
of a with x.
