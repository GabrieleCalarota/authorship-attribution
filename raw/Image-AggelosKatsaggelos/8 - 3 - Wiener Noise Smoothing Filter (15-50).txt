Hello, in this segment we consider the
noise smoothing problem.
That is the case when the impulses points
of
the variance system is equal to the
dimensional delta function.
In this case if we said the frequency
response of the varying
filter equal to one and the expression of
the winner restoration filter.
The Wiener noise smoothing filter results.
This does not become an enhancement
problem
however, since the Wiener smoothing filter
was derived
based on a modelling of the degradation
and the optimization of a specific
objective function.
Therefore, under these conditions, it is
an optimal noise smoothing filter.
We
also derive a specially adaptive version
of the noise smoothing filter.
Each pixel now in the image is processed
differently, based
on the special activity of the
neighborhood it belongs to.
So, let's proceed with a material of this
segment.
I can use the Wiener filter to perform
noise smoothing.
So, in this case the impulse response of
the degradation system is a delta.
A delta convolved with f will give me f,
i, j here, so
therefore the degradation model now is
sigma plus noise.
I observe an image, which equals the
originally
merge plus the noise that was added to
that.
So under the same assumptions as before,
that is f and w are wide and stationary.
F and w are correlated and they are both
zero mean.
I can obtain now the form of the Wiener
noise smoothing filter.
Since here, h i j is a delta function, we
know from
what we have learned before that the
frequency
response of the filter is equal to one.
So substituting this in the expression we
had for the Wiener restoration filter
we obtain just the frequency response of
the noise smoothing Wiener filter.
So this exactly the point that was
made earlier on when we talked about
enhancement.
We have again the signal plus noise
problem here, and when we talked about
enhancement,
we'd argue that a low past type of filter
would remove some of the noise.
And then we would try different shapes of
the
filter and different extends of for a
given shape,
and visually evaluate the results and pick
the one
that would just be more suitable for our
purposes.
Instead here we have a specific objective
which is the
minimization of the mean squared error,
mean squared estimation error.
And this objective gives rise to this
expression for the Wiener noise smoothing
filter.
Having a dual use the Weiner noise
smoothing filter.
Here's another interpretation of the
Weiner restoration filter.
We show again here the degradation model.
We call g i j, the image at the output of
the LSI degradation system,
noise is then added to it, and we observe
y which therefore is equal to g plus w.
So y is the signal plus noise now model
where the
signal g is not the original signal but
instead the blend signal.
Now, we know that the power spectrum of g
equals to this.
This is one of the first expressions we
showed there, standard expressions
when we have random process at the input
of an LSI system.
Okay, now with that, here is the frequency
response of the
Wiener restoration filter that we saw a
couple of times already.
Clearly I can multiply this by one, so I
multiple by H omega1
omega2 divided by H omega1 omega2.
This is identity, well the exception of
well H is zero,
the frequency for which is zero, but we'll
assume that's perfectly fine.
And now I can combine this H complex
conjugate with this H.
And the product will give me the magnitude
squared of H omega1, omega2.
So then what I obtained I see here.
Here that H magnitude squared times P of
ff is P of gg, so that's the numerator
and I can substitute in the denominator,
so I have this expression now.
Right?
Again, I combined this H complex conjugate
with this H, and
with this P of ff and I got P of gg.
And then this down here is also P of gg,
omega1 omega2.
So we see that I can think of a
Wiener restoration filter as the product
of two filters.
The first filter is just smoothing the
noise.
Not with respect to the original signal
but with respect to the blurred signal.
So first, we take care of getting rid of
the noise.
And then, the noise free signal is inverse
the convult here.
I apply an inverse filter for the
deconvolution.
So this is an interpretation that
justifies again first getting rid of the
noise and then getting rid of the blur,
but in a very specific way within the
context of the Wiener restoration filter.
Actually people introduced all kinds of
modifications to this concept here, which
of course, here is mathematically
equivalent
to doing the Wiener restoration filter.
But I can alter the noise smoothing and
the inverse
filter and end up with combinations of of
other filters.
Let us look now at the derivation
of a spatially adaptive Wiener noise
smoothing filter.
This is the degradation model, it's signal
plus noise.
The observed image y equals the original
image f
plus the noise w that has been added to
it.
We assume that the noise is zero mean and
that
it is y, therefore it's spectral density
equals it's variance.
So, as we have seen for this model, the
frequency response of the Wiener filter is
given by
this expression, where I have already
substituted the spectral
density of the noise equal to sigma w
squared.
We are going to develop a filter that has
this step shown here.
So, the observed image y, from it the mean
m of f will be subtracted, then the
filter will develop the Wiener filter with
impulse response r i j will be applied.
The mid will be added back to the image
and
therefore the smoothed image is denoted by
p i j.
Maybe, motivated by the exact result we
show that got into which the
Weiner restoration filter is the
concatenation of
Weiner smoothing filter and then inverse
filter.
One can find in the literature a number of
results where two restoration filters are
combined in different ways.
One such result is shown here.
It's referred to as the geometric mean
filter, and we see that is the combination
of the generalized inverse filter and the
Weiner restoration filter.
So alpha equals, a half is the geometric
mean of
the two but alpha in general is between 0
into 1.
For alpha equals 0 we have the Wiener
filter for alpha equal 1 if we
have the inverse filter, and of course
any combination for the various values of
alpha.
In addition if you notice here there's a
gamma parameter.
Weighting this stabilizing term in the
denominator of the Weiner filter.
So this now starts feeling more like an
enhancement problem, since these
two parameters in this particular case,
alpha and gamma need to be
specified by the user based on the visual
quality of the restored image.
And again this is just one example of the
many such examples one could find in the
literature.
We want to modify the Wiener noise
smoothing filter so
that it adapts to the local
characteristics of the image.
Towards this task we divide the image into
stationary regions.
And then for each region, we assume that
the following model holds for the image.
So, f i j is equal to the local mean
plus the standard deviation
multiplied by a noise term, and for this
noise term, we assume that it's mean is
equal to zero while its variance is equal
to one.
Empirical evidence suggests that it is a
reasonable model
for typical images and typical process,
image processing applications.
Now for each of these regions, I can write
down the frequency response of the noise
smoothing filter.
P of f f based on this model is equal to
sigma f squared.
So, we see that the filter here
is constant, does not depend on omega1,
omega2.
So, if I take this back to the time
domain, the
impulse response of the Weiner noise
smoothing filter is equal to this.
So, the constant gave rise to a delta in
the special domain.
Let's look now at the model we've been
using towards this noise smoothing filter.
So we take the input image, subtract the
mean, process it
through the filter, add back the mean to
get the output.
So the equation therefore is that P of i j
equals i minus the mean convolved
with the impulse response of the noise
smoothing filter and adding back the mean.
So if I substitute here for r i j equal to
we have already found over here since I
convolved with the delta.
It means that the signal goes through and
therefore, this is what I obtain.
So, this the output of the noise smoothing
filter for a specific stationary region.
Now, if I shrink the region to the pixel.
Then the local variance becomes a function
of i
j and so does the local mean, and this
gives rise to the special adaptive Wiener
noise smoothing
filter which you will see in the next
slide.
So based on the analysis and the result we
obtained in the previous slide.
If each region, the image was divided into
is shrunk down to a single pixel, then the
local variance of the image becomes a
function
of i j, and so does the local mean.
After rearranging terms, we find that the
output of the noise
smoothing filter at location i j is a
convex combination of the input
at the same location and the local mean of
the image.
So, this is the expression of
the specially adaptive Wiener noise
smoothing filter.
It's a different filter in essence that is
applied to each and every pixel in the
image.
So, let's look at some special cases of
this filter.
So first of all, if there is no noise
added to the data, then
the output image, it's simply equal to the
input image, which makes perfect sense.
The input image is noise free.
Therefore, there is absolutely no need to
do any filtering to the image.
If I look at the edge ridges of the image,
at those locations, then the
local variance of the image is much
greater than the variance of the noise.
And if I take this into account and look
at this equation.
The first term here is approximately equal
to one while the second coefficient is
approximately
equal to zero, and therefore the output of
the filter is approximately equal to the
input.
And this also makes perfect sense based on
the arguments I made at an earlier point
that
based on properties of the human visual
system, the
masking properties, noise is not visible
at the edges.
Therefore, noise goes through the filter
at the edge location.
This is not visible.
And this also allows us to leave the edges
unfiltered.
So therefore we obtain sharp edges, and
the noise
is not visible, so this is a desirable
result.
Now if we look at the flat regions, then
the local
variance of the image is much smaller than
the noise variance.
And then if I look at the coefficient, the
first one is approximately equal to zero.
While the second one approximately equal
to one,
and therefore the output is a smoothed
version of
the input and the output that, that pixel
location
is equal to the local mean of the input.
I want to comment now on computing some of
these parameters here.
Actually I, I called m of f the local mean
of the input, and this is
correct because the noise is zero mean,
because
of the modelling assumptions early on, and
therefore this approximately holds true.
Now, as far as finding the variance of the
noise,
if I first of all the, the model I've been
using is that y equals f plus w.
I omitted the i j here.
And to do the fact that signal and noise
aren't correlated.
I do have that sigma y squared equals
sigma f squared plus sigma w squared.
So if I look at the flat region of the
image then
at that region sigma of f is.
Where it's approximately equal to zero and
therefore, what
I measure if I loc, measure the local
variance.
It's approximately equal to the variance
of the noise.
So, this is one way to obtain an estimate
of the variance
of the noise and then if I look at any
other region.
I can obtain the variance of the image as
the
variance of the data minus the variance of
the noise.
So since I know the variance of the noise
I have already calculate it.
I measure this I can find this way the
local variance of the image.
