[BLANK_AUDIO]
Welcome back.
I hope you enjoyed the first week of
class, during which you covered the
introductory material.
In this and next week, we will
cover the fundamentals of two-dimensional
signals and systems.
We're interested in describing some
important and useful signals.
One of them, as you'll see, the complex
exponential, is the building block
of any signal, and we're also interested
in the input-output relations of systems.
This week, we will carry this discussion
in the spatial domain,
while next week we will move the
discussion to the frequency domain.
We use two-dimensional signals and systems
in our presentation.
However, all the information it provides
is also applicable to one-dimensional
signals, but also to higher-dimensional
signals,
that is, multi-dimensional signals in
general.
We will become now more specific and talk
about important to the
signals, the ones you encounter often and
systems that process those signals.
We're primarily interested in the
algorithmic or the mathematical,
or the software implementation of such
systems in this course.
We will then move on as specific class of
two dimensional systems that have 2
important properties that these are linear
and time invariant or special invariant.
Such systems are very useful and popular
for processing images and videos
and they're friendly in the sense that
they allow us to describe them
in a succinct way in the special domain
through their impulse response,
but also allow us to look at their
behavior in the frequency domain.
This week's material forms the backbone of
any course on multidimensional signal and
systems.
Equipped with the knowledge you'll acquire
this week, you'll be able to understand
any paper or work that deals with the
processing of signals in any dimension.
If you already have had a course on one
dimensional signal processing, then the
material I'll be presenting here these two
weeks will reinforce your knowledge of the
topic.
We will simply add one independent
variable to our signal representation,
and we'll take everything from the
one-dimensional line, to the
two-dimensional plane.
If this is the first time you are exposed
to this
material, don't be discouraged if
everything is not clear right away.
It might take some time and experience for
everything to sink in.
We will be utilizing some of these ideas
throughout the course.
So by the end of the course, everything
should become much clearer.
I will clearly be presenting only basic
material which
will be required for the remaining of the
course.
For those of you interested in this
specific topic, there is a plethora
of books and resources that will allow you
to look deeper into the topic.
In this first segment, we'll introduce
some
conventions representing 2D and 3D spaces
and
then, we'll introduce 2 basic two
dimensional
signals, the unit impulse and the unit
step.
We will see that both of these signals are
separable signals.
So let's proceed with the material of this
second week.
Let us first establish some notations and
conventions
when we deal with 2-D and 3-D discrete
signals.
Let x-n1 and -n2 be a two-dimensional
signal.
n1 and n2 are then dependent variables.
They're integers, they take value 0,
plus-minus-1, plus-minus-2.
And mathematically speaking, a signal, an
image can have infinite support.
That is the values that n1 and n2 take are
between minus infinity and plus infinity.
When it comes to the orientation of the
axis, I can use
n1 as the horizontal axis and to the
vertical one with this orientation.
That's how we're used to presenting
functions in calculus.
So, here is 0.
Here is the point n minus 1.
Here's the point m minus 1.
So this is an n by m image.
So if this is n1 prime, this is m2 prime,
then
here is the pixel with coordinates n1
prime, n2 prime.
The value of the pixel is in general a
real number.
Now drawing from the way matrices are
represented on the computer, I can pick
the n1 axis this way and the n2 axis gone,
to have gone like this.
So in this case if I pick the
same n1 prime, it would be here,
approximately here.
The same n2 prime would be approximately
here and therefore, this is now
the pixel with coordinates n1 prime, n2
prime.
Clearly as long as the orientation of the
axis is
known, the result of processing an image
should be identical.
It shouldn't matter which way I have
chosen to represent the axis.
When I deal with color images, then there
are
3 channels involved, the blue, the green,
the red channel.
If these channels are added up, I end up
with a color image.
So if this is the n1 axis, and this is the
n2
axis, again, the location, the
n1 prime, n2 prime location of the
pixel of the same, the pixel of the same
location xn1 prime, n2
prime, but the difference now from the
previous case is, is that x n1
prime, n2 prime is now a vector, a 3 by
1 vector where I have the value of the red
channel
at this location followed by the value of
the green channel at the same
location followed with value of the blue
channel at same location.
Okay, so the algebra representation.
So x, therefore in the general
presentation can
be a scalar or it can be a vector.
When I deal with three-dimensional
discrete signals, then xn1
and 2 and 3 is the representation n1, n2,
n3 are integers.
And again, mathematically speaking, they
can
range from minus infinity to plus
infinity.
So, here is a collection of frames
representing a video.
So I can choose n1.
Going down this way, n2 is the second axis
and 3 is the third
axis, it represents discrete values of the
time domain.
And now, nx, n1 prime and 2 prime and 3
prime
would be a pixel, let's say, n3 prime is
here, it will be a pixel in this frame
with the
other 2 coordinates n1 prime, n2 prime.
A little bit hard to exactly represent it
in this case, but you do get the idea.
We'll just now talk about some specific
signals that
we would be making use of in this class.
The first one is the unit impulse.
It will be noted by delta n1, n2, and by
definition
is equal to 1 when the arguments are equal
to 0.
So if here on the 2d plain, here's n1,
here's
n2, then I'll denote delta like this, and
the height of the delta equals 1.
I can shift the delta around, so I can
write delta
n1 minus n1 prime, n2 minus n2 prime.
And then according to the definition, it's
equal to 1 as long as
the arguments are equal to 0
and 0 otherwise.
So from here, we see that it's 0 when n1
equals n1
prime and n2 equals n2 prime.
So again if I'm to sketch it, depending on
the
values of n1 and 2, I have not restricted
them.
So let's say n1 prime is here and n2
prime is here, therefore in this case I
have a
signal like this, so it's a delta, its
value's 1,
and it's 0 everywhere else, everywhere
else on the plane.
I can talk about the three-dimensional
delta by introducing an n3 there, so the
definition will extend to be 1 when n1
equals n2 equals n3 equals 0.
An interesting notion is the notion of
separable signals.
A signal g is separable if it can be
written as f1
which is a function only of the one
variable, n1 times a
function of 2 which is a function of the
second variable, omni.
The question then is whether the 2D delta
is separable, separable signal, and the
answer is yes.
We can if we let's, let's look at it
pictorially first, right?
If I have a signal but it looks like this.
So it's a line of deltas.
So it's 1 on the vertical axis and 0
everywhere
else and all these values are equal to 1,
right?
And then if I have a signal that,
here's a line of impulses on the
horizontal axis, so, with solid
dots here, [UNKNOWN] value of 1, and the
signal is 0 everywhere else, right?
So now if I multiply these two signals,
then it should be clear by just
these pictures I'm drawing here that I
multiply
it like this, one is multiplied by 0 here,
this one is multiplied by 0 over here.
This one is multiplied by 0 at this
location and it's only
this one here at the origin that is
multiplied by 1 here
and therefore the result is just this
signal which of course is
just, we have to find if this is delta n1
and 2.
Now what is the first signal equal to,
this is a delta n1, right?
Because this is by definition equal to 1
when
the argument is equal to 0 and 0
otherwise.
But I'm on the two-dimensional plane,
right, so delta n1 is
1 for n1 equals 0 and any value of n2, no
restriction on n2.
So therefore n1 equals
0 on the vertical axis, n1 equals 0 here,
n1 equals 0 here, here, here, here.
So this line of impulses, the first one is
represented by this
automatically by this function, delta,
delta n1 and similarly, this
line of impulses is a delta n2 signal.
Therefore delta n1 and 2 can be written as
delta n1 times delta n2
and it is therefore separable according to
the definition, right?
So delta n1 takes the place of f1 n1 in
the definition, right?
So this, I'll be writing the definition
here times f2 n2.
Another useful function is the discrete
unit step.
It's denoted by u.
And by definition, it's equal to 1 as long
as the its arguments are not negative.
So n1 is greater equal than 0, n2 greater
equal than 0.
So from the schedule here,
is again 1 as long as n1 is greater equal
than 0, but also n2 greater equal than 0.
[SOUND] So the values of the solid circles
is 1, and then the signal extends from
0 to infinity in the n1 direction,
and 0 to infinity the n2 direction.
We often label the quadrant; this is the
first quadrant, this is the
second one, this is the third one, this is
the fourth one.
And in this case we say that the, the
discrete unit step here support in the
first quadrant.
We can shift the unit step function
around, so if I have
n1 minus n1 prime, n2 minus n2 prime, then
by definition, this is equal to
1, as long as its arguments are not
negative and
0 otherwise.
So from here, we see that n1 is greater or
equal to n1 prime.
n2 is greater or equal to n2 prime.
So, if I'm to sketch this shifted
step depending on where n1 prime
and n2 prime are located, so
let's say, n1 prime is here
and n2 prime is here, right?
So then.
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Shift it.
The step function looks like this, and
extends
between this way, and continues this way.
So this is, the coordinates of this point
is n1 prime, n2 prime.
The next question is whether the unit step
is
separable as was the delta and the answer
is yes.
So, un1, n2 can be written as
un1 times un2 and pictorially,
un1 is 1 as long as n1 is
greater or equal than 0.
So, it looks like this.
[SOUND] Again, these solid
circles have a value 1.
So it extends to infinity this way.
This way and this way, right?
So this is un1, un2
is the signal that is
1 as long as n2 is non-negative, so it
will look like this.
Right?
So we fix them this way, this way, this
way, infinity.
So this is un2 and clearly if I multiply
these two signals,
then what I'll end up with is the unit
step, right?
So, it's going to be non zero only in the
first quadrant.
So, this is un1, n2.
